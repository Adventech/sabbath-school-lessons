Jesus identifies three places where the seed cannot grow and bear fruit (Mark 4:14–19). The seed that falls along the wayside takes no root at all. It bounces off the hard ground and is snatched up by the birds without ever germinating. On the stony ground, the seed sprouts but is unable to establish roots. It endures for only a short time before the sun scorches the plant and it withers away. The seed that falls among thorns develops roots and endures longer, but it, too, is eventually choked out.

The wayside response represents people who hear the message but don’t listen. They lack focus, comprehend little, and forget quickly. Perhaps you can relate to this. Have you ever read a chapter in the Bible only to realize that your thoughts were in a completely different place? We all struggle with concentrating at times.

The seed on the stony ground lacks roots and only endures until opposition arises. The book The Pilgrim’s Progress by John Bunyan describes a character named Pliable. He meets someone named Christian, who entices him with descriptions of the glories of the celestial city. They set off together, but as soon as they encounter the first obstacle at the Slough of Despond, Pliable abandons Christian, saying, “I have no problem changing my mind” (The Pilgrim’s Progress, episode 3, “Swamp of Despondency,” directed by Robert Fernandez, aired August 14, 2021, on YouTube, www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0bDA6ns2aQ). People often begin to resist God’s Word when they realize the cost of obeying and following.

The thorny ground is the saddest picture of all. Just like the thorns and thistles that slowly strangle a precious plant, so the cares of this world choke the Word from our hearts. This does not happen overnight. It happens gradually when we lose our love for God and channel it instead to the things of this world. Many who develop deep faith in God in their youth will slowly, nearly imperceptibly, drift away later. This is the thorny ground experience.

To avoid these pitfalls, we need to cultivate our hearts, making sure we are good ground. Good soil requires a balanced composition of nutrients. Many factors contribute to whether a person receives the word or rejects it. The makeup of our soil determines how much fruit the seed of the Word will yield in our heart—“some [bear fruit] thirtyfold, some sixty, and some a hundred” (Mark 4:20). We have no control over certain things in our environment, such as the place and circumstances of our upbringing. However, later in life, we can to some degree choose and create our environment. We choose our friends, interests, and values. We decide what principles will guide our lives. We have more control over our own “soil” than we realize. When we place ourselves in an uplifting environment and make choices that prioritize holistic development, the seed of God’s Word has a greater potential to bear good fruit.
