`What do you perceive as the central message in Jesus’ parable of the sower?`

`What strategies have you seen Satan use most effectively in choking out God’s Word? How can we combat those strategies?`

`How can a desire for Christ and His gospel replace a desire for other things that choke out the Word?`

`How have you experienced the “cares of this world” and the “deceitfulness of riches” competing against God’s Word (Mark 4:19)?`

`How can we make sure we are “good-ground” hearers, so that the seed (God’s Word) can bring spiritual growth into our lives?`

`Is there anything we can do to help our friends become “good-ground” hearers?`

`Jesus tells us that the seed sown on good ground produces fruit, “some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some a hundred” (Mark 4:20). What makes the difference, the seed or the soil? What does this teach us?`

`How can we become successful sowers of the gospel seed?`

`How can trials and challenges make us stronger followers of Jesus?`
