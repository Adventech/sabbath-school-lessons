Jesus was clearly using metaphors in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus. The parable wasn’t intended to provide a literal description of the afterlife but rather to show how the decisions we make today impact our eternal destinies. Several observations make this clear. For instance, Abraham’s bosom would never be big enough to hold all the redeemed, and a single drop of water would hardly bring relief to a burning person. Additionally, the idea of a lost person communicating with a saved person after death is simply inconsistent with the biblical picture of death.

The Bible emphasizes that humans are mortal beings who return to dust at death. It describes death as a sleep in which there is no consciousness on any level. Death is simply the opposite of life. However, one day, the dead will be awakened. For those who have died in Christ, death will be reversed when Jesus comes in the clouds of heaven (1 Thess. 4:16, 17). Jesus taught that the wicked will also be raised: “For the hour is coming in which all who are in the graves will hear His voice and come forth—those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of condemnation” (John 5:28, 29). The book of Revelation reveals that these two resurrections will be separated by a thousand years (Rev. 20:4–6).

The doctrine of an immortal soul that continues to exist after death without a body is a Greek concept that entered Christianity through syncretism. The Bible speaks of the final destruction of the lost; it does not teach that immortal souls will stay alive forever to suffer eternal torment. Scripture describes a fire that destroys everything and results in ashes. As an example of the final judgment, God turned “the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, [and] condemned them to destruction, making them an example to those who afterward would live ungodly” (2 Pet. 2:6). These ancient cities were destroyed by fire but are not still burning today. The false doctrine of an eternal hell puts God in a negative light and has caused many people to reject Christianity.

Many of those who were listening to Christ’s words believed that there was some kind of consciousness after death. Ellen White comments that “the Saviour knew of their ideas, and He framed His parable so as to inculcate important truths through these preconceived opinions.... He used the prevailing opinion to convey the idea He wished to make prominent to all—that no man is valued for his possessions; for all he has belongs to him only as lent by the Lord. A misuse of these gifts will place him below the poorest and most afflicted man who loves God and trusts in Him” (Christ’s Object Lessons [1900], 263). In other words, Jesus used their false beliefs about what happens after death to teach them a different lesson. The parable emphasizes that the decisions we make in this life cannot be reversed after death. There is no second chance. This life is the only time given to us in which we can prepare for eternity. Jesus used the parable as a call to consider the things that really matter in life before it is too late.
