In ancient times, people frequently hid their treasures in the earth. Without banks, the safest place to hide valuable possessions from thieves and robbers was often underground. Sometimes people forgot the place of concealment. Perhaps the owner died or was imprisoned or exiled, separating him from his treasure. In Jesus’ day, it was somewhat common to discover coins or even precious gold or silver in neglected fields.

Imagine the scene: while a man is plowing a field he leased from a local landowner, he suddenly hits something with his tool. He eagerly digs away the dirt and uncovers a treasure of great value, worth more than everything he owns. Now, the man in the parable is not the landowner but is merely leasing the land to grow his crops. Anything found on that land belongs to the landowner. At this point, the man knows exactly what he needs to do. After carefully concealing the treasure where he found it, he goes and sells all he possesses to buy the field. His neighbors, friends, and family think he has lost his mind. Why would you sell everything to buy an empty field? They see only the surface appearance. They don’t know something extremely valuable hides beneath the ground.

The hidden treasure illustrates the gospel. Once you come face to face with the good news about Jesus, you will see in Him a value that surpasses everything else in life. When you start pursuing Christ, your priorities will change, and people around you will notice. Because you’re seeking a treasure others haven’t seen, they might think you’re a bit crazy, just like the man in the parable. Some may think you are making a poor investment in life, but you know that obtaining the treasure of the gospel is worth everything. This parable is about discovering and appreciating the value of the gospel in the person of Jesus Christ, who is our ultimate Treasure.

The treasure buried in the field also illustrates the condition of the Jewish nation in Christ’s time. The field represents the Old Testament Scripture, which was available to all. However, erroneous traditions hindered the Jews from rightly understanding the prophecies about the coming Messiah. The religious leaders knew the text of Scripture by heart but failed to recognize Jesus for who He is. They had false expectations. It’s like they possessed the field and occupied it without discovering the treasure right beneath their feet.

Sadly, this application extends beyond the first-century Jews. Today, many Christians go through the rhythms and traditions of church without ever discovering the treasure and beauty of the gospel. Many young people leave the church because they see only an empty field, but God has something of far greater value beneath the surface waiting to be discovered and enjoyed.
