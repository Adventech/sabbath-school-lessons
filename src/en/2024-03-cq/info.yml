  title: "Stories That Transform"
  description: "Jesus Christ was no doubt the greatest teacher the world has ever known. He amazed and astonished people with His teachings. His words reached men and women of all ages; Jews and Gentiles alike flocked to hear Him speak. Both the rich and poor, the educated and uneducated, found something in His instructions that touched the deepest chords of their hearts. Jesus’ words have continued to impact generation after generation in the years since He left the world; the gospel accounts have inspired millions. This incredible fact is really no surprise since Christ’s words were carefully crafted in the very heart of God—a God of love, a God who spoke and it came to be, a God who created human beings and placed within them a longing for truth."
