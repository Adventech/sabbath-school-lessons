`How does life come from God’s Word, not bread?`

`What blessings has God given you that have been difficult to see as coming from Him?`

`How does our diligence and dedication interact with God’s blessings? In other words, if we sit around and do nothing, but pray a lot, will anything happen?`

`How can wealth be both a blessing and a curse?`

`How can we guard against ascribing our success to our own efforts?`

`How does God’s chastening produce fruit in our lives?`

`How have you seen God do whatever it takes in your own life to save you?`
