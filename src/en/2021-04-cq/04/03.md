Translating Deuteronomy 6:4 is challenging, as there is only one verb in Hebrew. The people are to hear/listen/obey, but there are many possibilities for the translating last half of the verse. Here are a few:

The Lord is our God, the Lord is one

The Lord is our God, the Lord alone

The Lord our God is one Lord

The Lord our God is the unique Lord

The Lord our God is the only Lord

When considering the immediate context, where loving God is to infiltrate every aspect of life and to eliminate the possibility of worshipping other gods, the second translation above seems most likely. While God is certainly one and unique and the only one, the point here is not His oneness or uniqueness, but the fact that He alone is God, and that He alone is our God. As His followers, we owe our allegiance to Him alone, and to no other.

When we love the Lord with all our heart and soul and strength, we are living life differently than we would otherwise, and this is also described as fearing the Lord. Fear in the Old Testament refers to a faith relationship with God. While this can involve terror sometimes (when we sin and realize we deserve the sentence of death), that terror is dissolved by Godâ€™s grace and provision for our sin, by bearing it on Himself! Loving comes first, and it leads to obedience.
