  title: "The Book of Deuteronomy"
  description: "The name Deuteronomy means “second law,” but the title in Hebrew is “these are the words.” The latter actually reflects the heart of the book, since it is not really law at all, but covenant. These are the words from God’s heart to yours. The words of Deuteronomy are timeless, and each succeeding generation is to live and remember as if they experienced the Exodus miracles themselves. As a covenant, Deuteronomy highlights first what God has done for His people, and then describes the loving obedience that the people are to respond with in gratitude. Three main themes of Deuteronomy are love, heart, and life."
