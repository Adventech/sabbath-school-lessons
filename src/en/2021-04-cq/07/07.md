`Have there been times in your life where you have struggled to give God your will? How did you ultimately make that choice?`

`How do you know if your heart needs to be circumcised?`

`What does it mean for us that God does not take a bribe or play favorites?`

`What is the relationship between God giving food and clothing to the foreigner and God’s call for us to love them?`
