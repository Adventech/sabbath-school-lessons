`What examples of injustice have you seen or experienced in your life?`

`How does it make you feel when you see the wicked go unpunished and the vulnerable/innocent suffer?`

`God’s justice is often thought to be contrary to love, but when you think about the injustice you have experienced and your desire for restitution, how does that change the picture of God’s justice?`

`In what ways can you act and speak differently in your own life to stand up for the vulnerable and oppressed?`

`What songs have been meaningful to you, either as a remembrance of what God has done for you or as a warning of the importance of following God with your whole heart?`

`How can we live to exhibit that God’s Word is our very life? What is a real result of that truth?`

`What is the significance of these being the last words of Moses?`
