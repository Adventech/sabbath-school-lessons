`How is Godâ€™s law clear in comparison to the laws of other nations and religions?`

`How does true love result in willing obedience?`

`How have you experienced redemptive punishment in your own life?`

`How have you experienced grace (undeserved favor) in your life, like Israel did in being brought back from exile by God?`

`How do you see the choice between death and life manifested in your own circumstances and decisions?`

`What difference does it make in your life to think about God rejoicing over you?`

`How can you inspire your friends and family to choose life?`
