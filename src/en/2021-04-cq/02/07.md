`Though we may think we do not have idols as graven images in our house, how else may we have an idol?`

`How do we know when we have an idol in our hearts?`

`How do you seek God with all your heart and soul?`

`How can God’s jealousy be a positive element?`

`How can we rejoice in the apparent paradox between God’s almighty power and consuming presence, and His compassion and tender-hearted love?`

`What are some promises that give you courage to return to God after you sin, trusting in His love and compassion, no matter your sin?`

`How has God shown compassion and mercy to you?`

`Where is your heart with God right now?`
