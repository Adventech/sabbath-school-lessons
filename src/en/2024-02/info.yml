  title: "The Great Controversy"
  description: "If asked, “What central theme runs through all the Bible?” how would you respond? Jesus? The plan of salvation? The Cross? Yes to all three, of course! But these three important topics unfold against another all-encompassing theme: the great controversy. This theme pervades the Bible, from the book of Genesis to the book of Revelation."
