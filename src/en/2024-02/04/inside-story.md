#### Tale of Two Neighbors

_By Andrew McChesney_

Mussa’s religion taught that it is wrong to raise pigs for sale. But Mussa worked as a pig farmer.

Nicolonaga’s religion taught that it is wrong to divorce for any reason except sexual immorality. But Nicolonaga married three times and, on top of that, had three common-law wives at different times.

The two men, who were neighbors, lived lives that were far from their professed religious beliefs. But God had a plan for them in Mozambique.

One day, one of Mussa’s pigs entered Nicolonaga’s vegetable garden and caused considerable damage.

Nicolonaga was furious and demanded a fistfight. He won the brawl, and Mussa limped away bloodied and battered. But Mussa did not intend to give up. He vowed revenge through witchcraft. “You have thirty days to prepare for your death,” he told Nicolonaga.

The next day, Nicolonaga woke up seriously ill. He spoke about Mussa’s threat to his friends from the Seventh-day Adventist church, where he had once worshipped.

As Nicolonaga’s condition steadily deteriorated, he grew worried. After 15 days, he asked church members to pray for him, and the pastor organized a prayer team to visit his house.

But Nicolonaga did not get better. Another week passed, and his options seemed few.

With the clock ticking down on Mussa’s 30-day deadline, the pastor called for a night of fasting and prayer for Nicolonaga.

Early the next morning, Mussa knocked on the door of the pastor’s house. He told a fantastic story about how his gods had fought with Nicolonaga’s God, and Nicolonaga’s God had won. He said he could no longer take Nicolonaga’s life. He wanted to become a Christian.

“I want to worship Nicolonaga’s God,” he said.

Nicolonaga recovered from his illness, and both he and Mussa joined an Adventist baptismal class. Both gave their hearts to Jesus in baptism. Today, both are powerful forces for good in their region of Mozambique.

“God is powerful, and He answers the prayers of those who seek Him in faith,” said Nelson A. Quenesse, the pastor.

After all, he said, “without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him” (Heb. 11:6, NKJV).
