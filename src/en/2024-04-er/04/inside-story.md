### A Powerful Prayer In Uzbekistan

_by Andrew McChesney_

An ambulance rushed 36-year-old Nigora to the hospital in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. Nigora could hardly talk. She had no feeling in her arms. She had trouble swallowing. The doctor didn’t know what was wrong with her.

Nigora got worse over the next month in the hospital. She couldn’t sleep for more than 15 minutes a day. X-rays showed that something was wrong with her brain.

Then a second doctor said Nigora was going to die. The doctor gave her no hope.

Nigora didn’t believe in Jesus. But Nigora had Seventh-day Adventist neighbors who believed in the Lord. The neighbors visited Nigora in the hospital. They asked her for permission to invite their church pastor to come and pray with her. Nigora said, “No, no! I’m not well. I look terrible. Tell your pastor to come when I feel better.”

But Nigora’s neighbors said, “Let the pastor come and pray for you.”

Nigora didn’t want to let the pastor visit her. But finally she agreed to let him come. A day later, the pastor and his wife came to Nigora’s bed. The pastor read Psalm 23. He put oil on the front part of Nigora’s face, between her eyes. Then the pastor prayed, “Lord, give health to our sister. Give her healing so she can be well.” Nigora didn’t feel any different after the prayer.

The next day, the pastor and his wife came back. Again, he read from the Bible. The pastor put oil on her and prayed. Again, Nigora didn’t feel any different. But that night, she slept for several hours.

The third day, the pastor and his wife came back. Again, the pastor read from the Bible. He put oil on Nigora and prayed. Again, Nigora didn’t feel any different. But that night, she slept the whole night. After that, she slept well every night.

The pastor and his wife continued to visit. Slowly, Nigora’s speech improved. Her arms and legs started to work again. Hospital X-rays showed that her brain was normal. The doctor was surprised.

The doctor said, “How is it possible for you to get better so fast?”

Four months after the pastor started to pray, Nigora could drive her car and went back to work.

Before Nigora got sick, she didn’t believe in God. But now she praises him for healing her. She says, “God worked a miracle to heal me.”

Nigora is glad she has neighbors who care about her. She says, “I’m grateful to God that He gave me these nice friends. They are the same as my family.”
