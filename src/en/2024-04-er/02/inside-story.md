### New Life In Colombia

_by Andrew McChesney_

Pablo never heard of Seventh-day Adventists. Pablo was a leader of the Sikuani people who lived in Colombia. Pablo was far away from his home when he was invited to worship God on the Sabbath.

Someone told Pablo, “This Saturday we will have a ­meeting.”

Pablo went to the morning meeting and saw that the people there studied the Bible. Cristian Camilo, a 25-year-old Bible worker, led the meeting. Pablo went back for the afternoon meeting, where many people asked questions about the Bible. Pablo was surprised that Cristian answered every question from the Bible.

When Pablo got a chance, he asked Cristian his own question. Pablo asked, “What do I need to do to become a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church?”

Cristian said, “We can start Bible studies.”

Cristian gave Pablo a set of 20 Bible lessons in the Sikuani language. Pablo was pleased and asked for lessons for the rest of his family.

Cristian gave Pablo a Bible and promised to travel to his community with lessons for his family.

As a Bible worker, Cristian was responsible for a big area in Colombia. Three months passed before Cristian visited Pablo. Cristian traveled with two Sikuani Adventists because he couldn’t find Pablo’s community without their help.

Pablo welcomed Cristian and announced that he finished studying the 20 Bible lessons. Pablo said he also gave Bible studies to his family and the rest of the community. 15 people were ready to be baptized.

Cristian arrived on a Friday. He spent the rest of the day answering questions about the Bible and deciding if people were ready to get baptized. When sundown came, Cristian led the evening worship program.

On Sabbath, Cristian led the community in worship. After the program, a man said, “There’s a lake nearby.” Another person said, “We want to be baptized right now!” That Sabbath, five people were baptized, including Pablo, his mother, Pablo’s two brothers, and one of his sisters-in-law.

Today, Pablo continues giving Bible studies to his people.

Cristian said, “There are many people, the same as Pablo, who are waiting for someone to tell them about Jesus.”
