### A Dream In Dallas

_by Andrew McChesney_

Samuel told the Bible worker on the phone that he wasn’t interested in Bible studies. The Bible worker was a member of the Dallas First Seventh-day Adventist Church in the state of Texas in the United States of America. The Bible worker said, “But you wrote that you were interested on a card we sent you.”

Samuel said, “Well, I’m not interested.”

A week later, another Bible worker called Samuel.

Samuel said, “I’m not interested.”

The next week, the Bible worker called again.

Samuel asked, “How much will Bible studies cost?”

The Bible worker said, “Nothing.”

At the first Bible study, Samuel said he and his wife were looking for a church. Their son invited them to his church. But the sermon about the seventh-day Sabbath and how it was changed upset them. Samuel said, “I’ll never visit another Seventh-day Adventist church again.”

The Bible worker prayed in his heart for help and continued the Bible study.

After several weeks, the Bible worker invited Samuel to meetings at the Dallas First Seventh-day Adventist Church. The Bible worker wondered if Samuel would accept the invitation. Samuel agreed to go.

At the first meeting, Samuel looked with interest around the church. The building was very beautiful. It also was different from most churches. The inside room where people worshiped was round. The ceiling was round, too. The church benches or seats curved around the platform at the front of the church. Samuel searched for the Bible worker and told him, “I need to talk to you!” The Bible worker was getting ready for the meeting that night. He asked Samuel to wait until the meeting was over. Samuel agreed and sat down. He listened to the preacher’s sermon about Daniel 2. After the sermon, Samuel found the Bible worker. He said, “I want to be baptized!” The Bible worker was surprised. He said, “What?!”

Samuel explained that he had a dream 18 years earlier. “In the dream, Jesus led me to a church. Jesus said, ‘This is My church.’ When I walked into the church this evening, I saw that I finally found the church in my dream. I want to be baptized.”

The Bible worker took Samuel to the preacher, Slavik Ostapenko, who also was surprised when he heard about the dream. What made the story so powerful was that the church burned down 13 years ago, and a new church was built. Samuel saw the new church in his dream five years before it was built! The preacher said, “Everything is possible when we cooperate with God in His work.”
