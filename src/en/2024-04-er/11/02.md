The Book of John begins with how life started. The Bible starts with this same story. “In the beginning God created [made] the sky and the earth” (Genesis 1:1, ICB). Or: In the beginning, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit made the sky and earth. Together, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are named the Godhead. The Godhead made everything. They made all the planets in outer space and all the people who live on them. On our planet, God made humans. God made humans for a special reason: God wanted us to live in love and peace with Him and with each other.

Sad to say, Lucifer brought sin to this planet. Sin breaks our relationship with God. So, Jesus became a human to help us understand God and to save us from sin.

While Jesus lived on this earth, He obeyed His Father and lived fully under His control. Jesus said, “ ‘My Father and I are one!’ ” (John 10:30, NLV). Jesus also said, “ ‘The Father is in me and I am in the Father’ ” (John 10:38, ERV), and “ ‘If I am not doing my Father’s work, then do not believe me’ ” (John 10:37, WE).
