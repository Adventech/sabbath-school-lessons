In the book of John, we read about many people who met Jesus. These people have different beliefs and expe­riences. Their stories tell us something important about Jesus.

Let’s look at what these people say about the Lord. John the Baptist: “ ‘Look, the Lamb of God!’ ” (John 1:36, ERV). Philip: “ ‘We have found the man that Moses wrote about in the law’ ” (John 1:45, ERV). Nathanael: “ ‘Teacher, you are the Son of God. You are the King of Israel’ ” (John 1:49, ERV). The Samaritan woman: “ ‘Can this be the Christ [the Savior]?’ ” (John 4:29, NLV). The Samaritans: “ ‘Now we believe because we heard him ourselves. We know now that he really is the one who will save the world [sinners]’ ” (John 4:42, ERV). Peter: “ ‘Lord, where would we go? You have the words that give eternal [everlasting] life’ ” (John 6:68, ERV). Martha: “ ‘Yes, Lord. I believe that you are the Christ [the Savior], the Son of God. You are the One who was coming to the world [to sinners]’ ” (John 11:27, ICB). A blind man: “ ‘I was blind, and now I can see’ ” (John 9:25, ERV). Pontius Pilate to the Jews: “ ‘See, your King!’ ” and “ ‘I do not find Him guilty’ ” (John 19:14, 6, NLV). Thomas: “ ‘My Lord and my God!’ ” (John 20:28, ERV). Who were these people? Why did they say these things about Jesus?
