### From Pin Trader To Camper

_by Andrew McChesney_

Jacob Pierce’s family loved to trade pins. They were excited to find new pins at the big Pathfinder meeting in the United States. At the meeting, Jacob’s mom saw a man with an Alaska pin. Mother knew Jacob loved Alaskan wildlife and nature. So, Mother tried to convince the man to trade her the pin.

The man said, “I can’t trade. This pin is special and only for pastors in Alaska.”

Mother asked, “What do you do in Alaska?”

The man introduced himself as Tobin Dodge. Tobin was in charge of Alaska Camps. Alaska Camps is a summer camping program of the Seventh-day Adventist Church for children ages 8 to 17.

Mother asked, “Could my son work there?”

Tobin said, “Yes, we train people to become camp super­visors when they are 16. We give them jobs when they’re 18.”

Jacob was excited about spending the summer in Alaska. He joined the camp as a helper. Jacob worked there for three years.

Jacob said that working at camp can be hard at times. One year, Jacob enjoyed spending time with an American Indian boy at Camp Polaris. Jacob and the boy both loved nature. They climbed Jackknife Mountain, which is near the camp. But the boy refused to behave. He also used bad words. Jacob thought the boy was more interested in false ideas than in learning about Bible truth. The boy blamed a rainy day on another boy who killed a spider. The Alaskan boy told Jacob, “If you kill a spider, rain starts falling.”

Jacob felt upset with the boy at times. But at the end of camp, the boy hugged Jacob and walked to his dad. When Jacob saw the two of them together, he started to understand the boy’s behavior. Jacob could see that the boy’s father was not a good parent.

Jacob, who is 20, said, “Most of the kids who come to Camp Polaris don’t have Christian parents or know anything about Christianity. So, when they come here, many of them learn about Jesus for the first time.”

Many of the kids who come to Camp Polaris have different problems from children at other summer camps in the Alaska Conference. The kids who come to Camp Polaris are almost all Alaskan Indians. These kids must fight against false beliefs, alcohol and drugs, and pain and suffering from their past lives.

Jacob says, “Being here is worth it. God really needs volunteers here.” Part of your 13th Sabbath Offering will help open a new center at the Adventist church in Bethel, Alaska. The Bethel church sends local children to Camp Polaris every year.
