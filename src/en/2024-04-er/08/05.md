Jesus said to the Jewish leaders: “ ‘You carefully study the Scriptures [Old Testament writings] because you think that they give you eternal [everlasting] life. Those [writings] are the same Scriptures that tell about me!’ ” (John 5:39, ICB).

Some Bible thinkers counted the number of Old Testament promises that Jesus kept. While the thinkers may disagree on the exact number of promises there are, they agree that Jesus kept hundreds of Old Testament promises.

These Bible promises are powerful proof about who the Savior was. The Old Testament told when Jesus would arrive, live, and die. Again and again, John uses these Old Testament promises to help readers understand why they should believe in Jesus and accept His mercy and forgiveness. These same promises help us believe in Jesus, too, and accept His offering for our sins.

**What do each of the following verses from the Book of John show us about Jesus as the One who kept all the Old Testament promises God made about the Savior?**

`John 12:13; Psalm 118:26`

`John 12:14, 15; Zechariah 9:9`

`John 13:18; Psalm 41:9`

`John 19:37; Zechariah 12:10; Zechariah 13:6`

`Is your faith strong? If someone asked you why you believe that Jesus is the Savior, how would you answer? How would you explain your faith, and why would you use that as proof?`
