### God’s Help Is Always On Time

_by Andrew McChesney_

Zurab was a Christian, but he was not very close to God in his heart. Zurab lived in the country of Georgia, which used to be part of the Soviet Union. Zurab had a Bible at home. But he only picked up the Bible to wipe off the dust from it.

Then Zurab started to wonder about being a Christian. He asked himself, “If I’m a Christian, why don’t I read the Bible?” He wished to read the Bible very much.

Zurab picked up the Bible and read it from start to finish. Zurab learned for the first time about the seventh-day Sabbath. Surprised, he looked online for more information. Zurab watched about 100 YouTube sermons and liked a preacher who explained the Bible very clearly. The preacher said he was a Seventh-day Adventist. The church had millions of members who kept the seventh-day Sabbath.

But Zurab didn’t want to join the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Many people in the country of Georgia believe that Adventists have strange religious beliefs. Zurab searched online for another church that worshiped on the seventh day and followed Bible truth. But Zurab didn’t find another church that did these things.

So, on a Sabbath morning, Zurab went to an Adventist church in Georgia’s capital, Tbilisi. Zurab stood outside. He wanted to go in, and at the same time, he felt afraid. Then the door opened, and someone invited him inside.

The church members gave Zurab a warm welcome. Someone asked him, “Is this your first visit to an Adventist church?”

Zurab said, “Yes, this is my first time.”

Someone else said, “Wonderful! Come to our meetings, too.”

The Bible meetings started that evening. Zurab went to church in the morning and to the Bible meetings in the evening. After that, he came every evening for the next two weeks. Then Zurab got baptized.

Today, a year later, 36-year-old Zurab has a new relationship with God. He reads the Bible daily and shares Bible truth with his family. His family also goes to church with him on Sabbaths. Zurab is amazed at how everything happened. First, he wished to read the Bible. Next, he learned about the Sabbath and found the online preacher. Then he went to the Adventist church on the same day as its first Bible meeting. Zurab didn’t go to church because of a special invitation or because he saw an ad for the meetings. But church members made him feel welcome and at home the first time he visited. Part of a 13th Sabbath Offering this year went to a health center in Georgia. Pray that God will bring people to the center, as He brought Zurab to church. Watch a short video about Zurab at https://bit.ly/Zurab-Georgia.
