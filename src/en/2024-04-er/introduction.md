### The Book of John

A beautiful Persian rug hung for sale in a shop in Tehran, Iran. On the rug someone had woven a beautiful picture of a forest in Switzerland, with mountains, a waterfall, a lake, and a blue sky filled with clouds.

Anyone who visited that shop could spend time inspecting how carefully the rug was woven. They could look closely at the fabric and the types of colors used to dye the rug.

Or the person could try to learn more about the carpet’s beauty: the snow on the mountains and the deep green forest. The colors of the carpet combined with one another to make a beautiful work of art.

This quarter we will be studying another work of art: the Book of John, as we read it in God’s Word, the Bible.

If we want to understand what God wants to say to us, we must study the Bible carefully. We must look at each verse, the chapters, the different parts of a book of the Bible, and the message of the Bible itself. The whole Bible came from the Holy Spirit. He showed men what to write. So, we need to study each verse of the Bible as part of the whole book to know what God wants to tell us.

This quarter, we will try to understand the message of the Book of John. John’s book is one of the four Gospel stories in the New Testament about the life of Jesus. The four Gospels are the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. John is different from the other three Gospel stories. What makes John’s Gospel so different? We read about personal conversations between Jesus and other people. These conversations include talks with Nathanael, Nicodemus, the woman at the well, the paralyzed man at the Pool of Bethesda, the man born blind, Lazarus and his sisters, Pilate, Peter, and Thomas. Many of these stories appear only in the Book of John.

The Book of John is the Word of God to us. God gives John this word to give to us. The whole Bible came to us from God, not just from human minds or thinking. John was God’s willing servant. The Holy Spirit gave many important ideas and topics to John to give to us. These topics include: Jesus the Word, light, bread, water, the Holy Spirit, being joined as one, miracles, stories, and special messages.

When we study the Bible, we often look at the meaning of a word or a few verses. We check the meaning of the word in a Bible dictionary. We examine the sentences. We look at what was happening in history when the writer wrote the verses. We can study the Bible almost the same way the people do who come to buy a beautiful Persian carpet in the rug shop. We can check the rug, its knots, the dyes, and the back of the rug. All these parts are important.

But we must not miss the big picture when we look at the small parts of a verse from the Bible. The Persian carpet is so beautiful that we can look at the mountains on it and feel we are in Switzerland. In the same way, the Book of John can make us feel that we are with Jesus during His time on earth. When we know Jesus, we have everlasting life. The small parts of the Book of John have an important job. They help us see and understand the big picture or impor­tant topic in the Book of John. That big picture is Jesus, our Lord and Savior.
