### “Please Stay”

_by Andrew McChesney_

At 8:00 p.m., an old married couple knocked on the door of the preacher’s house next to the Seventh-day Adventist church in Savoonga, Alaska. The summer sun shone bright in the sky. At that time of year, the sun didn’t set until 2:30 a.m.

The old married couple were in their mid-80s. The husband’s name was Eugene and his wife’s name was Marie. They didn’t wait for me to open the door. I was staying at the preacher’s house to collect stories for Adventist Mission magazine.

Marie asked me, “Are you a pastor?”

I shook my head no. Marie’s eyes filled with tears. She said. “Please stay. We need someone to keep the church open and to teach us.”

The church had closed several times since it was built in 1972. Pastors preached and lived there for a while. But for 20 years, the church had very few members left. Then, in 2010, the church opened again when two retired nurses arrived from North Carolina. The nurses were named Bill and Elouise Hawkes. They came to Alaska as Bible workers. Bill died in 2016, but Elouise stayed. Shortly after I came to visit, Elouise left because she was sick.

Marie missed Elouise very much. Marie told me how Elouise invited villagers to her home for meals and made packs of food for many of the Alaskan Indians. Marie said, “We need Elouise.”

I never met Elouise. She was very helpful when I emailed her about my trip. My respect grew for her as I heard about her love for the villagers.

My conversation with Marie ended at 9:00 p.m. Marie looked at me again and said, “Please stay. We need someone to teach us about God.”

Marie’s words helped me to imagine in my mind how Jesus felt during His work on earth. “He saw the crowds of people and felt sorry for them because they were worried and helpless. They were like sheep without a shepherd” (Matthew 9:36, ICB). I didn’t want to leave. I wanted to help these precious people in Savoonga and the other 200 Indian communities in Alaska. Only 11 of those communities have an Adventist church.

Jesus said to His followers, “ ‘There is much grain [crop] ready to gather [collect]. But the workmen are few. Pray then to the Lord Who is the Owner of the grain fields that He will send workmen to gather His grain’ ” (Matthew 9:37, 38, NLV).

Pray for Savoonga. Pray for Alaska. Thank you for your 13th Sabbath Offering this quarter that will help open a center to share God’s love with Indians in Bethel, Alaska.
