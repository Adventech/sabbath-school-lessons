> <p>Memory Verse</p>
> “Jesus answered, ‘I am the way, the truth, and the life. The only way to the Father is through [because of] me’ ” (John 14:6, ERV).

In the book of John, people often asked Jesus who He was. Jesus used the words “I AM” in His answer. These words showed that Jesus was God. The “I AM” appeared to Moses in the burning bush and said, “ ‘I AM WHO I AM’ ” (Exodus 3:14, ICB). Later, this same God “became human flesh [a man] and lived among us. We saw His shining-­greatness [glory]. This greatness is given only to a much-loved Son from His Father. He [the Son] was full of loving-favor [mercy and forgiveness] and truth” (John 1:14, NLV).

The “I AM” topic is an important idea in the Book of John. This week’s memory verse shows this important idea: ‘I am the way, the truth, and the life. The only way to the Father is through [because of] me’ ” (John 14:6, ERV). The “I AM” is the Light of this earth. He is the Bread of Life. He is the Gate or the Door for the sheep. He is the Good Shepherd and the True Vine.

This week, we continue to study more of the powerful proof John gives us to show that Jesus is God. Sad to say, many people didn’t accept Jesus as the Savior. We want to avoid making this same mistake ourselves. Also, we want to help other people who are in danger of making this same mistake, too.
