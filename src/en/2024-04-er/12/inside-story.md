### Kingston Feels Hope

_by Andrew McChesney_

Joy Anderson, a Bible worker, invited several people to the Seventh-day Adventist church in Bethel, Alaska. Joy wanted them to share their life stories. Part of the 13th Sabbath Offering for fourth quarter 2024 will go to repair the church and add a new center to it for Bible workers.

No one showed up at the church for the meeting. Joy brought some food on the way to the church from her office, where she works as a lawyer. Joy thought food would encourage people to come to the meeting. Joy helps lead the church with another Bible worker.

A little later, Kingston walked in. Kingston was surprised to see that he was the only person who came to the meeting. Kingston helped himself to some of the food, sat down, and talked about why he worshiped at the Seventh-day Adventist church in Bethel, Alaska.

Kingston is 59 years old. He works as a janitor. For years Kingston tried to stop drinking alcohol and taking drugs. At that time, Kingston lived in Hooper Bay. Hooper Bay is a town in an area named the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. 1,400 people live in Hooper Bay, a town that is a 90-minute plane trip from Bethel. Kingston said, “I wanted to get away from the bad life I was living. I told myself, ‘If I don’t learn from my mistakes, people will think I am stupid.’ ”

Then Kingston moved to Bethel, Alaska. In the past, many other people left their small towns in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta area and moved to Bethel. Bethel is the biggest com­munity in western Alaska. 85% of the people who live in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta are Alaskan Indians. Most of the Indians are from Yup’ik, Cup’ik, and Athabascan tribes or family groups.

After Kingston came to Bethel, he met Steve. Steve was also from the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. Steve was an Adventist, too. He invited Kingston to the Bethel church. Kingston said, “Steve asked me if I was sad or having trouble. I wanted to know where Steve worshiped, so I started coming to the Bethel church.”

Kingston felt strong when he spent time with other church members who also won the fight against drugs and alcohol. Kingston said, “These church members helped me to stay away from those things. The church helps me stay strong.” Kingston says that he is happy, but he continues to look for answers. “God is the Good Man up above. He sees everything. Somehow, He helps us find the answers we need.”

Pray for Kingston, who goes to church almost every Sabbath. Pray for him to choose to be baptized. Thank you for your 13th Sabbath Offering that will support Bethel church’s work this quarter.
