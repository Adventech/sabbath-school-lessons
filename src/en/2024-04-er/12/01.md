> <p>Memory Verse</p>
> “Pilate said, ‘So you are a king.’ Jesus answered, ‘You are right to say that I am a king. I was born for this [reason]: to tell people about the truth. That is why I came into the world [to this earth]. And everyone who belongs to the truth listens to me’ ” (John 18:37, ERV).

Jesus dies and wakes up from the dead. These two happenings are the most important part of the Book of John. John 1–10 talks about things that happen in Jesus’ life for 31/2 years. But John 11–20 talks about things in Jesus’ life that happen in one to two weeks.

Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John talk about Jesus’ death in different ways. Their stories about Jesus’ death agree. But the writers talk about Jesus’ death in ways that show the important themes in their books. Matthew and Mark talk about Old Testament promises about Jesus. Luke shows us how the cross saves us. Luke also tells the story about how Jesus saves the thief on the cross.

John shows how the cross honors Jesus and gives Him glory and praise. We may ask, how can Jesus’ ugly death on the cross also be a time of glory and praise? The cross was the most awful way for the Romans to kill someone, right? Yes, Jesus died in shame. At the same time, He is honored as our Savior.
