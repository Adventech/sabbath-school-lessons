The Book of John is divided into four parts: (1) The Beginning (John 1:1–18), (2) the Book About Miracles (John 1:19–12:50), (3) the Book About Glory (John 13:1–20:31), and (4) the End (John 21:1–25). So far, we have studied the Beginning and the Book About Miracles. These two parts of the Book of John tell us about Jesus’ miracles, conversations, and teachings. These things show us Jesus. Now our lesson will look at the third part of John: the Book About Glory.

As we saw already, Jesus compares Himself to seven different things that help explain who He is. These seven word pictures start with the words “I AM.” (1) Jesus says, “ ‘I AM the Bread of Life’ ” (John 6:35, 41, 48, 51). (2) Jesus is also the Light of this earth (John 8:12, John 9:5). (3) Jesus is the Door or the Gate (John 10:7, 9). (4) Jesus is the Good Shepherd (John 10:11, 14). (5) Jesus is the One who wakes up the dead (John 11:25). (6) Jesus is the Way, the Truth, and the Life (John 14:6). (7) Finally, Jesus is the Real Vine (John 15:1, 5).

This week, we will start our study with Jesus’ Goodbye Sermon. This sermon starts with Jesus washing His fol­lowers’ feet. Then we will look at the “I AM” word picture in John 14.
