`What question did Thomas ask Jesus about where He was going? How did Jesus answer? Read John 14:5, 6 for the answers.`

Thomas asks what we may think is a smart question. If you don’t know where someone is going, how can you know the way to follow that person? But Jesus shows that this question comes from a heart filled with doubt and not faith or wisdom. Jesus answers by saying that He Himself is the way. The way to what? Jesus is the way to the Father. In John 1:1–18, John helps us see the connection between Jesus and God the Father.

John 1:18 says that Jesus shows us the Father. The words “to show” come from the Greek word “exēgeomai,” which means “to explain” or “to make the meaning of an idea plain or clear.” Jesus explains the Father to sinners. So, Jesus is the Way to the Father. Without Jesus, we can’t understand the Father.

Philip asked to see the Father. No sinner can see the Father and live (compare with Exodus 33:17–34:9; John 1:18). Jesus scolds Philip’s misunderstanding and tells him that if you see Jesus, that is the same thing as seeing the Father. Without Jesus, the road to God grows dark and is no longer sure or clear. Jesus is the light that shows us the way to God.

Jesus connects three words together: way, truth, and life. The word “way” is used in John 1:23 and in John 14:6. In John 1:23, John, Jesus’ beloved follower, uses “way” to talk about how John the Baptist gets the way ready for Jesus. John also uses the words “truth” and “life.” These words are also important topics in the Book of John. Our study on Wednesday and Thursday will look at the idea of “truth.” The study of “truth” as a topic is very important today. That’s because people everywhere doubt what the Bible says about “truth.”
