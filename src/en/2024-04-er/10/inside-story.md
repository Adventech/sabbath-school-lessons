### Gift To A Colombian Woman

_by Andrew McChesney_

A woman drove her car into a parking garage in Bogota, Colombia. The parking garage belonged to the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The woman asked the parking garage worker if his church was Christian.

The worker’s name was Ruben Campos. Ruben was 52 years old. He told the woman, “Yes, we are Christian.”

The woman asked, “Which religion are you?”

Ruben answered, “We’re Seventh-day Adventists. Can we help you?”

The woman said, “Someone told me that Adventists don’t like to help other people.”

Ruben was surprised. He told the woman, “Let us help you. We’re ready to serve.”

The woman asked if she could park her car in the church parking garage. Her apartment was nearby, but it didn’t have any parking. The woman didn’t feel safe leaving her car on the street at night.

Ruben said, “Yes, you can park here.”

The woman asked, “How much does it cost?”

Ruben said, “It won’t cost you anything. It will be our gift.”

The woman was very happy. “Thank you!”

That night, the woman left her car in the parking garage. She came back to park in the garage the next night. On the third night, the woman asked Ruben for a Bible.

Then Ruben and the woman started to study the Bible. Ruben brought the woman a chair. He sat in his small office as they studied. After a month, the woman said she wanted to introduce Ruben to her husband. The woman called her husband from her cellphone. She told her husband, “I’ve been studying the Bible, and I want to be baptized.”

The woman’s husband was a top officer in the Colombian army. The army sent the officer to work in a foreign country. The officer told Ruben that he also wanted Bible studies. The officer said, “We can start when I get back to Colombia.”

Ruben was very happy when the woman got baptized in a Seventh-day Adventist church in Bogota. Now Ruben waits for her husband to come back to the country for Bible studies.

Jesus also served other people. Jesus said, “ ‘Do as I did: The Son of Man did not come for people to serve him. He came to serve others and to give his life to save many people’ ” (Matthew 20:28, ERV). Ruben wants to follow Jesus’ example.

Ruben says, “We can change many lives if we serve Jesus. Someone may come to you soon. You must be ready to serve at any time.” Thank you for your 13th Sabbath Offering that helped two Bible programs in Colombia last quarter.
