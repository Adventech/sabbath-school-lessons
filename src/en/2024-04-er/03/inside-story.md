### A Sabbath “Seed”

_by Andrew McChesney_

An American Indian man walked to the place where volunteers constructed a building. The volunteers put log walls on the foundation of the All Nations Center in the town of Wapato, Washington, USA.

The man said to the volunteers, “What are you guys building here?” Then the man asked, “Are you building another church? You guys don’t even know what day of the week to keep.”

The man in charge was named Jeff Weijohn. Jeff started a conversation with the man. The man never heard of Seventh-day Adventists before. So, the man thought the new church would be open for worship on Sunday. But the man believed that we should worship God on Saturday.

Jeff was surprised when he heard this information. Jeff never heard of a group of American Indians who had a history of keeping the Sabbath. Jeff talked with a history professor to learn more about this group of American Indians. The history professor explained that one or two groups of American Indians who lived on the Yakama Indian Reservation believed that the seventh day was God’s holy day. In the past, God planted a “seed” of Bible truth for the Sabbath in the hearts of these American Indians. So, they worshiped God on the seventh day.

Jeff and his wife, Terri, were excited when they heard this information. They wanted to share the Good News with more American Indians. So, in 1990, Jeff and Terri started a special program to work with the American Indians.

Jeff and Terri got help from a 13th Sabbath Offering to start their work. In 2001, they opened the All Nations Center. This center can be used for many things. People can come to the center to worship on Sabbath mornings. The center has a food area where meals are served. Each year, 300 to 400 people come to enjoy a special Mother’s Day meal. The center has a game area for playing sports. The center also offers day camps, Vacation Bible Schools, and after-school teaching.

Jeff said, “One reason we built this center was because the community didn’t have a place to meet.”

American Indians can also rent the center. One American Indian leader chose to rent the center for health meetings. He chose the center and not a casino. A casino is a place where people gamble. The leader said that gambling was destroying his people. Jeff said, “The leader wanted nothing to do with the casino.” The center is a big success. Now the SDA Church in other countries (including Canada) is opening their own centers for Indians.

Thanks for your 13th Sabbath Offerings in the past. Pray that God uses your offering to continue to change lives.
