In lesson 1, we started our study with the end of the Book of John. The end of the Book of John explains why John wrote His book. This week’s lesson goes back to the first chapter in the Book of John. In the first words or paragraphs of their books or letters, New Testament writers often tell us about the topics they will talk about. In the first chapter in his book, John also tells us what he is going to talk about. John’s topics include Bible truths about Jesus. These truths talk about a time before God made the skies and the earth.

These Bible truths help us readers to understand things about Jesus that the people in the story didn’t understand at the time. We can see important topics that John likes to talk about as he tells his story about Jesus.

This week’s lesson will start with the introduction to the Book of John (John 1:1–18). The introduction will give us a list of the most important topics that John will talk about in his book. Later this week, we will look at these topics again in other parts of John’s Gospel.
