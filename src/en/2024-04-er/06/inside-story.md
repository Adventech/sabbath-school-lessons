### “We Didn’t Send Anyone”

_by Andrew McChesney_

For four years, Donaldo Velasquez visited a Colombian prison every Friday morning to preach about Jesus. But one Friday, Donaldo couldn’t go. Donaldo worked as a carpenter. One of his customers needed his help. Donaldo also badly needed the money.

Only four Seventh-day Adventists had permission to visit the prison in Acacias. They were Donaldo, Ranses, Pedro, and the pastor. Donaldo called them on the phone for help. Ranses said, “No, I’m too busy.” Pedro also said he couldn’t go. The pastor apologized, saying he was out of town.

Donaldo cried and prayed. When his wife, Jesusita, asked Donaldo what was wrong, he said that he didn’t want to miss the meeting with the prisoners. But he needed to work. Jesusita said, “Go, do your job. God will provide for the prisoners.”

The next time Donaldo visited the prison, 38 inmates came to hear him preach. Pedro went to the prison with Donaldo.

One prisoner asked, “Where is the man who came to preach to us the last time?”

Donaldo answered, “We didn’t send anyone.”

Another prisoner said, “Yes, you did. A man preached to us.”

Donaldo said, “No, we didn’t send anyone.” He thought that maybe the man who preached was from a different church.

The prisoners said, “No, no. We know everyone who is allowed to visit us. This man never visited us before. He wasn’t from a different church.”

Donaldo asked about the man’s sermon. The prisoners said the man talked about the seventh-day Sabbath.

The prisoners told Donaldo that the man was tall and wore nice clothes, including a white shirt. The prisoners said the man knew the Bible so well that they thought he must be a teacher.

Pedro touched Donaldo’s arm. Pedro said, “An angel must have come and preached to them.”

Donaldo wasn’t convinced. He went to the prison guard. The guard was a friend of Donaldo’s. The guard checked the computer records of visitors to the prison. Then the guard shook his head. He said, “No one visited the prison that day.”

Donaldo was amazed. He said, “Now I know the Lord sent an angel to teach the Bible that day.”

Donaldo went back to the prisoners. He told them they saw an angel for sure. Six years later, almost all 38 prisoners gave their hearts to Jesus and were baptized. Donaldo said he will always remember that day. He says, “Yes, the story is amazing. But I believe God sent His angel that day.” Thank you for your 13th Sabbath Offering that helped God’s work in Colombia last quarter.
