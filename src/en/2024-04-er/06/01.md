> “ ‘And I am going to be lifted up from the earth. When I am, I will bring all people to myself’ ” (John 12:32, NIrV).

Jesus said some things about Himself that surprised people. Jesus talked about who He was, about who sent Him, and about where He came from. Jesus also did miracles and signs to show who He was. John writes, “Many of the people believed in Jesus. They said, ‘When the Christ comes, will he do more miracles than this man has done?’ ” (John 7:31, ICB).

Jesus’ actions were proof that He meant what He said.

As Jesus’ story continues, the people could not agree if He was the Savior. When Jesus heals the man at the pool of Bethesda, some of the Jewish leaders get angry. After Jesus feeds more than 5,000 people, the Jews argue about Him in Capernaum. When they finish arguing, large crowds of Jewish people reject Jesus. Later, Jesus wakes up Lazarus from the dead. Some people believe in Jesus because of this miracle. But other people feel hatred for Jesus. This hatred will cause them to put Jesus on trial and punish Him with death on the cross.

This week, we will look at the stories of some of the people who were witnesses for Jesus. In each story, we can see parts of who Jesus really is. Together, these stories help us to see Jesus, the Savior, more clearly.
