> <p>Memory Verse</p>
> “ ‘You carefully study the Scriptures [the Holy Writings from the Old Testament] because you think that they give you eternal [everlasting] life. Those [Holy Writings] are the same Scriptures that tell about me!’ ” (John 5:39, ICB).

The Book of John ends in the same way that the Book of Mark ends: with a meeting between Jesus and His followers in Galilee. This final lesson is about that meeting. We also will talk about how we know Jesus and the Bible. This idea is an important topic in the Book of John.

Jesus’ followers were with Him for more than three years. Again and again, Jesus told His followers what would happen to Him. But the followers weren’t really ready for Jesus to die or wake up from the dead.

Why weren’t the followers ready? They didn’t trust what Jesus said to them.

Today, we can be in danger of doing the same thing that the followers did. We may read the Bible, but we may think or feel that we don’t really need to obey it. We may not accept its spiritual truths as the light from heaven that should guide our behavior. Sad to say, too many Christians think and feel this way.

In our last week in John, we will look at some ideas that will help us know Jesus better. When we know Jesus better, we will want to live in Him and obey His teachings.
