### Success In A Village In Alaska

_by Andrew McChesney_

Pilot Jim Kincaid made his living flying from village to village in the state of Alaska in the United States of America. The villages were far away from the big cities. Taking off and landing was the easy part for Jim. Jim thought it was more difficult to find Alaskan Indians who wanted to hear and accept the Good News about Jesus.

Jim thought he was in trouble when he landed his small plane at a village about 150 miles north of the city of Fairbanks. Jim was flying Bible book sellers from village to village to sell Bibles and other Christian books. As Jim parked his plane, many people from the village drove out to meet him. Then they parked their trucks in a circle around his plane. The villagers did not welcome Jim.

One villager said to Jim, “Who are you?”

Another villager said, “What are you doing here?”

In that instant, Jim remembered a name of someone who lived in the village. The man from the village went to one or two meetings that Jim held in Fairbanks sometime earlier. Jim said to the villagers, “Is Robert Frank in town?”

When Jim said Robert Frank’s name, the people stopped looking angry. Then they became nice and helpful.

One villager asked Jim, “Oh, you know Robert Frank?”

Another villager told Jim, “We will take you to see him!”

The villagers took Jim to Robert.

Robert was eating when Jim arrived. Robert didn’t know who Jim was right away. Jim helped Robert remember how and why they knew each other. Then Robert remembered, and he was very nice to Jim. Robert offered Jim some food. Then the villagers welcomed Jim and the Bible book sellers into their village. Jim and the Bible book sellers had success because Jim remembered someone’s name.

Jesus also knows people’s names. Jesus said that He, the Good Shepherd, “ ‘calls his own sheep, using their names, and he leads them out’ ” (John 10:3, ERV).

Jesus knows our names. As His followers, shouldn’t we also follow His example and learn the names of people we are working with Him to save?

Jim said, “When you know someone in a village or his name, that information can help the whole village accept and trust you. That’s how it is in any village or community. If you remember someone’s name, you can win the hearts of the people.”

Part of this 13th Sabbath Offering will help to open a new center for Alaskan Indians in Bethel, Alaska. Thank you for planning to give a big offering this Sabbath.
