Read Ellen G. White, “At Jacob’s Well,” pages 183–195, in The Desire of Ages.

“As soon as the Samaritan woman found the Savior, she brought other people to Him. She was a better worker for Jesus than His own followers. The followers saw nothing in Samaria to show that it was a place filled with people that needed their help. They thought only about their important work in the future. The followers didn’t see that right around them were people who needed saving. The followers didn’t like the Samaritan woman. But Jesus used this woman to touch the hearts of a whole city. Because of this woman, the city came to hear the Savior. This woman carried the truth to her people right away.

“This woman is a symbol for how faith in Jesus works. Every true follower of Jesus is born into God’s kingdom as a worker for God. When we drink the living water, we become the same as a spring of water. Jesus gives to us so that we will give His blessings to other people. Jesus’ mercy in our hearts is the same as water coming up out of the desert. This water flows out of the earth to give life to everyone. Then those people who are ready to die and need the water of life will be ready to drink it.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, page 195, adapted.

**Discussion Questions**:

`What are some of the actions, beliefs, dislikes, hatreds, and behaviors, good or bad, that are not accepted in your community? Be very honest. How can these forbidden things get in the way of your sharing Jesus with other people?`

`The Samaritans welcomed Jesus so warmly and invited Him to stay in their city, while some of His own people didn’t welcome Him. Why do you think that is so?`

`Imagine in your mind that you are the Samaritan woman. A total stranger comes and tells you that He knows all your secrets. How can Jesus know things that nobody told Him? No wonder the woman felt amazed! What does her story teach us about how the Lord knows everything about us, including the secrets we don’t want anyone to know? What does this story say to us about the way God loves sinners?`
