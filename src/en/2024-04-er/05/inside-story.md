### A Book In The Mail

_by Andrew McChesney_

Rob Schetky was a retired U.S. Navy officer. He tried to read the Bible his whole life. But he had a hard time understanding what he read.

At one time, Rob didn’t believe in a personal God. Now Rob wanted to know God’s plan for his life. He got upset when people didn’t go to church and did everyday things on Sunday. Rob asked, “Why are you playing golf on Sunday?” But inside Rob wondered, “Where in the Bible did God change the Sabbath?”

Rob stopped going to church on Sunday. He looked for a new church in Fairbanks, Alaska, USA. Then a book arrived in his mailbox at the post office. The book was named The Great Controversy. Rob thought, “That’s an interesting name. I wonder what it means?”

Rob left the post office. He passed a stack of The Great Controversy books on a counter that other people didn’t want. Someone mailed the book out to everyone who had a mailbox at the post office.

At home, Rob started to read the book. He got excited as he read how man, not God, changed the day of worship from the Sabbath to Sunday. Rob thought, “Wow! Someone is telling the real history of the church.”

Rob contacted a friend. Rob said, “I’ve found a book about the history of Christianity. The book is named The Great Controversy.” Later, the friend called Rob back. “You’ve got to stop reading that book. It’s from the Seventh-day Adventist Church. They’re a crazy religious group! Stay away from them!”

Rob was surprised. He didn’t notice the name of the book’s author, Ellen White, or know that she was one of the people who started the Adventist Church. He said, “No, they’re not crazy. They believe in the Bible.”

After the conversation, Rob wondered if Adventists worshiped in Fairbanks. He found a church only 10 minutes away from his home. On Sabbath, Rob grabbed his Bible and The Great Controversy and went to church. The first person to greet Rob at church was a Sabbath School teacher named Helen. She was surprised when she learned that Rob came to church because of The Great Controversy. In the past, Helen complained that the small size of the words in the book made it hard to read. So, why should the church bother to give a copy of the book to anyone? But after a month, Rob already read more than half the book. Then he came to church to learn more Bible truth.

Today, seven years later, Rob is 70 and a church leader. He continues to read the Bible and Ellen G. White’s writings daily. He says, “When I found the Seventh-day Adventist Church, I found a home, and I found Bible truth.”
