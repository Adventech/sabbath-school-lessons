### A Scary Moment in a Camp Cabin

_by Andrew McChesney_

The eight Alaskan girls got ready for bed on their first night at Camp Polaris. Camp Polaris is a Seventh-day Adventist summer camp in the south of Alaska. The girls felt something strange and evil in the red wooden cabin. The two camp supervisors also felt that something strange and evil was in the cabin.

One camp supervisor was named Rachel. Rachel felt that evil angels were all around them. Rachel was 21. She was tired, but she couldn’t sleep. Rachel thought about the eight teenage girls in her cabin. In the past, adults hurt some of the girls. Then some of the girls hurt their own bodies. Other girls used drugs. One girl’s uncle was a witch doctor.

Rachel got up and put wood on the fire in a black stove. In August, the Alaskan summer nights were chilly. Rachel started to sing about Jesus. Rachel was a shy person. So, she didn’t like anyone to hear her sing. But the song came from her heart. As Rachel sang, she walked to each bunkbed and prayed with each girl. Finally, the girls fell asleep.

After that night, Rachel sang every night and prayed with the girls. During this time, Rachel asked a girl if she wanted Rachel to pray for anything special for her. The girl said, “Yes, I want to pray to feel safe and protected.”

Rachel asked, “Safe from what?”

The girl said that someone grabbed her neck the night before. The girl fought hard to breathe. Then a bright light appeared. The person who grabbed her neck let go of her. In the bright light, the girl saw an angel. The angel told her, “Don’t be afraid.” Peace filled the girl. She fell asleep. She didn’t tell anyone about what happened until she talked with Rachel.

After Rachel prayed with the girl, the girl wanted to know more about Jesus. The girl didn’t talk much because she was shy and quiet. But a “seed” for God was planted in the girl’s heart.

Rachel was happy when the girl came back to camp to become a camp supervisor a few years later.

Rachel Carle now teaches at an Adventist school in Sitka, Alaska. Rachel continues to volunteer at Camp Polaris.

Rachel says, “My time at Camp Polaris showed me that many people in the United States don’t know Jesus. My time working at this camp helped me to decide to become a teacher in Alaska.”
