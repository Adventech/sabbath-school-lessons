  title: "Renewing the Mind"
  description: "Life in our world has changed radically in the past few years. The coronavirus pandemic, riots, civil and political unrest, the erosion of the family, and the rise of natural disasters have many people experiencing fear, anxiety, and depression. Mental illness is at an all-time high. Teenage suicide rates are increasing. People are seeking peace and happiness wherever they think they might find it. Sadly, many are seeking in the wrong places and through debilitating avenues. Drug use is out of hand. Promiscuity is now accepted in many places. The happiness being pursued through money, entertainment, addictions, and technology often leads to greater unhappiness."
