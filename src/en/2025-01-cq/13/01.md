**Read This Week’s Passage: Isaiah 58**

**What Fills the Soul?**

People may have everything this world can offer, and yet they still live with a gnawing feeling that something’s missing. It’s the crisis of success—reaching the top of this world just to realize it doesn’t satisfy. The higher a person climbs in this world, the more this one question burns in their mind: “Now what?” These two words can make a person feel like the emptiest thing in the world.

Food may fill the stomach. Money may pay the expenses. Music may satisfy the ears. Entertainment may make us laugh. But what’s the point? Underneath it all is still a heart weighed down with sorrow (Prov. 14:13). No amount of music, partying, traveling, or posting online will fill the emptiness. Only God can satisfy the hunger of the soul (Ps. 107:9). This is not to say that God is the only thing we need (we still need to eat, sleep, and socialize, after all). Rather, God is our most central need. We should also recognize that many people try to fill the void in their hearts with religious routines that do nothing to heal them. It’s not religious rituals that satisfy the soul but a living connection with God.

Knowing that we need God more than anything else leads some people to abandon other forms of help that are needed for recovery and healing. You may be surprised in this week’s study at the comprehensive prescription the Bible gives for healing and happiness. We should be encouraged to know that God wants us to get all the help we need to succeed spiritually, mentally, and emotionally.
