The women who were the first to arrive at the tomb on Sunday morning (Mark 16:1, 2) were also the last to leave the cross on Friday (Mark 15:40). Mary was an affluent woman who had helped support Jesus and His disciples (Luke 8:1–3). In delivering her from unclean spirits, Jesus had given her a freedom that money could never buy. With Jesus in the tomb, she banded together with the other women to use their wealth to give Jesus a proper burial.

It was not a happy morning. Finding the tomb empty, Mary was convinced someone had stolen Jesus’ body (John 20:2). She ran to Peter and John, who came immediately to the tomb to confirm her report. Everyone was in a panic. Peter and John left the tomb and returned home, leaving Mary alone (v. 10).

The passage mentions four times that Mary kept weeping and weeping (11a, 11b, 13, 15). Her tears just kept flowing. Everything was behind those tears—it was grief, it was disappointment, it was confusion, devotion, and love. Heaven took notice of those tears. You would think seeing two angels clothed in white robes (v. 13) might shake her out of her daze, but tears still blurred her vision. Then she turned and saw Jesus, but did not yet recognize Him even as He asked, “Woman, why are you weeping?” (v. 15). Supposing Him to be the groundskeeper, she pleaded with Him to tell her where the body was and then offered to take it. Then, in a moment that changed her life forever, Jesus looked at her and said, “Mary!”

This was the moment Jesus was waiting for! He could have appeared earlier to Peter and John. He could have appeared first to Pilate, Caiaphas, or the Roman centurion. But no, this gift was for Mary. Jesus would not allow Mary to touch Him because He hadn’t yet ascended to His Father to receive the assurance that His sacrifice was accepted (v. 17). Eight days later, Jesus allowed Thomas to touch His resurrected body, meaning that sometime between talking to Mary and speaking with Thomas, Jesus did appear before His Father (v. 27). Imagine it! The Father waiting, all of heaven watching. Jesus putting the whole universe on hold to encourage one tearful disciple. Jesus appeared to Mary before He appeared before His Father. He delayed His trip to heaven and adjusted the whole calendar of heaven for Mary.

That’s the kind of love Jesus has for lonely, confused, and hurting people. Even now, Christ is ready to reorganize His work in heaven to send help at just the right moment.
