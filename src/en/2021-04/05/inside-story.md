Kim Hye-sun is a devout Christian in South Korea. She yearned for God and wanted to know more about His Word. So she joined a Bible study with friends but didn’t understand the discussion. She soon stopped attending.

Hye-sun usually drives a car, but one day she felt like taking the bus. As she waited at the bus stop in front of her house, she overheard two women talking enthusiastically. “Read this message!” one woman said, holding out her cell phone. “Someone sends me a message every day, and I love them!”

“Really?” the other woman said. “Let me see.”

Hye-sun found herself drawn to the women. “Can I see it too?” she asked. She didn’t usually talk to strangers, but she was curious.

On the cell phone, she read, “ ‘God is love’ is written upon every opening bud, upon every spire of springing grass. The lovely birds making the air vocal with their happy songs, the delicately tinted flowers in their perfection perfuming the air, the lofty trees of the forest with their rich foliage of living green—all testify to the tender, fatherly care of our God and to His desire to make His children happy” (Steps to Christ, p. 10).

Wow! Hye-sun thought, This is what I need!

She asked how she could receive the text messages. The woman with the cell phone promised to help. Soon she began receiving daily messages, and she expressed her gratitude by replying to each one. On Sundays, she texted back, “Have a good Lord’s day!” After some time, at her texted request for more information, she received The Great Controversy and other books in the mail. She has stopped sending Sunday greetings, but continues to express joy over the messages and is reading the books that she has received.

The text messages come from Lim Myung-Sook, a Seventh-day Adventist deaconess who sends Ellen White quotations daily to about 2,500 people, including leaders from other denominations. Myung-Sook is praying that Hye-sun and others who read the messages will grow closer to Jesus. “I don’t know how many people read these messages and how the messages are making a difference in their lives,” she said. “I am just a sower. But I believe God will make the seed grow and reap its fruits.”
