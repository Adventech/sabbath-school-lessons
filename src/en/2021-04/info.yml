  title: "Present Truth in Deuteronomy"
  description: "The story goes like this: during the reign of King Josiah in Jerusalem (640–609 b.c.), someone, probably working in the temple, found a copy of a book, and the book was read before King Josiah. “Now it happened, when the king heard the words of the Book of the Law, that he tore his clothes” (2 Kings 22:11, NKJV). Why?"
