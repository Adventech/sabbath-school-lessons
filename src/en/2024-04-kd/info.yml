  description: "In this issue of the Kindergarten Bible Study Guide you will find that the lessons are from the Creation story, and stories of Noah and Abraham. In these lessons the chil- dren will be introduced to three major themes—God’s grace as it is shown through His love for us; worshiping God by praising Him for His loving care; and loving one another as part of being in a community."
