`Why is it such great news that Jesus reveals thecharacter and the glory of the Father to us?`

`In what practical ways could a better understandingof Jesus enrich your relationship with God, the Father?`

`What should that tell us about how we should treatothers?`

`What is the importance of the eternal deity ofChrist?`

`What is lost if we believe that Jesus were somehow,in some way, a created being like us, but who went to the cross?`

`How is giving glory to God part of present truth andthe three angelsâ€™ messages?`

`How does this Christology impact our real-lifeexperience?`
