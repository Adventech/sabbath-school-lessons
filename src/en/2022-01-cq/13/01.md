**Read This Week’s Passage: Hebrews 13**

**One Another**

Hebrews 13 presents the apostle’s concluding admonition: “Let brotherly love continue” (Heb. 13:1). He has affirmed throughout the epistle that we are of the household of the King—the brothers and sisters of the High Priest Jesus. The author does not conceive of the audience only as a group of individuals who work on their salvation in a one-to-one relationship with Jesus, but as a family, or household, saved together. Paul has characterized the work of Jesus for us as “brotherly love”: He was “not ashamed to call them brothers” (Heb. 2:11, ESV). Thus, believers should do for one another what Jesus did for them.

Throughout the letter, brotherly love involved “exhorting one another” so that no one would fall short of the grace of God (Heb. 3:13; 10:24, 25; 12:15–17). In chapter 13 it involves numerous elements: hospitality (Heb. 13:2); visiting and supporting prisoners and those who have been mistreated (Heb. 13:3); honoring marriage (Heb. 13:4); avoiding covetousness (Heb. 13:5, 6); remembering and obeying the leaders of the church (Heb. 13:7–17); and praying for the author himself (Heb. 13:18, 19).
