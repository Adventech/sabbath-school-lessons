`Why is Jesus a Mediator of a better covenant?`

`How does obedience make manifest the reality of love?`

`If the closer we come to Christ, the more sinful we will appear in our own eyes, how do we not give up faith in despair?`

`How do Christ’s guarantee, surety, and better promises change your experience?`

`What does the law being written in our hearts look like for you?`

`How do we avoid legalism?`

`How do we avoid cheap grace?`

`How do we know if we are “balanced”?`
