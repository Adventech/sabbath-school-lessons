**Read This Week’s Passage: Hebrews 5:1–10 and 7:1–28**

**Bridging The Gulf**

The gulf that existed between God and us was caused by sin. The problem is by sin corrupting the natural world. God is holy, and sin cannot exist in His presence; so, our sin has separated us from God, just as two magnets in the wrong orientation repel each other. In addition, our sinful nature made it impossible for human beings to obey God’s law. Sin also involves misunderstanding. Human beings lost sight of the love and mercy of God and came to see Him as wrathful and demanding.

This week, we are going to study the amazing things the Father and the Son did to bridge that gulf. Hebrews 5–7 provides a careful analysis of Jesus’ priesthood. The author explains its origin and purpose (Heb. 5:1–10) and then exhorts readers not to disregard it (Heb. 5:11–6:8) but rather to hold fast to the assurance of hope it provides (Heb. 6:9–20). He also explains the characteristics of Jesus’ priesthood (Heb. 7:1–10) and its implications for God’s relationship to believers (Heb. 7:11–28). This week we will focus specifically on Hebrews 5:1–10 and Hebrews 7:1–28.
