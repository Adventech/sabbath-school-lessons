**Read This Week’s Passage: Hebrews 3–4**

**Perfect Rest**

Hebrews 1 and 2 focus on Jesus as the ruler and deliverer of God’s people. Hebrews 3 and 4 introduce Jesus as the One who provides rest for us. He is better than Joshua who was unable to give the perfect rest God had promised (Heb. 4:8).

Hebrews describes this rest as both a rest that comes from God and a Sabbath rest (Heb. 4:1–11). God made this rest, based on His creation of the world in six days and resting on the seventh day (Heb. 4:4), available to Adam and Eve. Their first Sabbath was an experience of perfection with the One who made that perfection possible. True Sabbath observance enables us to taste and experience to some extend the perfect fellowship with God we will have in heaven and the new earth.

When we keep the Sabbath, we remember that God made a perfect world in the beginning at creation and made perfect provision for our salvation through Jesus at the cross. True Sabbath observance, however, is more than an act of remembrance.
