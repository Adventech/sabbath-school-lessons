**Read This Week’s Passage: Hebrews 12:18–29**

**Kingdom Come**

Hebrews 12:18–29, the passage for this week, is the climax of the letter, and it sums up its main concern by repeating the idea with which it started: God has spoken to us in the person of His Son, and we need to pay careful attention to Him (Heb. 1:1, 2; 12:25). The description of Jesus in Hebrews 12:22–24 epitomizes the letter’s assertions about Him: Jesus is the Mediator of the new covenant, and His blood provides salvation for believers. His priestly and royal ministry in our behalf is a cause for celebration for the heavenly hosts. And finally, Hebrews 12:25–29 contains the last and climactic exhortation: God’s judgment is coming. It will bring destruction to His enemies, but vindication and a kingdom to His people (Heb. 12:28, 29).

The ending reaffirms the importance of Jesus’ achievements at the cross and directs believers to the consummation of Jesus’ victory. Paul uses imagery from Daniel 7 to remind the readers that Jesus has received a kingdom from God, the Judge (Dan. 7:9–14), and is going to share His kingdom with believers, “the saints of the Most High,” who will possess it forever and ever (Dan. 7:18).
