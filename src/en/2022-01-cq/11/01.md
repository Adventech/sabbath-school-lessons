**Read This Week’s Passage: Hebrews 11–12:17**

**The Race of Faith**

Hebrews 11 and 12 are probably the most-loved chapters of the book. They describe the Christian life as a race in which we all participate and in which all who stay faithful will receive the reward. They also describe the drama of redemption as a race in which people of faith from the past persevered, despite sufferings, but have not yet received the reward.

And that’s because the story ends with us as well, not just them. We are the concluding act. The drama culminates with our entering and running the last part of the race, and with Jesus seated at the goal line at the right hand of God. He provides inspiration as well as the ultimate example of how the race is run. He is the ultimate witness that the reward is true and that He is the forerunner who opens the way for us (Heb. 6:19, 20; 10:19–23).

Hebrews 11 explains that faith is confidence in God’s promises, even if we cannot see these promises yet. This lesson will explore what faith is and how it is obtained through the examples of the past but, especially and centrally, through the example of Jesus, “the founder and perfecter of our faith” (Heb. 12:2, ESV).
