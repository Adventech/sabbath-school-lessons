`What is the relationship between faith and understanding?`

`Why does faith often come before understanding?`

`If the Greek word pistis can mean both “faith” and “faithfulness,” why are both important in seeking to understand what living “by faith” means?`

`How did the people in Hebrews 11 show, by their faithfulness, the reality of their faith?`

`How can we do the same?`

`What role do we play, if any, in receiving and maintaining that gift of faith?`

`What did the “heroes” of Hebrews 11 do that exemplified their faith? How are their actions related to hope of things not seen?`

`Why is meditating on how God has led our lives in the past so crucial in maintaining our faith and trust in Him now?`

`What have you had to give up for faith? Why, ultimately, is the reward worth it, even if you can’t see it now?`

`Which character stands out to you in the hall of faith and why?`
