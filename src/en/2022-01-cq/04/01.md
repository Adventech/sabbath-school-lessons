**Read This Week’s Passage: Hebrews 2**

**Son Divine and Son Human**

Hebrews 1 talks of Jesus as the Son of God, the ruler over the angels, and “the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person” (Heb. 1:3, NKJV). In Hebrews 2, Jesus is the Son of Man, who was made lower than the angels and who adopted human nature with all its frailty, even to the point of death (Heb. 2:7).

In Hebrews 1, God says about Jesus: “You are My Son” (Heb. 1:5, NKJV). In Hebrews 2, Jesus refers to human children as His “brethren” (Heb. 2:12).

In Hebrews 1, the Father declares the Son’s divine sovereignty (Heb. 1:8–12). In Hebrews 2, the Son affirms His faithfulness to the Father (Heb. 2:13a).

In Hebrews 1, Jesus is the divine Lord, Creator, Sustainer, and Sovereign. In Hebrews 2, Jesus is the human high priest, merciful and faithful.

In summary, the description of Jesus as a faithful and merciful Brother is depicted in the description of the Son as the ultimate manifestation of the eternal creator God (Heb. 1:1–4).
