### Amazing Path to Lebanon

_by Kathie Lichtenwalter_

Ruan Oliveira was from Brazil. He served as a volunteer teacher at the Adventist Learning Center in Beirut, Lebanon. Ruan was part of a group of teachers who taught Syrian children in grades 1–8. These children came to Lebanon with their families to escape the war in Syria.

While Ruan was in Beirut, he went to an “I Will Go!” training class at Middle East University. The man teaching the class was Brian Manley. Ruan had a difficult time listening because he kept wondered, “Where have I seen this guy before?”

Brian Manley talked about how Paul made tents in non-Christian countries. Mr. Manley told about “modern Pauls” who used their skills to work in non-Christian countries today. While Mr. Manley talked, Ruan pulled out his cellphone and started to search through the pictures on his phone.

Ruan grew up in a family that served God. During high school, Ruan went with his parents to Argentina for an “I Will Go!” meeting, in 2017. The meeting touched Ruan’s heart. There, Ruan learned about the needs of people in the Middle East.

During Ruan’s first year at the university, he accepted an invitation to teach English in a non-Christian country in Asia. Soon after Ruan arrived in the country, the language school closed. Ruan stayed to study the local language. But Ruan was not allowed to talk about God to anyone. Some months later, Ruan went back to Brazil for his second year at the university. Then Ruan felt a strong wish to go overseas again. Ruan signed up online at VividFaith.com to be a teacher in the Middle East. VividFaith.com is the Seventh-day Adventist Church’s website for volunteers. Ruan wanted to serve in the Middle East since he learned about the needs of the people at the 2017 meetings in Argentina.

Ruan prayed, “God, the decision is Yours. I will accept the first job I get.” Seven minutes later, a message popped up on his phone. The message was a job offer from the Adventist Learning Center in Beirut. Ruan arrived at the school six weeks later. After Asia, Ruan was happy about the religious freedom in Lebanon. He said, “I can tell everyone here I am a Christian!”

When Brian Manley finished the meeting, Ruan said, “I know where I’ve seen you before!” Then Ruan showed Brian pictures on his phone. One of the photos showed Ruan’s parents with Brian at the 2017 meetings. At those meetings, Brian Manley’s talk about Paul and making tents touched Ruan’s heart. That’s when Ruan first wanted to serve God in the Middle East.

After a year in Lebanon, Ruan wants to finish college and become a full-time Bible worker overseas. He believes this work is God’s plan for his life. When Ruan saw Brian Manley again, he knew that God was showing him this special plan.
