> <p>Memory verse</p>
> “Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. In Christ, God has given us every spiritual blessing in heaven” (Ephesians 1:3, ERV).

On July 21, 1969, Astronaut Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. 25 years later, Armstrong wrote a thank-you note to the team who made the spacesuit he wore when he walked on the moon. Armstrong thanked the team at the Johnson Space Center for the suit that kept him alive during his moon walk.

Paul starts his letter to the Ephesians with a big thank-you note. In this note, Paul praises God for His many blessings. These blessings are necessary to the lives of Christians in the same way that a spacesuit is necessary for an astronaut who walks on the moon. Paul tells us that God has worked hard to give us His promised blessings for a long time (Ephesians 1:4). God has worked hard to keep His promises to us since He first made the skies and the earth. Paul praises God for working so hard to help His children all this time.

Paul’s opening to the letter of Ephesians shows us how to worship and praise God for the many blessings He gives us.
