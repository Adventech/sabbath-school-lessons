### Part 2: Safe in Jesus

_by Andrew McChesney_

16-year-old Almira decided to take a nap after school. Almira was tired from months of not getting enough sleep. So, she lay down on the couch. Her face was turned to the open door of the room. She was at home alone.

All of a sudden, Almira felt she was not alone. Almira looked at the door. She saw someone or something in the shape of a gray cloud standing in the doorway. Almira didn’t know why, but she understood that something terrible would happen if she blinked her eyes. So, she stared at the doorway for a long time, without blinking. Finally, she had to blink her eyes. In that second, the gray cloud rushed at her. Almira felt as if she was buried in a grave and covered with giant stones. She felt helpless, and she couldn’t move. Almira tried to breathe. She asked the good spirits for help. No one answered her.

At that instant, Almira remembered a prayer her parents taught her. Her parents were non-Christian. Almira said the prayer. For a moment, she was free and could breathe. But the spirit took her prisoner again. Almira said the prayer again and again. The spirit released her whenever she said the prayer, then grabbed her again when she stopped praying.

Almira grew so tired of fighting the spirit. She wondered what she could do to save herself. Just then, she remembered that one of the Russian teachers from the spirit classes said that Jesus Christ was more powerful than all good and evil spirits or magic. The thought came into her mind to ask Jesus for help. Almira opened her mouth to speak. She said only the first half of Jesus’ name. As soon as she did, the gray cloud ran away. Almira knew that Jesus entered the room and threw the evil spirit off her.

Almira knew she needed Jesus. But how could she find Him? Almira wasn’t a Christian. So, she went to her parents’ place of worship for two months. Then she started to sleep better. Almira decided that Jesus must also visit that place of worship.

Then Almira’s older sister, Faniya, came home with two friends that Almira never met before. Almira learned that Faniya started going to a Seventh-day Adventist Church near their apartment building. Faniya’s two friends were members of the Adventist Church. Almira told her story to the two girls.

“That evil spirit is from Satan,” one girl said.

The other girl said that Almira permitted Satan to enter her life when she started those classes. The girl said, “But Jesus is on your side. Only He can free you from Satan’s power.”
