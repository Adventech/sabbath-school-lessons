### Part 3: The Bible, a Mighty Weapon

_by Andrew McChesney_

That night, Almira woke up after having another bad dream. Almira decided to go to the Seventh-day Adventist Church the next Sabbath. But in the morning, she thought, “I’m not a Christian. I can’t go to that church.” The next night, Almira had another nightmare. She worried again about what she should do. On Sabbath, she went to the Adventist church.

After several weeks, Almira’s parents discovered that Almira was going to the Adventist church every Sabbath. Almira’s parents didn’t allow her to go. Other family members heard that Almira was going to church. They told her to stop going. Neighbors saw Almira walk to the church on Sabbaths. They came out of their apartment buildings to scold Almira. For Almira, going to church became a fight every Sabbath. But she enjoyed worshiping at the church. So, she kept going. She learned about Jesus and found peace in Him.

But at home the evil spirit continued to bother her. The spirit kept coming at night. Almira started to pray, “In the name of the blood of Jesus Christ, please, Father God, protect me from Satan so I can sleep.” Almira prayed the prayer every night for three months. The prayers sent the spirit away. But Almira continued to feel afraid.

Almira told the Adventist pastor about her fears. The pastor told Almira to read the Bible. Whenever she felt the spirit nearby, Almira opened her Bible to Isaiah 43. Almira loved the Bible promise, “Now this is what the Lord says. He created you, people of Jacob. He formed you, people of Israel. He says, ‘Don’t be afraid, because I have saved you. I have called you by name, and you are mine. When you pass through the waters, I will be with you. When you cross rivers, you will not drown. When you walk through fire, you will not be burned. The flames will not hurt you. This is because I, the Lord, am your God. I, the Holy One of Israel, am your Savior. I gave Egypt to pay for you. I gave Cush [Egypt] and Seba to make you mine. You are precious to me. I give you honor, and I love you. So I will give other people in your place. I will give other nations to save your life’ ” (Isaiah 43:1–4, ICB). Almira also felt comforted by Isaiah 49:24, 25.

One night, Almira confessed all her sins to Jesus. After that, she slept better than she had in a long time. Finally, Almira stopped being afraid. When she read the Bible and prayed, the spirit always left. Almira understood that the spirit was stronger than she was. But Jesus was stronger than the spirit.
