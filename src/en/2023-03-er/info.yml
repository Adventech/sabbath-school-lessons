  description: "In the letter to the Ephesians, Paul tells us about the experience of the Ephesian Christians. Paul writes to the Ephesians many years after the Christian religion came to the city of Ephesus. When Paul writes his letter to the Ephesians, they are in trouble. Many of them wonder if their faith is important to their lives in Ephesus."
