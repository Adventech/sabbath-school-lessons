### Visiting Prisoners in Spain

_by Gabriel Diaz_

I love to work with prisoners. Everywhere I served as a pastor, I also worked for God in prisons. I first started this work in Colombia, where I was born. Now I continue this work in Spain.

For the past 20 years, I visited four prisons in Spain. One of these prisons included a prison for women in the Spanish capital, Madrid. The prison has 400 women. I waited three years before I was given permission to enter this prison. For the first time, in 2019, I was allowed to enter. I led worship from 5:30 p.m. to 7 p.m. every Thursday. Only one woman showed up the first time. But she was very excited to be there and was willing to hear what I had to say.

I told the woman, “I’m very happy to meet you. I am filled with joy to come here. Let’s pray more people will join us.”

Together, we prayed that God would bring more people to our Thursday meetings. When I arrived at the 4th meeting, 10 women waited for me! Today, 60 women attend the meetings every week. The women who come to the meetings are as young as 22 and almost as old as 70. Our worship time is divided into three parts: (1) songs and prayer; (2) “Name Your Miracle,” which is personal story time, and (3) Bible study.

When I talk to the ladies, I always tell them to remember that God is their Father in heaven. I say, “God sees you as His daughters.”

In all the years I served as a pastor, I never saw worship and praise in a church as powerful as in the prisons. The women pray with all their hearts. They are so honest when they pray. Sometimes I wish my Sabbath meetings at church were as exciting as the Thursday meetings at the prison!

My time with the ladies is short. So, each woman writes her story about everything Jesus did for her before she comes to the meeting. Then the women bring their stories with them and give me what they wrote. Their letters are filled with praise about God changing lives. I have a big stack of letters now.

A group of church members also visits with the women and gives them Bible studies on weekends. A wall of glass separates the members from the prisoners. The church members aren’t allowed inside the prison. Only I am. But together, we are seeing many wonderful things happen. Several women gave their lives to Jesus. We also contacted their family members and are leading them to Jesus, too.
