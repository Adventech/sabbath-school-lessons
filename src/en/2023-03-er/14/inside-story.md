### Praising God for a Sickness

_by Andrew McChesney_

Anna was born in Riga, Latvia. From the time she was a little girl, Anna suffered a disease of the nerves. This sickness made Anna shake and tremble all over. The sickness changed how her brain worked and how she felt. Some days Anna felt that she couldn’t think. She wanted to be healed so much.

The summer after Anna finished high school, she went to a fortune teller who said she could heal people. But the fortune teller couldn’t heal Anna. So, the fortune teller told Anna about a customer who was healed by a pastor’s prayer. The fortune teller gave Anna the pastor’s phone number.

The fortune teller said, “The pastor will tell you about his church and God. But don’t listen to him. Just take the healing and leave. The rest of his words are a lie.”

Anna telephoned the pastor. During their conversation, Anna heard for the first time about the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Anna and the pastor decided to meet together.  At their second meeting, the pastor prayed for Anna to be healed. But her shaking sickness didn’t go away. Anna liked the pastor and accepted his invitation to study the Bible. Later Anna went to meetings at the church. Then Anna worshiped at church on Sabbath. She told her mother, “I think the Adventist Church is good.”

So, Anna’s mother went with her to church. A few months later, Anna went to church with both her parents. The next summer, Anna and her mother were baptized. A year later, Anna’s father was baptized and then her grandmother and brother.

Over the years, many people prayed for Anna. But the shaking sickness didn’t go away. Anna wondered why God didn’t heal her. Then she read about Paul. Paul also prayed for God to heal him. “But the Lord said, ‘My grace [mercy] is all you need’ ” (2 Corinthians 12:9, ERV).

Now 30 years old, Anna Rozenberga believes her shaking sickness is a big blessing. Because she must live with her sickness every day, she knows that she must trust God every day. Some Sabbath mornings, Anna doesn’t feel she can get out of bed. But then she remembers she must help out at church. So she trusts in God to help her to be strong. Anna’s sickness has helped her share God’s love. Her suffering has helped her to be patient with other people. She doesn’t always tell people about her sickness when she first meets them. But when she does, they open their hearts to her and are more ready to hear what she has to say about Jesus. Anna says, “My sickness has helped me share God’s love. So, I am thankful for my suffering.”

This quarter’s 13th Sabbath Offering will help support the work of the worldwide church in Europe, including Latvia. Thank you for planning to give a big offering this Sabbath.
