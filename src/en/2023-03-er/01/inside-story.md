### Bible Doesn’t Burn in Fire

_by Tor Tjeransen_

Valentina Melentjeva grew up in the city of Klaipeda when it was under the control of the Soviet Union. Klaipeda was the third-largest city in the country of Lithuania. Valentina’s mother was a Christian. But Valentina’s family didn’t own a Bible. They never talked about Jesus, and they never prayed.

When Valentina was 45, she saw that her neighbor Ira was happy during hard times. So, Valentina asked Ira the secret to her happiness. Then Ira invited Valentina to her home.

When Valentina arrived, Ira put an open Bible in her hands. For the first time in her life, Valentina held a Bible. The Bible was opened to Exodus 20. Valentina started reading the Ten Commandments. When she came to the 4th commandment, she was surprised to read God’s words to His people: “ ‘Remember the Day of Rest, to keep it holy. Six days you will do all your work. But the seventh day is a Day of Rest to the Lord your God. You, your son, your daughter, your male servant, your female servant, your cattle, or the traveler who stays with you, must not do any work on this day’ ” (Exodus 20:8–10, NLV).

Valentina read the Sabbath commandment four times. The seventh day, not Sunday, was the day of rest. Valentina worked on Saturdays her whole life. But now she wanted to live for God and obey the 4th commandment.

The next Saturday, Valentina went with Ira to worship with other Seventh-day Adventists in Klaipeda. On Valentina’s second Sabbath in church, someone gave her a new Bible in the Russian language. Valentina loved the Bible more than anything else she owned. A year later, in 2004, Valentina was baptized. Later, Valentina moved to Norway to learn more about God at an Adventist Bible school. When Valentina finished school, the cover on her beloved Bible was so worn it was falling off. So, Valentina paid someone to make a beautiful new cover for it.

In 2021, Valentina watched as her home in Kongsberg, Norway, burned to the ground. Her Bible was in the burning house. For sure, Valentina was sad to lose all her stuff. But the thought of losing her beloved Bible made Valentina sad most of all. Later, after the fire, Valentina’s son visited her and walked through what was left of her home. Valentina’s son came back holding Valentina’s Bible. Valentina was filled with joy. Valentina kept the Bible on a shelf with other spiritual books. The Bible was the only book the fire didn’t destroy. The fire hardly touched the book at all! Valentina said, “I am amazed by God’s love. He can save anything!”

Thank you for your 13th Sabbath Offering three years ago. This offering helped open a special center in Sortland, Norway, where people learn about Valentina’s favorite book, the Bible.
