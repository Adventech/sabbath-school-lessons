### Diapers on my Grocery List

_by Amy McHenry_

On Friday morning, I went shopping with my husband, Peter, at our local grocery store in Beirut, Lebanon. Peter went to buy apples and granola bars for the Pathfinders’ hike that weekend. Peter and I serve as Bible workers overseas. We teach life science at Middle East University.

I was looking for dish soap. I looked down the row where diapers were sold and saw someone shopping for diapers. I thought to myself how hard it must be for some people in Lebanon to get diapers. That’s because Lebanese money has lost more than 90% of its worth in two years. Goods cost so much money now. Everything keeps getting more expensive. More than 80% of the Lebanese people are now poor.

All of a sudden, I heard a command in my head. “Buy a pack of diapers.” I was surprised by this thought. I asked, “Lord, is that You? Why should I buy diapers? My youngest child is 10 years old!” I heard the command again. “Buy a pack of diapers.” I started to walk away. I said, “Lord, I don’t know anyone with a baby who needs diapers.” The command came into my thoughts again. “Buy a pack of diapers.”

I walked back to the row of diapers and prayed. “OK, Lord, I’ll buy the diapers. You’ll just have to show me later who they’re for. What size should I get?” I grabbed a pack of size 3 diapers and continued shopping.

When my husband and I met at the car, I said, “Don’t be surprised if you see a pack of diapers in the trunk. The Lord told me to buy them. They’re a gift. But I don’t know who they’re for right now.” We drove home.

The next day at church, I saw a friend whose wife works with families who have come to Beirut to escape the war against them in their home countries. I asked my friend, “Do you think your wife knows someone who needs diapers? The Lord told me to get some yesterday. I don’t know who God wanted me to buy them for.” My friend promised to ask his wife.

That evening, I got a text from my friend. He wrote, “When I told my wife your story about the diapers, she started to cry. Tomorrow she’ll be visiting two families who need diapers. May we pick up the diapers from you tonight?”

A short while later, I hugged my friend and handed her the diapers that God put on my grocery list. My friend told me that she works with more than 20 families who need diapers and can’t afford them. Now I put diapers on my grocery list more often.

Thank you for your offerings that help share the Good News about Jesus in the Middle East and around the globe.
