### Read for this week’s lesson
Ephesians 6:10–20; Romans 13:11–14; 1 Thessalonians 5:6–8; 2 Corinthians 10:3–6; Hebrews 12:4; Ephesians 1:21; Ephesians 3:10.

> <p>Memory verse</p>
> “ Finally, let the Lord make you strong. Depend on his mighty power [strength]. Put on all of God’s armor [battle suit]. Then you can remain [stay] strong against the devil’s evil plans” (Ephesians 6:10, 11, NIrV).

“The servant of Elisha got up early. When he went out, he saw an army with horses and chariots [war wagons] all around the city. The servant said to Elisha, ‘Oh, my master, what can we do?’ Elisha said, ‘Don’t be afraid. The army that fights for us is larger than the one against us.’

“Then Elisha prayed, ‘Lord, open my servant’s eyes. Let him see.’ The Lord opened the eyes of the young man. And he saw that the mountain was full of horses and chariots of [made from] fire all around Elisha” (2 Kings 6:15–17, ICB).

When Paul wrote Ephesians 6:10–20, he prayed that God would open the eyes of his readers the same as Elisha asked God to open his servant’s eyes. Paul asked God to help Christians understand the worldwide war between good and evil. When Paul’s readers understood this Bible truth, they would “see” the things God did to save them. Then Paul’s readers would have hope!
