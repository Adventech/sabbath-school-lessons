### Choosing the Best Words

_by Andrew McChesney_

Alexei Arushanian was a 33-year-old Ukrainian man living in Poland. Alexei was putting a new window in a customer’s apartment. The customer was a woman who liked to read about God. Alexei saw that she had a Bible and other religious books in her home.

Alexei belonged to a group from his church who gave people copies of Ellen G. White’s The Great Controversy. The work was hard because not many people liked to read. Alexei prayed for a chance to share a copy of the book with this woman.

The woman was about 40 years old and lived alone. She offered Alexei a cup of tea. Alexei sat and sipped the tea as the woman worked around her home. The woman sang as she worked. Alexei prayed about what to do.

Finally, he said, “I see that you love to read books.”

The woman answered, “Yes, I really love to read. You may have noticed that I don’t own a TV. I read all the time.”

The woman continued working and singing.

Alexei had an idea. He asked, “Are you a Christian?”

The woman nodded. “Yes, I sing in a church choir.”

Alexei smiled. “I also go to church. My church is located at Foksal 8.” He gave her the address of the only Seventh-day Adventist church in Poland’s capital, Warsaw. Alexei said, “I’m a Protestant. I belong to the Seventh-day Adventist Church.”

The woman was very interested. Her interest gave Alexei courage. He said, “I want to give you a gift. It is a very interesting book about the history of the Christian faith.”

The woman agreed to look at the book.

Alexei took his tools out to his car. He worried that the woman would refuse to open the door when he came back with the book. But the woman welcomed Alexei back in. Alexei saw that she liked the cover of the book. The woman opened the book and started to look through it. Alexei could tell from the look on her face that she didn’t agree with everything she read.

Alexei said, “It’s up to you to accept or reject the message in the book.”

The woman accepted the book. “Thank you very much.”

Alexei talked with the woman a little longer. When Alexei left, he was filled with joy. He was so happy that he found a way to give the woman the book. Alexei says, “I could have said nothing and not offered the book to her. She must decide to accept the book and its message or not. My job was only to offer the book to her.”

This quarter’s 13th Sabbath Offering will support the church’s work in Europe, which includes Poland. Thank you for planning to give a big offering.
