### A Book and a Ride

_by Andrew McChesney_

Alexei Arushanian was a 33-year-old Ukrainian man who lived in Poland. He earned his living by putting new windows into people’s homes. Alexei finished working for the day and was late for his appointment with his wife. Before Alexei met his wife, he needed to stop for gas first.

At the gas pump, Alexei saw a young man who was trying to start his scooter. A large black bag sat on the back of the scooter. The young man was on his way to deliver this bag of food to a customer’s house. Alexei couldn’t speak the Polish language very well. But he wanted to help the young man. As Alexi filled up his gas tank and then paid for his gas, he wondered how he could help the young man. Back in the car, Alexei opened the window and asked, “What’s wrong?”

The young man was Polish. He said, “My scooter won’t start.”

Alexei belonged to a group of church members who handed out copies of Ellen G. White’s The Great Controversy. Their job was hard, because not many people were interested in reading. But Alexei saw a chance to share a copy with the young man. Alexei got out of his car and said, “I have a gift for you. It’s a Christian book that teaches about the history of the Christian religion, from the time of the first Christians to the end times. I think you will enjoy it.”

The young man took the book and thanked Alexei. Alexei got into his car. But he didn’t drive away. He sat there and thought, “I can’t just leave. I haven’t done my duty as a Christian. Yes, I gave the young man a book. But I didn’t take care of his need.” Alexei opened the car door again. He said to the young man, “I can drive you where you need to go.”

The young man asked with surprise, “Really?”

Alexei said, “Really. I’ll take you.”

The young man grabbed the bag of food. Alexei drove him about 2 miles (3 kilometers) to the address. The young man asked Alexei, “Will you wait for me?”

Alexei said, “Of course. I brought you.”

On the way back to the gas station, the young man said, “In Poland, very few Christians stop and offer help. But you are a Ukrainian Christian and offered to help me.” The young man said his name was Kamil. Kamil listened with interest as Alexei told him about God’s love. At the gas station, a coworker from Kamil’s workplace arrived to fix the scooter. Kamil had help, so Alexei left. Alexei was late to his appointment to meet his wife. But he was happy God had used him to help someone in need.
