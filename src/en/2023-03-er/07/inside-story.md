### Part 4: A Real Offering?

_by Andrew McChesney_

For a whole year, Almira prayed and read the Bible every night to keep the evil spirit away from her. Almira also went to church every Sabbath. Her parents, family members, and neighbors said mean things to her because she went to church. Some of them said they would hurt Almira if she kept going. The rest of Almira’s life was the same as it was before she started going to church. Almira went to school on weekdays. She often went to parties and clubs with friends at nights and on the weekends.

At 18, Almira came to a difficult time in her Christian faith. She had a question she couldn’t answer. Why did the Bible say that Jesus’ death cost Him something? To Almira, Jesus’ death didn’t seem to cost Him anything at all. Yes, Jesus was nailed to the cross. But He knew He was going to wake up from the dead. So, why would He worry about death? When Almira compared her life to Jesus’ life, she thought about all she suffered. Almira gave up the love of her parents, friends, and family members for Jesus. Almira had no idea how her story would end. So, she believed she made a bigger offering than Jesus.

Confused, Almira prayed for an answer. She said, “Jesus, I have read that I need to tell You about my worries, and You will answer. Here’s my plan: I will read about Your life in the Bible, along with The Desire of Ages every day. Please show me what Your death on the cross really means.”

Almira didn’t really want to read the Bible or Ellen G. White’s The Desire of Ages. But she forced herself to read both books every day. At first, Almira was bored. She didn’t feel close to Jesus in her heart. She knew what her problem was. She worshiped on Sabbath, but she pleased herself during the week.

Finally, Almira found an answer. She read, “The Savior couldn’t see what would happen after He died. He had no hope that He would wake up from the grave. Jesus didn’t know that He won or that His Father accepted His offering. Jesus was afraid that God hated sin so much that He and God would be separated forever.”—The Desire of Ages, page 753, adapted.

Almira believed this quote was an answer to her prayer. Jesus also had been afraid. But He was ready to risk His life for her. Just as Jesus didn’t know how His story would end, Almira also didn’t know how her story would end. But Jesus gave His life for her anyway. Almira was surprised by Jesus’ love. She prayed, “Jesus, if no one else on earth follows You, I will follow You,” she said. Almira decided to give her life to Jesus and get baptized.
