### Part 1: Scared in Russia

_by Andrew McChesney_

Strange things started to happen at home after 16-year-old Almira signed up for a class on how to communicate with spirits and control them. Almira lived in the country of Bashkortostan. Bashkortostan is part of a group of countries known as Russia, which used to be part of the Soviet Union. In the Soviet Union, religion was not legal.

In 1991, the Soviet Union broke apart. At that time, the Russian people started to become interested in learning about religion. In 1992, two Russians from Moscow came to Almira’s school in the city of Sibay. These Russians offered to teach classes on how to know things without using our five senses. Our senses include sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste.

Almira’s parents refused to allow Almira to go to these classes.

The two Russian teachers promised to teach the children amazing secrets. One secret included how to heal people who were sick. For a long time, Almira’s mother suffered terrible headaches. Almira wanted to help her mother feel better. So, Almira went to the classes in secret. The two teachers taught Almira that good and evil forces were all around her. Almira could not see them. But if she learned to control these forces, she could use their power to do miracles.

When Almira was at home alone, she practiced the things she learned in the class. She started to talk to the spirits in her home. She told the spirits she wanted to control them.

That night, Almira turned off the light to go to bed. She then felt that someone or something was in the room with her.

After a while, something started to appear during the day when she was at home alone. Sometimes she saw a shadow run past her house window. Almira was not afraid. She thought she was strong and was learning how to control the spirits.

As time passed, Almira understood that the spirit was stronger than she was. So, Almira couldn’t control the spirit.

Now Almira was scared. She stopped turning off the lights when she went to bed at night. She was afraid to sleep. When she finally fell asleep, she had very bad dreams. Almira asked Mother to sleep next to her. Mother agreed but then stopped sleeping next to her daughter after a few days. Mother said she started having bad dreams, too.

For the next six months, Almira’s life was awful. She got bad grades in school. She fought with teachers, friends, and her parents all the time. Almira grew very afraid. She didn’t know what to do.
