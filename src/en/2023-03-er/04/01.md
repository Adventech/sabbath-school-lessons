Ephesians 2:1–10; Ephesians 5:6; 2 Timothy 1:7; Ephesians 1:3, 4.

> <p>Memory verse</p>
> “But God loves us deeply [so very much]. He is full of mercy. So, he gave us new life because of what Christ [Jesus] has done. He [God] gave us life even when we were dead in sin. God’s grace [mercy] has saved you” (Ephesians 2:4, 5, NIrV).

On October 14, 1987, 18-month-old Jessica McClure played in her aunt’s backyard. Then Jessica fell down an old well and got stuck 22 feet below ground. Her story in Midland, Texas, got worldwide attention on the news. People watched “Baby Jessica” sleep, cry, sing, and ask for her mother. People watched emergency workers send fresh air down the well to Jessica.

Finally, 58 hours later, people watched on TV as the workers released Jessica from the 8-inch-wide well that trapped her for more than two days. Photographer Scott Shaw took a picture of that special moment. Later, he won a prize for the picture. In the picture, we see the worried faces of the emergency workers as they look down at Baby Jessica, who is covered in bandages.

We like to read stories about people who save other people. In Ephesians 2:1–10, Paul tells us about the biggest and most exciting story of all time: how God saves humans. What makes this story more exciting is that we are not just watching someone else get saved. We are watching God save us.
