### Part 5: Healed By God

_by Andrew McChesney_

Almira told her parents about her decision to become a Seventh-day Adventist. Almira also told them about taking classes on spirits and magic. Almira told her parents about the evil spirit that visited her and about her bad dreams, too.

Mother cried. She told Almira, “If the church helps you, go.”

After Almira was baptized, she was never bothered by the evil spirit again.

Today, Almira H. Yalysheva, 46, is a language teacher at Zaoksky Adventist University in Russia. Her husband is Kemil K. Yalyshev. Almira met and married Kemil while studying at Zaoksky in the late 1990s. Kemil is a pastor and the vice president for student life at the university. Before Almira and Kemil worked at the university, they served for 10 years as Bible workers to non-Christian people in Russia’s North Caucasus area. Not long ago, the couple studied at the Adventist International Institute of Advanced Studies (AIIAS) in the Philippines.

Almira also is a mother. She has a rule at home. She doesn’t allow her children to watch any cartoons or read any books that talk about magic. After Almira’s own experience with evil spirits, she believes that the idea that there is good magic and bad magic is a lie. Almira says that all magic opens the door to Satan and his evil angels. Sometimes a parent will ask Almira, “What will my children talk about with their friends if they don’t watch cartoons?” Almira tells them that there are more interesting things to watch and talk about. If people choose to own screens or TVs in their homes, there are shows they can watch about animals and nature.

Almira’s sister, Faniya, is also an Adventist. Their father worshiped with them on Sabbath before He died. Their mother, now 75, reads the Bible and Ellen G. White’s writings. After Almira got baptized, she brought health magazines home from church. Mother read them. Slowly, Mother changed her lifestyle. She stopped drinking black tea and replaced it with fresh water. Mother also started to exercise. Soon her headaches went away. Almira’s wish to help her mother feel better was the reason Almira started studying about magic and spirits. But now God healed Mother. Almira says, “The decision to give myself to Jesus changed my life. Now I have the honor of being Jesus’ hands and feet. My biggest wish is to serve Him.”
