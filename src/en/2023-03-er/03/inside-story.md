### Three Books, One Answer

_by John Bradshaw_

When I was a child, I had lots of spiritual questions and no answers. Why did I need to confess my sins to a priest or spiritual leader? Why must I pray to saints or holy persons when I believed Jesus could hear my prayers? Will God burn people in hell forever? I liked going to church. I was happy to believe in Jesus. But I didn’t get answers to my questions when I went to church. So, I went to other Christian churches. Every church said they believed the Bible. But none of these churches answered my questions.

When I was 16, my older brother gave me a book. My brother joined another church that did something strange. The members worshiped on Saturdays. But I saw that my brother was happy. So, that made me think that the book he gave me was worth reading. I promised my brother to read the book. My brother said the book was about history and the end times. But I didn’t finish the introduction. Several years later, my brother asked me if I had read the book. I told him I had not. So, my brother gave me another copy. I promised to read this copy. This time I read most of page 1. Then I put the book down. I meant to read the rest of the book later. But I never got back to it.

More years passed. I left New Zealand, my home country, and went to England to live. On a trip to Ireland, I went to church. I wanted to know God so much. But as I stepped out of the church, I told God I was never going to church again “until You show me Bible truth!” When I got back to London, a package waited for me. Earlier I asked my brother if he had any idea about where I could find the book that he gave me twice already. I looked in several bookstores. But I couldn’t find a copy. In the package was the third copy of the book that was going to change my life forever. That book was The Great Controversy. This time I started reading in the middle of the book. When I got to the end, I went back to the beginning and read what I missed. I found the spiritual truth of God’s Word, the Bible, in this book. The Great Controversy explained the Bible’s special messages about the future. The book also connected me with Jesus. I found a Seventh-day Adventist church in London. That was the start of my real friendship with Jesus that continues to this day. No other book, except for the Bible, changed my life more than The Great Controversy changed me.

Help the Seventh-day Adventist Church in 2023 and 2024 to share copies of The Great Controversy with people worldwide. Visit https://greatcontroversyproject.org for more information or ask your pastor.
