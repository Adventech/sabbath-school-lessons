### A Few Powerful Words

_by Andrew McChesney_

Alexei Arushanian was from Ukraine. When war started in Ukraine in 2022, Alexei Arushanian was living safely across the border in Poland. Alexei worked for several years in Poland putting new windows into people’s homes. But Alexei had many family members in Ukraine, and he was worried about them. Alexei called his family members in Ukraine to make sure they were OK and to ask if they needed any help. He asked his aunt, “How are you, Aunt Lyuda?”

Lyuda said, “All is fine, praise God. We’re in hiding.”

Lyuda’s daughter Nastya and Nastya’s young son were planning on joining other Ukrainians who crossed the border into Poland. During normal times, this trip took only a day. But now the trip took two or three days.

Alexei asked his aunt, “Will Nastya and her son come to Warsaw? If they do, ask them to phone me. They can stay with me as long as they need. I can meet them at the border.” A short time later, another family member from Ukraine phoned Alexei to say that Nastya and her son already were in Poland. The two of them stayed with a Polish family. Many Polish people kindly offered to let Ukrainians stay in their homes.

Alexei promised Nastya to come for her and her son. Nastya and her son waited outside when Alexei drove to the house where they stayed. The owner of the house was a 60-year-old Polish man. The man walked with Nastya and her son to Alexei’s car. Nastya waved goodbye as she got into the car. Alexei opened the trunk to put her stuff and her son’s things inside. When the trunk lid opened, Alexei saw several copies of Ellen G. White’s book The Great Controversy inside. Alexei belonged to a church group that gave people copies of The Great Controversy. Not many people were interested in reading, so Alexei and the other members of his church group often had a hard time finding people to accept copies. Alexei grabbed a book. He handed it to the 60-year-old man and said, “I have a gift for you.”

The man asked, “What is this book about?”

Alexei said, “It’s a Christian book that talks about Christian history from the time of the first Christians to the end times. It is very interesting.”

The man accepted the book and hugged Alexei. Alexei was filled with joy. He never expected that giving someone a copy of The Great Controversy would be so easy.

Alexei says, “My giving this book to that man was God’s plan. I pray that he reads it and accepts the book’s message.”
