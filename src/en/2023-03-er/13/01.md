Ephesians 6:10–20; 1 Peter 4:1; 1 Peter 5:8; Romans 8:37–39; Luke 18:1–8.

> <p>Memory verse</p>
> “You believe in God. Take that [faith] and cover all of yourself with it. With that [faith] you can stop all the poison arrows of the devil. You have been saved. Wear your salvation [God’s plan to save sinners] like [the same as] you wear something on your head to protect yourself. And take with you the big knife or sword of the Spirit, which is the word [Bible] of God” (Ephesians 6:15, 16, WE).

John Bunyan wrote his book _The Pilgrim’s Progress_ while he was in jail. The book is a story about a man named Christian. In the story, Christian visits a special room in the palace where he is a guest. The room is filled with different weapons. These weapons are for the soldiers who are in the Lord’s army. Before Christian leaves the palace, he visits this room again and puts on a battle suit. This suit will protect Christian against future attacks during his journey to the Shining City.

Bunyan wrote _The Pilgrim’s Progress_ in 1678. 1,600 years earlier, Paul wrote his letter to the Ephesians. Paul, also, wrote from jail. In Ephesians, Paul says that God’s church is the same as an army. God has a battle suit for every member of His church to wear. This battle suit will keep us safe from head to toe as we share the gift of God’s peace with everyone on earth.
