Share insights from this week’s memory verse and Bible study as well as any discoveries, observations, and questions with your Sabbath School class (or Bible study group). Consider these discussion questions with the rest of the group.

`What are some examples of choices that lead to life versus choices that lead to death? (Deut. 30:15–19)`

`How can we reconcile the idea of God’s sovereignty with the idea of individual choice?`

`How do the consequences of our choices affect not only us but also our communities and future generations?`

`Is there such a thing as too much freedom?`

`Why is it impossible for God to offer His creatures eternity without His presence?`

`How have you seen God bless those who are committed to Him?`

`How can we explain why it often seems like those who don’t follow God are blessed more than those who serve Him?`

`How many of God’s blessings are for now, and how many of them are for the future?`
