Share insights from this week’s memory verse and Bible study as well as any discoveries, observations, and questions with your Sabbath School class (or Bible study group). Consider these discussion questions with the rest of the group.

`Why is keeping the Sabbath versus Sunday about so much more than just a day?`

`How should young people prepare for when the mark of the beast will be enforced?`

`Why shouldn’t we wait to engage in evangelism until the latter rain falls?`

`How can we learn faithfulness today, especially in the small things?`

`Have you seen church and state mingling in recent years?`

`Should those who honor God’s seventh-day Sabbath see themselves as spiritually superior to other Christians who do not? Why or why not?`

`How can we guard against feeling spiritually superior to those who keep Sunday instead of Sabbath?`

`What’s the Holy Spirit’s role in character transformation and evangelism?`

`What are some ways Jesus, His character, and the importance of a healthy relationship with Him be better integrated into our evangelistic preaching on prophecies?`

`How does the final contest reveal some of the core issues of the great controversy?`
