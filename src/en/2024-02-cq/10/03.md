When pro-democracy protests in Beijing reached a boiling point in June 1989, the Chinese government responded with a brutal military crackdown. Amid the ensuing chaos, one man whose identity remains unknown took a stand that has echoed through history. Armed with nothing but shopping bags, the Tank Man of Tiananmen Square, as he has since come to be known, positioned himself in front of a column of advancing tanks, refusing to let them pass. He even climbed onto the lead tank at one point, briefly conversing with the driver before returning to his defiant stance. This remarkable act of courage was captured in photographs and videos that quickly spread around the world. Despite facing a powerful regime determined to crush dissent, the Tank Man’s unwavering conviction in the face of overwhelming oppression has inspired countless others to stand up for their beliefs.

Throughout history, God’s faithful ones have always been in the minority. This small remnant has included Enoch, Noah, Abraham, the 7,000 in Elijah’s day, the 120 in the upper room during Pentecost, and other various groups throughout the last 2,000 years. Truth and faithfulness have never been popular with the masses, especially if they could cost one’s life. It’s no surprise that in these last days of earth’s history, when truth and falsehood come to a boiling point, God still has a group of remnant believers. Just as he has in the past, Satan has taken a special, sinister interest in them. He is angry and wants to crush the dissent: “And the dragon was enraged with the woman, and he went to make war with the rest of her offspring, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ” (Rev. 12:17, emphasis added).

Revelation 12:17 points out two identifying characteristics of this remnant: they offer grace-empowered, love-based obedience to God (see v. 11), and they receive a manifestation of prophetic testimonies and messages (cf. Rev. 19:10; 22:9). This small group of believers, armed with the faith of Jesus (see Rev. 14:12) and God’s truth, are called to position themselves spiritually before the advancing “tanks” of falsehood, sin, and Babylon in a courageous final protest. Under the banner of the three angels’ messages (see Rev. 14:6–12), they are to engage the world with unwavering conviction, inviting them into allegiance with Jesus Christ, the soon-returning Savior of the world and King of the universe.

The Seventh-day Adventist movement strives to fulfill the mission of God’s end-time remnant of believers who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus. Organized to facilitate global mission more effectively, its goals are clear even in the face of overwhelming odds: making disciples for Jesus and sharing the everlasting gospel of the three angels’ messages with the whole world in preparation for Christ’s soon return. Satan’s war against those who embrace this mission is relentless, and his methods are far too often successful: inspiring lukewarmness (see Rev. 3:14–21), infighting, polarization, theological and ecclesiological rabbit holes, reluctance in mission, and Christless preaching, among a myriad of others. All have limited the remnant’s influence in this world. There is hope even in the face of this great opposition, for the “sure word of prophecy” (2 Pet. 1:19, KJV) shows that the remnant church will be victorious in the end. The only question is this: will you be part of it today?
