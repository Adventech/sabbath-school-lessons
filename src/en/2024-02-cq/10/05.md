Malala Yousafzai, a young girl from Pakistan, emerged from unspeakable hardship as a beacon of hope and courage in the face of great adversity. At just eleven years old, she defied the Taliban’s oppressive restrictions on girls’ education by fearlessly writing a blog for BBC Urdu, inspiring countless others to believe in and fight for girls’ right to education. In an assassination attempt, Malala was shot in the head by a Taliban gunman while she was riding her school bus. The shot did not kill her immediately, and as she fought for her life, her story captured the hearts of millions worldwide.

Miraculously, Malala recovered and continued with her work, her testimony and unwavering dedication stronger than ever. She established a nonprofit organization to empower girls through education, and in 2014, at the age of seventeen, she became the youngest ever recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize—a testament to her incredible impact on the world. Her story demonstrates that even a single voice can rise above the darkest circumstances, inspire positive change, and ultimately achieve victory in the pursuit of a worthy cause.

As remnant believers, we have the worthiest cause of all: taking the gospel to “every nation, tribe, tongue, and people” (Rev. 14:6). We are called to be a beacon of hope, courage, and light in this dark world of confusion. Fearlessly and passionately, through love and acts of grace, we must proclaim the truth as it is in Jesus. People need to hear the good news that they can escape the oppressive restrictions of Satan and sin. They need to know “salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of His Christ have come, for the accuser... has been cast down” (Rev. 12:10). Satan is a defeated enemy!

Whether they’re conscious of it or not, every human being longs for wholeness, peace, freedom, healing, hope, and victory over all that sin has done. All of this and more is found in Christ. He gained the ultimate victory over sin through His death on the cross, and He sealed it with His resurrection. It is by faith in “the blood of the Lamb” (v. 11) that His victory becomes ours. God’s salvation is made possible only because Jesus died as our substitute. The blood of the Lamb reveals the indescribable love of God. Embracing His love provides the only means by which grace-empowered obedience is possible.

The great controversy involves supernatural beings and affects geopolitical, religious, and social movements, but it also shakes individuals to their very core. This personal experience of Christ’s triumph in our lives must not remain hidden. We must tell our stories! Our testimonies of victory and hope in Jesus must be shared far and wide (Rev. 12:11). Satan stands powerless in the light of the cross, and he loses his control over people when we testify of God’s faithfulness and victory. When we love God more than we love our lives, Christ is glorified and becomes irresistible to the honest seeker. Nothing is to keep us from sharing these things, not even the possibility of persecution and death.
