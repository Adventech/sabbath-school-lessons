  title: "The Great Controversy"
  description: "All human beings live by some metanarrative, worldview, or ideology that guides their perception of reality, and, consequently, their decision-making, ideas, and plans. Metanarratives influence how we interpret the events and world around us as well as the thoughts and feelings within us. They are the interpretive lenses through which we look to make sense of life. They affect our beliefs, values, and actions, provide a sense of continuity and coherence, link past, present, and future, and give life an orderly and somewhat predictable structure."
