`How does the parable of the wheat and the tares illustrate the great controversy between good and evil?`

`Why is Lucifer, not God, responsible for the origin of evil?`

`Why did God not destroy Satan at the beginning of his rebellion before he could do more harm?`

`Why does God allow bad people to exist among those who claim to follow a good God?`

`What can we learn about God’s character from the way He deals with sin and evil in the world?`

`How do we daily remain faithful to Jesus?`

`How can we trust in God’s ultimate victory over sin and evil even in the face of tragedies and problems?`
