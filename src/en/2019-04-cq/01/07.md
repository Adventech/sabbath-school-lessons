`In your prayer life are you seeking answers as diligently and daily as Nehemiah?`

`Why aren’t our prayers centered around “God’s,” “Yhou’s,” and “You’s,” but the “my’s,” “I’s,” and “mine’s” instead?`

`How can we place more care, concern, and investment into humanity as Nehemiah did for his people who were so far away?`

`What palatial luxuries are we encompassed with?`

`What is your life burden?`

`What is your life passion?`
