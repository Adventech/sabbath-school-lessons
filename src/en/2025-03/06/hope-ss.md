### Part #6 Deliverance Through The Red Sea

**Scripture Song:** Behold, bless the LORD – Psalm 134

Welcome to Hope Sabbath School—an in-depth interactive study of the Word of God. We are continuing a series of studies on the Book of Exodus: Stories of Deliverance. Today’s topic: DELIVERANCE THROUGH THE RED SEA.

- **Repentance or simply regret**
	- Exodus 12:31-36 Was Pharaoh finally repentant of his rebellious resistance to the will of the LORD or simply regretting the consequences of his rebellious spirit?
	- What other characters mentioned in the Scriptures experienced regret for the consequences of their rebellion against God but demonstrated no true repentance? (King Saul, Judas, Lucifer, etc.)
	- What good news do you find in the Scriptures for those who genuinely want to repent of their sin? Romans 2:4, Isaiah 1:18, 1 John 1:7-9, etc.
- **Consecration of the firstborn**
	- Exodus 13:1-2 Why did the LORD command that all the firstborn sons of the children of Israel should be dedicated to Him?
	- How does this command relate to parents today? Ephesians 6:4
	- What does it mean to you to be dedicated to the LORD?
- **Impossible deliverance**
	- How did the LORD demonstrate to the children of Israel that things impossible for us are possible with God? Exodus 13:17-22
	- What impossible situation did the children of Israel face and how did they respond? Exodus 14:1-11
	- Why did the children of Israel feel hopeless when facing the threat of imminent death? (remember the testimony of King Jehoshaphat—2 Chronicles 20:12)
	- Exodus 14:13-14 What words of comfort and hope did Moses share by faith with his people?
	- Exodus 14:15-31 What does the miraculous deliverance of the children of Israel teach us about the character of God?
- **The song of Moses and Miriam**
	- Exodus 15:1-11, 12-21 What themes are repeated in this song of deliverance?
	- While the vast majority of the redeemed never passed through the Red Sea with the children of Israel, what song can we all sing together as a song of deliverance? Revelation 15:3-4
	- What impossible situation have you faced in your life and what is your testimony of deliverance?
	- Someone watching Hope Sabbath School today is facing an impossible situation that only God can lead them through. What words of encouragement would you oﬀer to them?
