This week’s lesson is on the exodus from Egypt.

### ^[1. Pride destroys otherwise reasonable men (Sun)]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#F19637"}}})

- Because God predicted the hardening of Pharaoh’s heart, many assume he was destined (or pre-destined) to be lost (Ex. 4:21; 7:3; 14:4; Rom. 9:17, 18).
	- We know from elsewhere in Scripture, however, that Pharaoh hardened his own heart (1 Sam. 6:6).
		- The very implication is that Pharaoh’s heart didn’t start out hard, but became hardened as he resisted the Spirit of God.\
^[Satan's counterfeit [miracles through Pharaoh’s magicians] accomplished its purpose of emboldening the Egyptians in their rebellion and causing Pharaoh to harden his heart against conviction. PP 264.3]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#0070C0"}}})
- Thus his request for the blessing of God (Ex. 12:32) may have been at least in part genuine, but his pride gained the mastery of him.
	- We see this in Lucifer’s rebellion.\
^[Lucifer himself did not at first see whither he was drifting; he did not understand the real nature of his feelings. But as his dissatisfaction was proved to be without cause, Lucifer was convinced that he was in the wrong,… But pride forbade him to submit. GC 495.3]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#0070C0"}}})
	- This is the great danger for us all (Pr. 16:18). No one is immune.\

### ^[2. Faith alone obtains the victory (Mon-Wed)]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#F19637"}}})

- God had intentionally led His people into what looked like a no-win situation for two reasons:
	- To avoid the land of the Philistines (Ex. 13:17).
	- To lay a snare for Pharaoh (Ex. 14:3, 4).
- Genuine faith is ultimately trusting that God knows what He is doing (see Isa. 55:9).
	- This was affirmed by the words of Moses (see Ex. 14:13, 14).
	- God also provided two powerful evidences for their faith:
		- The pillar of fire and cloud (Ex. 14:19, 20).
		- The bones of Joseph (Gen. 50:24, 25; Ex. 13:19; Heb. 11:22). Joseph’s bones were buried in Shechem (Josh. 24:32; cf. Gen. 33:19; Ac. 7:15, 16; see Qtly, Tue, par 2).
- Works are the fruit of genuine faith (Jas. 2:17-20; Qtly, Mon, par 1).
	- The command to “Go Forward!” was a great test of faith for the Israelites.
^[The Hebrews had expected to obtain their freedom without any special trial of their faith or any real suffering or hardship. But they were not yet prepared for deliverance. They had little faith in God, and were unwilling patiently to endure their afflictions until He should see fit to work for them. Many were content to remain in bondage rather than meet the difficulties attending removal to a strange land; and the habits of some had become so much like those of the Egyptians that they preferred to dwell in Egypt. PP 260.2]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#0070C0"}}})

### ^[3. Victory is an experience (Thu)]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#F19637"}}})

- Only after they had crossed the Red Sea and witnessed the destruction of their enemies did Moses and the Israelites sing their song to the Lord (see Ex. 15:1f).
	- Their song of victory was a song of experience that could not have been learned in any other way. We find a perfect parallel in those facing the final crisis (see Rev. 15:2, 3).\
That song does not belong to the Jewish people alone. It points forward to the destruction of all the foes of righteousness and the final victory of the Israel of God. The prophet of Patmos beholds the white-robed multitude that have “gotten the victory,” standing on the “sea of glass mingled with fire,” having “the harps of God. And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb.” Revelation 15:2, 3. PP 289.1

### ^[Conclusion]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#0070C0"}}})

^[“The certainty of this redemptive act of God in history assures us that we have nothing to fear for the future. The last stanza focuses on future enemies who would be faced in conquest of Canaan. Because of God’s powerful ‘arm,’ they would be ‘as still as a stone’ (v. 16). When we face certain impossibilities, when we feel cornered and do not know which way to turn, we can find assurance in ‘The Song of Moses,’ for it commemorates a great event in the history of God’s people.” Andrews Commentary, p. 214 (Qtly, Fri, par 2)]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#0070C0"}}})
