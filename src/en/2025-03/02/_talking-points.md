> “And the Lord said: ‘I have surely seen the oppression of My people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows. So I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up from that land to a good and large land, to a land flowing with milk and honey.’” Exodus 3:7, 8, NKJV

### ^[Lesson Study Intro]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#0070C0"}}})

This week we study God’s call to Moses in Exodus chapters.

### ^[1. God keeps His promises and hears His people (Sun-Tue)]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#F19637"}}})

- God appeared to Moses in fulfillment of His covenant and in response to the outcry of “His people,” the Israelites. (Ex. 3:6, 7)
- Jesus spoke to Moses in the burning bush.
	- Just as God did His work of creation through Jesus (John 1:1-3; Col. 1:15-17), He does the same with His work of redemption.
	- This is the same Angel of the Lord that called to Abraham (Gen. 22:11-18) and Jacob (Gen. 31:11-13).
		- “This angel of the Lord not only speaks in the name of the Lord, but He is the Lord Himself. Jesus is God’s messenger to communicate the Father’s Word to us.” Qtly, Mon, par 2
- God’s use of the name “Yahweh” emphasizes His covenantal care.
	- In sharp contrast with Moses’s humble “Who am I?” (Ex. 3:11), God says of Himself, “I AM WHO I AM.” (Ex. 3:14) 
		- “His name, Yahweh, points to the fact that He is the personal God, the God of His people, the God of the covenant. He is a close, intimate God who intervenes in human affairs.” Qtly, Tue, par 4

### ^[2. Humility is good, but obstinance is not (Sun, Wed)]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#F19637"}}})

- Moses matured during his four decades in Midian.
	- He became a shepherd, started a family, and reflected deeply on God and the plan of redemption.\
^[The long years amid desert solitudes were not lost. Not only was Moses gaining a preparation for the great work before him, but during this time, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, he wrote the book of Genesis and also the book of Job, which would be read with the deepest interest by the people of God until the close of time. 3BC 1140]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#0070C0"}}})
- Moses was now patient and humble—almost to a fault.
	- “Who am I…?” (Ex. 3:11)
	- Who are you? (Ex. 3:13)
	- “Suppose they will not believe me…” (Ex 4:1)
	- “I am not eloquent.” (Ex. 4:10)
- After God addressed all of Moses’s valid, humble concerns, Moses moved to outright obstinance, thus angering the Lord (Ex. 4:13, 14).\
^[These excuses at first proceeded from humility and diffidence; but after the Lord had promised to remove all difficulties, and to give him final success, then any further shrinking back and complaining of his unfitness showed distrust of God. It implied a fear that God was unable to qualify him for the great work to which He had called him, or that He had made a mistake in the selection of the man.  PP 254.2]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#0070C0"}}})

### ^[3. Obedience is a condition of salvation (Thu)]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#F19637"}}})

- On the way to Egypt, the Lord almost killed Moses! (Ex. 4:24-26)
	- The apparently willful neglect to circumcise his son placed Moses outside the protection of angels.\
^[In his mission to Pharaoh, Moses was to be placed in a position of great peril; his life could be preserved only through the protection of holy angels. But while living in neglect of a known duty, he would not be secure; for he could not be shielded by the angels of God. PP 255]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#0070C0"}}})
- Thus, while obedience certainly is not the cause of our salvation, it is certainly a condition of it.

### ^[Conclusion]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#0070C0"}}})

^[The divine command given to Moses found him self-distrustful, slow of speech, and timid. He was overwhelmed with a sense of his incapacity to be a mouthpiece for God to Israel. But having once accepted the work, he entered upon it with his whole heart, putting all his trust in the Lord. The greatness of his mission called into exercise the best powers of his mind. God blessed his ready obedience, and he became eloquent, hopeful, self-possessed, and well fitted for the greatest work ever given to man. This is an example of what God does to strengthen the character of those who trust Him fully and give themselves unreservedly to His commands. PP 255]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#0070C0"}}})
