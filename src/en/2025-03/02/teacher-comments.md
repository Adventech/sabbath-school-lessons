#### Part I: Overview

Key Text: Exodus 3:7, 8

Study Focus: Exod. 3:1–4:31

Introduction: God revealed Himself to Moses, calling him to be His servant who would deliver His people from Egypt and lead them to the Promised Land. Moses is overwhelmed with this new task and asks God to choose someone else.

**Lesson Themes**

In our study of Exodus 3 and 4, let us underline one crucial fact: When God calls His people to do a specific task, He also equips and enables them to do it. Calling and empowering go hand in hand. The Lord gives needed spiritual gifts and skills. We do not need to worry, even though the work can be enormous and far beyond our abilities. God is in charge. We need to let God be God in our lives and completely rely on His promises. We can trust Him. It is our responsibility to follow His lead and obey.

The structure of these two chapters, dealing with God’s intervention in favor of His people, may be divided into four principal parts:

A.	God’s meeting with Moses (Exod. 3:1–4:17), which has an introduction and commission (Exod. 3:1–10) and four sections dealing with the dialogue between the Lord and Moses: (1) Exodus 3:11, 12; (2) Exodus 3:13–22; (3) Exodus 4:1–9; and (4) Exodus 4:10–12, as well as an epilogue: Moses’ last plea, God’s anger, and His sending Aaron to Moses for support (Exod. 4:13–17).

B.	Moses’ return to Egypt, with his wife and two sons, and God’s as­surance to Moses of His help (Exod. 4:18–23).

C.	Problem with circumcision (Exod. 4:24–26).

D.	Moses’ meetings with Aaron, the elders, and, finally, with the Israelites (Exod. 4:27–31).

Great and mighty acts of God are anticipated. God’s people believe and worship the living God who will work for their redemption.

#### Part II: Commentary

The most transformative event in Moses’ life was his personal encounter with the Lord during the burning bush experience. This incident dramatically altered his life. At the time of the event, he was 80 years old, and he lived a fulfilling, stable, and well-adjusted life. He was married, had two sons, lived in Midian, and was useful to the Lord. In his quiet time, while taking care of sheep, he was inspired by God to write two biblical books: Job and Genesis. Clearly, Moses was satisfied with his family life and walk with the Lord. Then comes a shocking disturbance to his peaceful routine of everyday life: Moses sees a burning bush that is not consumed by the flames that engulf it.

When the Lord caught Moses’ attention, He told him how concerned He was with the Israelites’ situation in Egypt. God spoke about their misery, oppression, slavery, crying out for help, and suffering. “I have come down to rescue them” (Exod. 3:8, NIV), the Lord declared. He called the Israelites “my people” (Exod. 3:10) and wanted to lead His people to a new land. We call it the Promised Land because God gave His word to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that their descendants would inherit Canaan. The time had come for God to act, and Moses would be the instrument through whom He would fulfill His promise.

Moses was called by God Himself to go back to Egypt, a land from which he fled in order to save his own life 40 years previously (in 1490 B.C.). Moses was now to meet with Pharaoh Thutmose III (1504–1450 B.C.), whom he personally knew from the time when he grew up and lived in the king’s palace. Moses’ adoptive mother, Hatshepsut, had died in 1482 B.C. When God asked Moses to go back and work with Him to deliver the Israelites from Egypt, He gave two commands to Moses: “ ‘So now, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt’ ” (Exod. 3:10, NIV). From this verse, we may observe that God used two imperatives that are not as clear in our modern translations. God told Moses emphatically: (1) “ ‘Go!’ ”; and (2) “ ‘Bring my people . . . out of Egypt.’ ” The drama of Moses’ calling thus unfolded.

**Moses’ Four Excuses and God’s Four Promises**

Moses’ Four Excuses and God’s Four Promises

1\. “ ‘Who Am I?’ ” versus “ ‘I Will Be With You’ ” (Exod. 3:11, 12)

When Moses hears these two commands (“Go!” and “ ‘Bring my people out of Egypt’ ” (NIV), he is initially unwilling to submit and conform to them. Moses employs four strategies to relieve himself of the enormous burden of this commission. First, he hides behind his humility and asks an excellent question: “ ‘Who am I?’ ” It is important to know our insufficiency and inability to do what God requires us to perform. The power to follow His leadership is not in us but outside of us; it is in God’s equipping us when we humbly follow Him. However, Moses goes beyond this recognition to seek his way out of the divine charge.

God, in response, assures Moses that He will be with him (the same phrase “ ‘I will be’ ” is used in verses 12 and 14), and gives him a sign by stating that Moses and the Israelites will worship God on this very mountain, Mount Sinai, upon which they now meet. This promise is all-inclusive. Everything needed is included in God’s presence with His people. The “Immanuel” motif (“God with us”) is the most important promise.

2\. “What Is Your Name?” versus “ ‘I AM WHO I AM’ ” (Exod. 3:13–22, NIV)

Moses tenders his second excuse by asking for the meaning of God’s name YHWH: “What is Your Name?” This time he is hiding behind the ignorance of God’s people, rightly claiming that they do not know God personally; thus, how will they be able to know Moses is God’s appointed leader?

The Lord patiently explains that He is eternal, personal, and the real God. He is the God of history who led Israel’s forefathers. He is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God who communicated with them and took care of them in His love and mercy. He is the God who gave them His promise that He would bring them to “a land flowing with milk and honey” (Exod. 3:17), with God’s abundant blessings. He is the Lord. The God of the Hebrews. God gave them the promise that when they left Egypt, they would not go empty-handed but with many precious gifts that had been withheld from them during the time when they were enslaved.

3\. “ ‘What If They Do Not Believe Me Or Listen?’ ” (NIV) versus Mighty Signs of God (Exod. 4:1–9)

Moses continues with his third objection by pointing to the hesitancy of the Israelites: “Suppose that they will not listen and believe me? What then?” In response, God tells him that He will enable him to perform two miracles that will be tangible signs and evidence that God has sent him and will deliver His people from Egypt: (1) Moses will be able to change his staff into a snake and back into a staff; and (2) he will put his hand into his bosom, take it out leprous, then return it to be healed.

4\. “I Am Not Eloquent” (Exod. 4:10, ESV) versus “I Will Help You Speak” (Exod. 4:12, NIV)

Moses’ fourth pretext for not going to Egypt is simple: “I am not a good speaker. I have never been eloquent.” Moses is pleading with the Lord that he is slow in formulating arguments and is not fluent in the Egyptian and Hebrew languages.

Understandably, he has not used the Egyptian language for four decades. God, in response, assures Moses that He will give him the ability to express things persuasively and articulately because He is the Creator. As such, God will, thus, empower Moses for this task: “ ‘I will help you speak [literally, I will be with your mouth] and teach you what to say’ ” (Exod. 4:12, NIV). (This promise reminds us of a similar story in Jeremiah 1:5–8.)

Exodus 4:13–17 describes Moses’ final excuse and God’s reaction to it. Moses is cornered. All his excuses were powerfully refuted by God Himself. What will Moses do? He must clearly define his position by answering God’s call, either with a yes or a no. To our shock, Moses refuses to follow God’s orders, even after receiving exceptional promises from God. Moses is not willing to go: “ ‘Please send someone else’ ” (Exod. 4:13, NIV).

Now the roles are reversed. Moses not only rejects God’s imperatives, but he dares to command God with his own imperative, even though he softens it with the word please:

“ ‘Please send someone else.’ ” The one who should obey gives directives to God instead. What a contradiction!

At this moment, the biblical text states that “the Lord’s anger burned against Moses” (Exod. 4:14, NIV). Yet, God presents a solution: it will be in the person of Aaron, Moses’ brother, who “ ‘is already on his way to meet you’ ” (Exod. 4:14, NIV). God knew Moses’ negative answer in advance and had already sent Aaron to Moses to encourage them to work together to fulfill God’s commission. Aaron will be Moses’ “mouth,” i.e., his spokesperson who will communicate God’s word to Pharaoh and the people. What a loving and gracious Lord! He provides a solution where we see only darkness.

With great hesitancy, Moses follows God’s instructions. We do not read of Moses’ answer to the divine solution, but we discover, in the following verses, that Moses goes to Egypt. As a good family man, he first speaks with Jethro about his divine appointment, and Jethro sends him to Egypt with his approval and blessing. Thus, Moses goes forward. From here on out, things will move forward in unexpected, and unanticipated, ways.

#### Part III: Life Application

1.	Everything in our lives depends on our picture of God. Who is God for you? How do you see and understand God’s presence in your life? What kind of picture of God do you cultivate?

2.	The most important thing for the Lord is not a thing, possession, accomplishment, agenda, or performance; it is relationships. The living God is the God of relationships. Human relationships start with a vertical relationship with Him and translate into horizontal relationships with one another. How did Moses’ encounter with God make him a new person and a great leader?

3.	God’s calling on our lives is like a broad highway with different paths. Usually, the most demanding task or calling in life can help us to realize that this task or calling is what God wants us to do. The Lord never leads us on an easy or self-centered path. He wants our growth and what is best for us. His Word commands us to go forward, even though the task may look overwhelming or beyond our abilities to perform. How can you recognize and be sure that you follow His calling and vocation in life?

4.	We want to do God’s will according to His plan and vision for us. What excuse do you proffer to God that prevents you from accepting His path for your life? What Bible promises do you need to claim to give you hope and courage on your journey with Him? How do these promises encourage you in your service to others?
