> “The children of Israel groaned because of the bondage, and they cried out; and their cry came up to God because of the bondage. So God heard their groaning, and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God acknowledged them.’” Exodus 2:23-25, NKJV

This week we study the first two chapters of Exodus to see the historical background of the life and eventual ministry of Moses.

### ^[1. God used Egypt to help establish ancient Israel (Sun, Mon, Tue)]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#F19637"}}})

- Abram found refuge and riches in Egypt (Gen. 12:10-20).
- Joseph was sold as a slave in Egypt but later became great (Gen. 45:4-8).
- Jacob’s family was welcomed to Egypt but were later enslaved. (Gen. 47:5,6, 11, 12).
	- The family of Israel flourished prolifically in Egypt (Ex. 1:6, 7)
	- Israel’s tremendous growth angered and frightened the new Pharaoh. (Ex. 1:8-10)
 - Israel prospered in Egypt some 85 years only to be persecuted and enslaved the next 130 years (Ac. 7:17).
	- See Qtly, Mon, par 3, 4; See also note 3 in PP 759
 - Despite their mistreatment, God caused the Israelites to prosper exceedingly in Egypt (Ex. 1:12-20).\
^[There is an interesting similarity between Abraham's experience in Egypt and that of his posterity, centuries later. Both went down into Egypt on account of a famine, and both sojourned there. Through the manifestation of divine judgments in their behalf, the fear of them fell upon the Egyptians; and, enriched by the gifts of the heathen, they went out with great substance. PP 131]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#0070C0"}}})

### ^[2. Moses was providentially positioned to save Israel (Wed, Thu, Fri)]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#F19637"}}})

- Exodus 2 summarizes nearly the first 80 years of Moses’s life and demonstrates God’s providence in His life.
	- Moses was born in Egypt during Israel’s oppression but was miraculously saved from death. (Ex. 1:22-2:9)
	- The early upbringing of Moses was Hebrew, but his next 28 years were spent as Egyptian royalty (Ex. 2:10; Ac. 7:22).\
^[At the court of Pharaoh, Moses received the highest civil and military training. The monarch had determined to make his adopted grandson his successor on the throne, and the youth was educated for his high station. PP 245]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#0070C0"}}})
	- His childhood upbringing molded his life and though emersed in Egyptian learning and culture, he remained loyal to the true God. (Heb. 11:24-26)
- When he was 40 years old, Moses murdered an Egyptian slavedriver for abusing an Israelite.
	- After news of his rash deed spread, Moses fled to Midian where he spent the next 40 years tending the flocks of Jethro and raising a family with Jethro’s daughter, Zipporah.  (Ex. 2:11-22)
	- During this time, Israel’s oppression continued, and they cried out to God for a deliverer. (Ex. 2:23-25)

### ^[3. Israel’s history reveals the Great Controversy (Fri)]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#F19637"}}})

- Satan used famine, internal family hatred (Isaac/Ishmael, Jacob/Esau, and Joseph/brothers), and finally slavery and even a death decree to thwart the plan of redemption, but God overruled each of Satan’s efforts.
- God had made a promise to Abraham, and he kept it. (Gen. 15:13, 14)

### ^[Conclusion]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#0070C0"}}})

^[“The good news in all this is that, despite Satan’s plans, God overruled, and He used faithful people to thwart the enemy. We do live in the territory of our enemy, whom Jesus called ‘the prince’ or ‘ruler of this world’ (Eph. 2:2, NKJV; John 14:30)…Although Satan is still alive and active, as revealed in his attempt to kill those children, his own execution is certain (John 12:31; John 16:11; Rev20:9, 10, 14). The good news is that life’s difficulties can be overcome by God’s grace (Phil. 4:13). That grace is our only hope.” Qtly, Fri, par 2]({"style": {"text": {"color":"#0070C0"}}})
