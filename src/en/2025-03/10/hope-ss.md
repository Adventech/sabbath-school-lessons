### Part #10 The Covenant And The Blueprint

**Scripture Song:** Behold, bless the LORD – Psalm 134

Welcome to Hope Sabbath School—an in-depth interactive study of the Word of God. We are continuing a series of studies on the Book of Exodus: Stories of Deliverance. Today’s topic: THE COVENANT AND THE BLUEPRINT.

- **Confirming the covenant**
	- Exodus 24:1-8 What was the significance of sprinkling the blood of a sacrificed animal on the altar and on the children of Israel?
	- What was the Book of the Covenant Moses read out loud so all the people could hear it? (v.4a)
	- How was it possible for this vast multitude to hear the words Moses was reading? (this whole deliverance journey was a sequence of miracles)
- **Meeting with the LORD on the mountain**
	- Exodus 24:9-11 What amazing revelation was given to a select group of leaders from the children of Israel? How was this revelation also a story of deliverance?
	- Exodus 24:12-16,18 What additional revelation of the LORD was given to the prophet Moses?
	- What revelation from the LORD was given to all the children of Israel who were camped at the base of Mount Sinai? Exodus 24:17
	- Does this revelation of the glory of the LORD remind you of a story in the life of Jesus? Mark 9:2-8
	- What revelation of the glory of the LORD is available to each one of us? (John 14:9, 17:25)
- **Constructing the earthly tabernacle**
	- How was the building of an earthly tabernacle, a portable worship tent, another indication of God’s desire to dwell with His people? Exodus 25:1-9, 40:34
	- While God is not confined to an earthly building (1 Kings 8:27), what special revelation of the LORD’s presence was shown in sanctuary? Exodus 25:22
	- What special assistance was provided to the craftsmen who built the sanctuary and all its contents? Exodus 31:1-11
	- When the LORD gives any of us a special work to do, what promises assure us that He will equip us to accomplish the task? (Acts 1:8, Psalm 32:8, etc.)
- **A pledge of obedience**
	- How did the children of Israel respond to the reading of the Book of the Covenant? Exodus 24:3,7 (see also Exodus 19:8)
	- 	The history of the children of Israel in their wilderness wanderings records their repeated failure to live in harmony with the Book of the Covenant. How is loving obedience possible? (Ezekiel 36:26-28, Philippians 2:12-13, Galatians 2:20, etc.)
	- Share your testimony of learning to obey the LORD in the context of a loving relationship with Him.
