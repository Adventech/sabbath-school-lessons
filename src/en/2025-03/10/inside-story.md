#### Knowing an All-Knowing God

_By Andrew McChesney_

Iqbal didn’t know anything about Jesus when he traveled more than 600 miles from his home to learn English at a Seventh-day Adventist boarding high school in southern Asia.

He had been raised in a non-Christian family, and his parents sent him at the age of 20 to join his sister at the school. She was studying there and excelling in her English classes.

Iqbal attended all the school’s morning and evening worship services. He went to all the Sabbath services. An interest began to beat in his heart to know Jesus. He read the Bible, looking for information about Jesus. His eyes were drawn to Jeremiah 1:5, “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; before you were born I sanctified you” (NKJV).

He thought, I want to know Jesus personally because He knew me personally before He formed me in my mother’s womb.

Weeks turned into months, and Iqbal learned more about Jesus. He thought, Could it be that Jesus brought me more than 600 miles from my home not only to learn English but also to learn about His love?

He began to experience Jesus’ love in his own life, and two and a half years after arriving at the school, he decided to give his heart to Jesus and be baptized.

After graduating from the school, Iqbal went on to receive a Bachelor of Computer Applications from Lowry Adventist College in Bengaluru, India, and to join its staff, where he works in campus ministry activities. Jesus is his life.

“Now, I’m happy to live with Jesus,” he said. “Day by day, Jesus leads me and takes care of me. Whenever I face a problem, Jesus Christ is my refuge and brings me out of the problem.”

Iqbal expressed astonishment at the omniscience of Jesus, the idea that Jesus not only knew him before forming him in his mother’s womb but also knows the needs that he has before he himself is aware of them.

“I thank Jesus that He takes care of my needs long before I even know about them,” he said. “Before I ask, He knows what to give and through whom to give it. This is the reason I trust in Him and love Him more each day.”
