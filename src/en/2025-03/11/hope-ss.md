### Part #11 Apostasy And Intercession

**Scripture Song:** Behold, bless the LORD – Psalm 134

Welcome to Hope Sabbath School—an in-depth interactive study of the Word of God. We are continuing a series of studies on the Book of Exodus: Stories of Deliverance. Today’s topic: APOSTASY AND INTERCESSION.

- **Apostasy at Sinai**
	- Exodus 32:1 Why do you think the children of Israel were so quick to abandon their faithfulness to the LORD God who had delivered them from Egypt?
	- Exodus 32:2-5 What are your thoughts about the conduct of Aaron, the brother of Moses?
	- What lesson can we learn for our lives today?
	- How could this apostasy have been averted?
	- Exodus 32:6 How did the children of Israel behave in this pagan celebration? (NLT, NIV, NASB)
	- What are some ways people worship gods of their own making today?
- **Responding to the apostasy**
	- Exodus 32:7-10 Did the initial response of the LORD to Moses reveal His true character or was this a teaching opportunity about compassion?
	- Exodus 32:11-13 How did Moses respond?
	- Exodus 32:14 Did Moses really change the LORD’s mind and make Him more compassionate?
	- Exodus 32:15-19 What are your thoughts about the reaction of Moses when he saw the golden calf and the pagan revelry of the children of Israel? What indication is there that his reaction was inappropriate? (Exodus 34:1-4)
	- Exodus 32:20 Was Moses overreacting here?
	- Exodus 32:21-24 What are your thoughts about the excuses oﬀered by Aaron? What response would you have hoped for?
	- Exodus 32:25-28 Was this random slaughter ordered at the direct instruction of the LORD or was this still an angry response by Moses?
- **Interceding for his people**
	- What are your thoughts about the way Moses interceded on behalf of his people? Exodus 32:29-32
	- How does this intercession of Moses compare to the intercession of Jesus on the cross? Luke 23:34
	- Share a time when someone interceded for you. How did the LORD show mercy to you?
- **The consequence of apostasy**
	- What consequence came upon those who had engaged in the apostasy at Sinai and were unrepentant? Exodus 32:33-35
	- Why is it always better to trust the judgment of the LORD rather than take judgment into our own hands? (1 Samuel 16:7, Matthew 7:1, etc.)
	- What assurance do we have that the LORD will be merciful to sinners who repent of their sin and humbly ask for mercy? Psalm 51:1-2, Psalm 86:3-5, 1 John 1:7-9, etc.
