### Part #9 Living The Law

**Scripture Song:** Behold, bless the LORD – Psalm 134

Welcome to Hope Sabbath School—an in-depth interactive study of the Word of God. We are continuing a series of studies on the Book of Exodus: Stories of Deliverance. Today’s topic: LIVING THE LAW.

- **God’s original plan of deliverance to the Promised Land**
	- Exodus 14:13-14 What important lesson was the LORD teaching through the deliverance of the children of Israel at the Red Sea?
	- Exodus 23:20-33 What was the LORD’s plan for the ongoing deliverance of the children of Israel?
	- Why were the children of Israel so slow to learn this lesson during their wilderness wanderings?
	- Why is it important for each one of us to trust in the LORD as our Savior and strong Deliverer? (Psalm 20:7, 2 Chronicles 20:17, Deuteronomy 31:6, etc.)
- **The need for additional laws**
	- Review the Ten Commandments given by the LORD through Moses at Sinai. Exodus 20:1-17
	- Think about the condition of the children of Israel after their deliverance from Egypt. Why was it necessary for God to provide other laws in addition to the Ten Commandments?
	- Briefly review these additional laws.
		- Related to servants – Exodus 21:1-6, 7-11
		- Related to violence – Exodus 21: 12-21, 22-27
		- Related to animals – Exodus 21:28-36
		- Related to property – Exodus 22:1-6, 7-15
		- Related to moral conduct – Exodus 22:16-31
		- Related to justice for all – Exodus 23:1-9
		- Related to Sabbaths and annual feast– Exodus 23:10-12,14-19
	- What impresses about these additional laws?
	- How did the provision of these additional laws demonstrate the love and care of the LORD?
- **Going beyond the letter of the law**
	- According to Jesus, what two great commandments summarize all the laws the LORD gave through Moses? Matthew 22:37-39
	- Consider some ways Jesus challenged His hearers to go beyond the letter of the law and discover the spirit of the law, both in the Ten Commandments and the civil laws given to the children of Israel.
		- You shall not murder – Matthew 5:21-26
		- You shall not commit adultery –Matthew 5:27-30
		- How to treat your enemy – Matthew 5:38-48
	- Share a time when Jesus demonstrated the spirit of the law even though He faced fierce opposition from religious leaders. Matthew 12:9-14, etc.
	- Why is it important to let God bring judgment on those who harass us or persecute us rather than seek vengeance ourselves? Romans 12:19,21, etc.
	- What important lesson have you learned from our study today?
