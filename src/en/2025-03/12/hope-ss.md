### Part #12 Please, Show Me Your Glory

**Scripture Song:** Behold, bless the LORD – Psalm 134

Welcome to Hope Sabbath School—an in-depth interactive study of the Word of God. We are continuing a series of studies on the Book of Exodus: Stories of Deliverance. Today’s topic: PLEASE, SHOW ME YOUR GLORY.

- **The Tent of Meeting**
	- What was the Tent of Meeting and where was it located? Exodus 33:7 (not the Sanctuary)
	- What remarkable encounters occurred in the Tent of Meeting? Exodus 33:8-11a
	- How was Moses impacted by these times of intimate communion with the LORD? (see Exodus 34:34-35)
	- Who stayed in the Tent of Meeting when the LORD wasn’t meeting with Moses? Why? Exodus 33:11b
	- When Jesus returns in glory, we will commune with Him face to face (1 John 3:2-3), but how can we reflect the glory of the LORD even now? (2 Corinthians 3:18, Hebrews 12:1-2, John 8:12, etc.)
- **Seeking a closer relationship with God**
	- What request did Moses make to the LORD, recorded in Exodus 33:12-13?
	- Didn’t Moses already know the LORD? What was the intent of his prayer? (see 2 Peter 3:18)
	- When did you become aware of a desire to have a closer relationship with God?
	- What additional request did Moses make? Exodus 33:13-18
	- How did the LORD respond to this request of Moses? Exodus 33:19-23
	- Earlier in this chapter we learned that Moses and the LORD communed face to face (v.11). Then we are told that no-one can behold God’s face and live (v.20). How do you explain that apparent contradiction?
- **The second giving of the Ten Commandments**
	- Exodus 34:1 Why do you think the LORD commanded Moses to cut two tablets of stone, like the ones he had broken in a fit of anger?
	- Exodus 34:2-4 What additional instructions did the LORD give to Moses and how did he respond?
	- What happened when Moses climbed up the mountain as the LORD had instructed him to do? Exodus 34:5-7
	- How did Moses respond to this encounter with the LORD? Exodus 34:8-9
	- What promise did the LORD make to Moses? Exodus 34:10
	- What warnings and instructions did the LORD give to Moses? Exodus 34:11-17,18-28
	- How faithfully did the children of Israel heed those warnings and instructions from the LORD?
	- What lessons can we learn about the compassion and patience of God? (Exodus 34:6-7, 2 Peter 3:9)
