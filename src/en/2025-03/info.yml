  title: "Exodus"
  description: "The God revealed in the book of Exodus is the loving Lord who, at the appointed time and with His mighty actions, brought salvation and deliverance to His people (Gen. 15:12–16). The exodus from Egypt and the crossing of the Red Sea were pivotal and unique events—God’s spectacular and marvelous acts. No greater or more glorious event ever happened in the history of ancient Israel before the Cross. It is the gospel, but according to Moses."
