### Outline #3 Cain and His Legacy

*  Cain and Abel
	* Genesis 4:1 How does the name of their first-born son reveal the expectation of his parents, Adam and Eve?
	* (Qanah – acquired)
	* What contrast do you see in the description and naming of their second son? (Hebel – vapor/breath)
	* What lesson can we learn from these misguided expectations?

*  The Two Offerings
	* Genesis 4:3-5 Why did the LORD God accept Abel’s offering and reject Cain’s offering?
	* The author of Hebrews describes Abel’s offering as “a more excellent sacrifice”. Why? Hebrews 11:4
	* Share some other examples from the Scriptures where a religious act was in fact an act of rebellion. (King Saul offering sacrifices, people worshipping the bronze serpent, etc.)

*  The First Murder
	* Genesis 4:4-5 Was Cain angry with God, Abel, or both? Why? (see also 1 John 3:11-12)
	* What can we learn from the way the LORD approached Cain? Genesis 4:6-7
	* What was the consequence when Cain allowed sinful thoughts to control his behavior? Genesis 4:8
	* How does the inspired counsel of James help us to understand what happened to Cain? James 1:13-15
	* Share an encouraging promise that gives you hope when you experience an intense temptation. 1 Corinthians 10:13, Psalm 50:15, etc.

*  The Punishment of Cain
	* Genesis 4:9a What is the significance of the LORD’s question to Cain after the death of Abel?
	* What indications do you see of a repentant attitude in the response of Cain? Genesis 4:9b
	* Genesis 4:10 What important lesson can we learn from the response of the LORD to Cain’s avoidance of any admission of guilt? (see Hebrews 4:12-13)
	* Genesis 4:11-15 What are your thoughts about Cain’s punishment and his response to it?

*  The Descendants of Cain and Seth
	* Genesis 4:17-24 What differences do you see between the attitude of these two murderers—Cain and Lamech?
	* Genesis 6:5-6 What does this tragic testimony tell us about the way of transgression? (see also Psalm 1:1)
	* While sin and rebellion increased exponentially among the descendants of Cain, there was another distinct part of Adam’s family. Genesis 4:25, 5:24
	* What word of hope do you see recorded in Genesis 4:26? (see also Romans 10:13)
