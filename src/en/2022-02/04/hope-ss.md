### Outline #4 The Flood

*  The Reason for the Global Flood
	* Genesis 6:1-7,11-12 What was the reason for this cataclysmic flood? (not climate change)
	* Share other times of divine judgment due to rampant wickedness. (Sodom and Gomorrah, etc.)
	* How are these judgments of God also acts of mercy?

*  Preparation for the Flood
	* Why did the LORD God give a special assignment to Noah? Genesis 6:8, 6:13-22, 7:1-5
	* The same Hebrew word translated ark, (tevah), is used when describing Moses’ basket and the Ark of the Covenant. What significance do you see here?
	* What other important activity did Noah engage in besides building the ark? 2 Peter 2:5
	* Why did only Noah’s family enter the ark of safety that God had provided? Hebrews 11:7, 2 Peter 3:9

*  An Undoing of Creation
	* Genesis 7:11-12, 17-24 Where do you see an undoing of creation in this account of the global flood?
	* Genesis 8:1a What is meant by the expression “God remembered Noah”? Was he ever forgotten by God? (see Genesis 19:29, Psalm 106:4, Luke 23:42)
	* How did the LORD God continue to fulfill His promise to deliver Noah after the global flood? Genesis 8:1b-4
	* What quality exhibited by Noah in the past was still needed during this time? (see Hebrews 11:7) Why?

*  The Beginning of a New Creation
	* Genesis 8:5-14 What events indicated that it would soon be time to leave the ark?
	* How did Noah and his family know when it was the right time to leave the ark? Genesis 8:15-16
	* Why did Noah obey the command of the LORD to leave the ark? He could have said, “I’ll just stay here because the fountains of the deep might break loose again.”
	* How can we experience such a deep and abiding faith and trust in God?

*  The LORD’s Covenant of Life
	* What can we learn from Noah’s first activity after leaving the ark? Genesis 8:20
	* Genesis 8:21 Was the smell of burning animal flesh really a soothing aroma to the LORD?
	* Genesis 9:1-4 Why was there a change in diet after the flood, with what restrictions and consequences?
	* Genesis 9:8-17 Why was the sign of the LORD’s covenant of life so significant?
	* The promises of God are sure. Share a promise of God that is especially precious to you.
