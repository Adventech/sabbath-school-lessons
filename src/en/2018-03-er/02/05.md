Jesus Has A Place Of Honor At God’s Right Side (Acts 2:33)

In the third part of his sermon, Peter talks again about the Holy Spirit’s gift that causes God’s people to speak in different languages. This gift is the reason the Jews come to hear Peter talk in the first place. Peter tells them that he and the other followers who speak in different languages are not drunk. That would be strange at nine o’clock in the morning (Acts 2:15)! Then Peter explains that the believers speak in different languages because God poured on them the Holy Spirit from heaven. 

Read Acts 2:33–36. In these verses, what is the connection between (1) God giving Jesus a place of honor at His side and (2) God giving the Holy Spirit to Jesus’ followers?

“At God’s right side” (Acts 2:33, ERV) is a word picture. It shows us that God gives Jesus much power (Psalm 110:1–3). Peter explains that God poured out His Spirit on Jesus’ followers because God gave Jesus a place of high honor in heaven. God does not give something new to Jesus. Jesus held this place of honor before (John 1:1–3; John 17:5). But now Jesus’ place of honor shows everyone that God the Father sees His Son as both the Lord and Savior of all humans who believe in Him (Acts 2:36).
Jesus’ place of honor at God’s side is connected to one of the most important topics in the Bible: the big war between good and evil. This big war helps us understand that the Holy Spirit cannot fully come to humans until Jesus stands at God’s right side (John 7:39). Jesus stands at God’s right side because He wins the victory over sin at the cross (John 17:4, 5). These verses show us that Jesus needs to go to His place of honor at God’s right side first. Then the Holy Spirit can come to this earth. Why? Because the Holy Spirit’s coming shows that God accepts Jesus’ death for us. Jesus wins, and Satan loses (John 12:31). Before Jesus’ death, sin hides God from us. So, we need Jesus’ death to save us. Jesus’ death also shows that Satan lied about God. While Jesus is on Earth, He forgives sins and saves people from demons. The cross gives Jesus the power to do those things. So, what happens when God accepts Jesus’ death on the cross? God crushes Satan’s work on the earth. And in our time, God will pour out His Spirit on His people to get them ready for Jesus’ Second Coming.
