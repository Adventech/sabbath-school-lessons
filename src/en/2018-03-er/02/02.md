 (Acts 2:1–3)

Jesus commands His followers to wait in Jerusalem for God to give them the Holy Spirit. So, Jesus’ followers obey. They wait and pray. They ask God for power over their sins. They praise God. Then the special day comes that Jesus promises. Jesus’ followers “were all together in one place” (Acts 2:1, ERV). This place may be the same large room in Acts 1. Soon the believers will move to a place that is more public (Acts 2:6–13).

Read Acts 2:1–3. What miracles and special show of power happen at the same time that God pours out His Spirit on His people?

First, there is a noise from heaven. It roars the same as a windstorm. The wind’s roar fills the whole place. Then small flames “came down on each” person. Yes, the Spirit always works with God’s people in the Old Testament. But now God’s people see the Spirit’s power with their own eyes. “During the time of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, God showed the power of the Holy Spirit to humans in a powerful way. But humans never saw the whole power of the Holy Spirit. Now, Jesus’ followers prayed for the gift of the Spirit that Jesus promised them. In heaven, Jesus added His prayers to His followers’ prayers. Jesus asked God the Father for the gift of the Spirit. Jesus wanted to pour this gift out on His people.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles [leaders and teachers], page 37, adapted.  
Before this miracle happens, John the Baptist tells everyone that God’s people will be baptized by the Holy Spirit (Luke 3:16; read also Acts 11:16). The baptism by the Spirit will happen after the coming of the Messiah. The Messiah is the Savior God chose to save His people from sin. Jesus also talks about how He will give the Spirit to His followers (Luke 24:49; Acts 1:8). Jesus asks God to pour the Spirit on His people at Pentecost. Pentecost is the time when God pours out His Spirit on His church. Pentecost is the first time that Jesus works in heaven for His people (John 14:16, 26; John 15:26). At Pentecost, God’s promise to His people comes true. God sends them the Spirit. Pentecost happened one time. But we need to ask God to fill us with His Spirit every day.

How do you know God’s Spirit is working on your life?
