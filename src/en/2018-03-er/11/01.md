> <p>Memory verse</p>
> “ ‘The next night the Lord Jesus came and stood by Paul. He said, ‘Be brave! You have told people in Jerusalem about me. You must do the same in Rome’ ” (Acts 23:11, ERV). 

A FIGHT STARTS IN THE CHURCH soon after Paul makes his first trip to share the Good News about Jesus with other people. The fight is about the things that non-Jews needed to do first before they joined the church (Acts 15:1–5). Maybe Paul already knows about the trouble in the future. So, he makes a plan to keep peace in the church. He also invites the non-Jewish churches to give money to help the believers in Judea (1 Corinthians 16:1). Paul hopes that this gift will help stop the fuss. 

Danger waits for Paul in Jerusalem. But Paul wants to bring peace to the church. This fact may help explain why Paul goes to Jerusalem anyway. Paul also has a real love for his people, the Jews (Romans 9:1–5). He wants church members to get along with each other (Galatians 3:28; Galatians 5:6). Both Jews and non-Jews are saved in the same way. They are saved by faith, not by obeying the law (Romans 3:28–30). So, Paul is against any teaching that goes against the truth of the Good News about Jesus (Ephesians 2:11–22). This week, let us follow Paul as he enters this new time in his life and his work for God.
