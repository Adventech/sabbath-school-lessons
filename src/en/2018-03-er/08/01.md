### Read for this week’s lesson
Acts 15; Galatians 2:11–13; Exodus 12:43–49; Romans 3:30; Leviticus 18:30. 

> <p>Memory verse</p>
> “ ‘We believe it is by the loving-favor of the Lord Jesus that we are saved. They [the non-Jews] are saved from the punishment of sin the same way’ ” (Acts 15:11, NLV).

AFTER TWO YEARS, Paul and Barnabas came back to Antioch in Syria. They told the church about their work. Paul and Barnabas did not brag about the things they did. They told the church how God used them to do His work. 

What is the reason for their report? Paul and Barnabas want to tell the church about their success in sharing the Good News with the non-Jews. After Cornelius accepts Jesus, many other non-Jews join the church too. But many Jewish believers have a big problem with non-Jews joining the church. Why? Because the non-Jews are not circumcised. Circumcised means that the extra skin on the end of the male sex organ is cut off. Jewish males are circumcised to show they belong to God. So, many Jewish believers are not happy when large numbers of non-Jews join the church. The Jewish believers feel that the non-Jews need to be circumcised first. Then they can join the church.

Acts 15 talks about this problem and how the Jerusalem Group solved it. The Jerusalem Group made big decisions for the church. They met to solve different problems in the church during this important time in New Testament history.
