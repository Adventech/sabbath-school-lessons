Paul and his friends leave Cyprus and sail to Perga. Perga is on the south coast of land that belongs to Turkey today. Then Paul and his friends go to a city named Antioch in the country of Pisidia. But before that happens, Luke tells us about two important changes that happen. First, Paul becomes the group’s leader. Up to now, Luke always says Barnabas’s name first in the story. Second, Luke stops using Paul’s Jewish name, “Saul” (Acts 13:9). Here, Luke starts using the name “Paul.” Why? Maybe because Paul is now mostly with people who follow Greek and Roman ways. 

Acts 13:13 tells us that John Mark goes back to Jerusalem. Acts does not tell us the reason why John Mark leaves Paul. Ellen G. White says that John Mark feels afraid and hopeless about all the hard times they will meet in the future. “Mark became afraid. He lost all courage. He refused to go forward. So, he went back to Jerusalem.”—The Acts of the Apostles [leaders and teachers], page 170, adapted. God never promises us that the work He gives us will be easy. Paul knows from the beginning that he will suffer a lot for serving Jesus (Acts 9:16). But Paul learns to trust fully in God’s power. That trust in God is how Paul stays strong (2 Corinthians 4:7–10). 

`Read Acts 13:38. As these verses shows us, what truth is at the center of Paul’s message to the Jews in Antioch?`

In Acts 13:16–41, we find Paul’s first sermon in the New Testament. Of course, this sermon is not the first one that Paul ever preached. For sure, these verses do not tell us everything Paul says in his sermon.

The sermon has three parts. The sermon starts with two truths. The first truth is that God chose Israel as His people and chose David to be king (Acts 13:17–23). The first part of Paul’s sermon shows the Jews that their beliefs are the same as Paul’s. Next, Paul’s sermon shows the Jews that Jesus is the Savior who makes all God’s promises come true. Jesus is a future son of David. Only Jesus can save Israel (Acts 13:24–37). Then, the last part of Paul’s sermon is a warning. It warns the Jews not to turn away from God’s plan to save them (Acts 13:38–41). Acts 13:38, 39 is about the truth that Jesus makes us right with God. The law cannot save us. Only Jesus forgives us and makes us clean (Romans 10:1–4; Galatians 2:16).
