### God's Grace is a Gift

**Dear student,**

You are a gift from God, and He loves you very much! If the Lord knows each star by name and makes sure that it is in the proper place each night (Isaiah 40:26), how much more important are you?

Not every person is alike. Look around you. Everyone has different color eyes, hair, skin, and build (tall, short, big-boned, and thin). We all learn differently. Some people learn by listening, others by sight, and still others by touch. Some people use all three ways to learn.

Regardless of how you learn, the Lord wants you to love Him and serve Him with all your heart. You do that when you pray, learn about Him (in your lesson study), talk about Him to others, and do what is right.

Here is a great truth you should know about the Lord: Jesus isn’t primarily concerned about how well you can read or write, or even how well you can speak. What Jesus cares about most is how much you love Him and want Him in your life. The greatest accomplishment in your life will be to show others how much God has blessed your life.

In school you use different ways to get the information that you want. Use those same ways to learn more about the Lord: Use your computer, iPod, or iPad to hear or study your lesson. Or have your parents read your lesson to you. Use the Bible on CD, or the audio podcast of your lesson at www.juniorpowerpoints.org /podcast.php?channel=1. It does not matter which way you get the information, as long as you are growing and maturing in the Lord.

Think about this when you meet Jesus face to face: He is not going to ask to see how well you write something. He will not ask you to read anything. His only pursuit is to read your heart to see how much you love Him. He wants to spend eternity with you!

### How to use this Bible study guide

The lessons and stories in this Bible study guide include principles that you can apply to your everyday life. They encourage you to communicate with God through prayer, reading from your Bible, and reflecting on what you read. That is how to grow in your relationship with Jesus. You will study the Bible lesson during the week, and in Sabbath School you will review it with your teacher and peers. This review process will help you gain a deeper spiritual understanding of the lessons.

A big part of your Sabbath School lesson is the study you do from the Bible and the discussions you have with your teachers and peers on Sabbath. Learn and review the power text during the week as you prepare for Sabbath School. As you memorize passages from the Bible you will become familiar- ized with the truths found in God’s Word, and you will learn to apply them to your life. As you study your Sabbath School lesson, engage your family members in discussion and share with them what you learned.

Most important, please take time to read, pray, and reflect on Jesus every day. Ask Him to help you apply what you study to what you do in real life. It isn’t only what you know with your head, but it’s also what you know with your heart, that helps you be a strong, growing Christian.

Happy growing in Jesus! —The Editor
