### Introduction

During the time when Josiah was king (640–609 b.c.), a person in Jerusalem found a book. Someone read the book to King Josiah. “When the king heard the words of the Book of the Law, he tore his clothes to show he was sad and upset” (2 Kings 22:11, ERV). Why was the king sad and upset? Because he saw that he and his people were not obeying the laws written in the book.

This book was known as the Book of the Agreement (2 Kings 23:2, ERV). This book caused Josiah to make many big changes for the better in the land. We can read in 2 Kings 23 about the changes Josiah made.

We believe the book that caused Josiah to make all these big changes was Deuteronomy. We shall study this book this quarter.

Deuteronomy is the 5th book in the set of books known as the Five Books of Moses. The name Deuteronomy comes from the Latin word “deuteronomium.” “Deuteronomium” means “second law.”

What is Deuteronomy all about?

Deuteronomy is all about the time when Israel was getting ready to enter the Promised Land. 40 years before, the children of Israel left Egypt. They made an agreement with the Lord at Sinai. Then they walked around in the desert for the next 40 years. When they finished walking for 40 years, Moses talked with the people. He gave them many messages from the Lord. Moses said almost the same as these words to the Israelites: “You are about to enter the Promised Land. Finally! Do not forget everything the Lord has done for you. Do not forget everything He asks of you now. He wants you to love Him with all your heart and mind. He also wants you to show Him and other people that you love Him by obeying all the commandments that are written in the agreement.” Of course, these words are not the exact words Moses said. But these words come very close. They show us the chief message of Deuteronomy: remember the agreement.

Moses wanted the people to understand that the agreement with God was very impor­tant. So, Moses told them the Ten Commandments again. The Ten Commandments showed the people everything they must do for God. God first made this agreement with their fathers. Now the Lord makes the same agreement again with them, the children of Israel. God makes this agreement right before they can cross into the Promised Land.

We, too, stand on the borders of the Promised Land. That Promised Land is heaven. What can we learn from the experience of Israel that can help us now?

The name of the Bible study guide for this quarter is “Deuteronomy: The Truth We Need Most for Our Time.” Another name for the truth we need most for our time is “present truth.” This quarter, we will look at present-truth messages in Deuteronomy. We will see what these messages can teach us.

We will study Deuteronomy by looking at different topics in the book. Some of these topics include: (1) the agreement that continues forever, (2) law and mercy, and (3) loving God and our neighbor. Most important of all, we will look at how Deuteronomy shows us the love of God. This love was shown in a powerful way in the death of Jesus for us on the cross and His waking up from the dead.

Sure, thousands of years separate our church today from the “church” in the desert. But maybe we and Israel are more alike than we are different. Moses said many words to Israel that, for sure, have meaning for us as a church today. Here is one example: “ ‘I taught you the laws and rules that the Lord my God commanded me. I did this so you could obey them in the land you are ready to enter and take for your own. Obey these laws carefully. This will show the people of the other nations [countries] that you are wise and sensible [understanding]. They will hear about these laws and say, “Truly [for sure], the people of this great nation are wise and sensible” ’ ” (Deuteronomy 4:5, 6, ERV).

Do you see that the laws do not show that Israel is a wise and understanding people? If we do not obey laws, then laws are worth nothing. So, the laws God gave Israel did not show that Israel was wise. Their obedience to these laws did. There is a lesson for us here, for sure. Just one of many lessons, as we will see, from the book of Deuteronomy.
