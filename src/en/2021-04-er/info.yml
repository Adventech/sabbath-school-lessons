  title: "Deuteronomy: The Truth We Need Most for Our Time"
  description: "During the time when Josiah was king (640–609 b.c.), a person in Jerusalem found a book. Someone read the book to King Josiah. “When the king heard the words of the Book of the Law, he tore his clothes to show he was sad and upset” (2 Kings 22:11, ERV). Why was the king sad and upset? Because he saw that he and his people were not obeying the laws written in the book. This book was known as the Book of the Agreement (2 Kings 23:2, ERV). This book caused Josiah to make many big changes for the better in the land. We can read in 2 Kings 23 about the changes Josiah made."
