**Testimony** <a class="verse" verse="Gal 5:6">Gal. 5:6</a>

“Certain Jews from Judea raised a general consternation among the believing Gentiles by agitating the question of circumcision.They asserted with great assurance, that none could be saved without being circumcised and keeping the whole ceremonial law.”1 Thus the false brothers were slow “to discern to the end of that which had been abolished by the death of Christ, . . . rendering valueless the divinely appointed ceremonies and sacrifices of the Jewish religion.”2

**“We must love and obey the truth for this time. This will save us from accepting strong delusions.”**

“Paul had prided himself upon his Pharisaical strictness; but after the revelation of Christ to him on the road to Damascus, the mission of the Saviour, and his own work in the conversion of the Gentiles, were plain to his mind; and he fully comprehended the difference between a living faith and a dead formalism.”3

 “[Peter] reasoned that the Holy Spirit had decided the matter under dispute by descending with equal power upon the uncircumcised Gentiles and the circumcised Jews.”4 He stated that “ ‘God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as He did unto us; and put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.’ ”5

“Everyone who has a knowledge of the truth should awake and place himself, body, soul, and spirit, under the discipline of God. . . . We must love and obey the truth for this time.This will save us from accepting strong delusions.”6

“I beseech those who are laboring for God not to accept the spurious for the genuine. Let not human reason be placed where divine, sanctifying truth should be. . . . Let not erroneous theories receive countenance from people who ought to be standing firm on the platform of eternal truth.”7
