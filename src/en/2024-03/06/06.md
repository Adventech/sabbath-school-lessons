`Read Mark 8:11–13. What approach by the Pharisees deeply disappointed Jesus?`

Why not demonstrate His divine power and convince these cavilers? The problem goes back to the end of Mark 3, where Jesus speaks of the sin against the Holy Spirit. If one’s ears are shut and eyes are closed, another miracle, even a sign from heaven, will not convince. It would just be dismissed like everything before. Even miracles are not enough to convince those determined not to believe.

`Read Mark 8:14–21. What had the disciples forgotten, and what point did Jesus make from this?`

Jesus takes the opportunity to warn the disciples against the “leaven” of the Pharisees and Herod (Mark 8:15), meaning their teachings (compare with Matt. 16:12).

But the disciples misunderstand and think that Jesus is talking about avoiding buying literal bread. As is typical when the disciples misunderstand, Jesus gives them instruction. The Lord asks a series of questions, the first several rhetorical in nature, expressing His disappointment that they have not understood His mission. His words are reminiscent of what He says in Mark 4:10–12 about outsiders who do not understand. His strong words are meant to wake the disciples from their spiritual lethargy.

In Mark 8:19, 20, He asks simple factual questions about how many baskets of fragments they had taken up after He fed the 5,000 (Mark 6:30–44) and also the 4,000 (Mark 8:1–10), which are meant to illustrate that they should have understood by now that mere limitation of resources is no barrier for the Lord’s Messiah. His final question in Mark 8:21 is rhetorical once again: “ ‘Do you not yet understand?’ ” (ESV). After all, look at all that they have seen and experienced already with Jesus.

`How can we learn to keep our hearts and minds open to the reality of God and to His love? Dwell on all the evidence that we have been given for God and for His love. At times, though, why does it seem so easy to doubt?`
