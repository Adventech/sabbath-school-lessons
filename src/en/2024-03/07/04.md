`Read Mark 9:1–13. What did Peter, James, and John see one night with Jesus?`

In Mark 9:1, Jesus predicts that some standing with Him would not taste death before seeing the kingdom of God come in power. That prediction is fulfilled within a few days when He takes Peter, James, and John up a high mountain alone. There He is transfigured before them into the glory of the heavenly kingdom.

Elijah and Moses appear from the heavenly realm and converse with Jesus. Luke notes that they were talking about Jesus’ departure (Greek exodos) that He was about to accomplish in Jerusalem (Luke 9:30, 31). Thus, this scene of glory is tied to Jesus’ coming death on the cross (compare with Mark 9:9). It would give hope when the disciples see Him crucified.

Upon descending the mountain the following morning, the three disciples ask Jesus about Elijah coming first. Likely this idea is tied to the expectation that Elijah would reappear before the Messiah (compare with Mal. 4:5, 6). Jesus replies that Elijah has already come, a reference to John the Baptist. Just as they killed John, so Jesus will die at their hands, but He will rise after three days.

After the night of glory, the scene at the bottom of the mountain was sad chaos (see Mark 9:14–29). The nine disciples had encountered a demon-possessed boy whom they could not heal. When Jesus arrives at the scene, everyone runs to see Him. The story unfolds of the demon’s power over the child. Jesus seems to take a long time inquiring about the details of the demon possession. It proves too much for the father, who blurts out, “ ‘If You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us’ ” (Mark 9:22, NKJV).

Jesus immediately picks up on the expression of doubt. The Lord’s response can be paraphrased, “What do you mean, ‘_If_  You can’?” (Mark 9:23). Suddenly, like a bolt of lightning from the sky, the father sees that it is not only his son who has a problem—he has a problem of unbelief. And his unbelief could result in his son not being healed. The desperate father casts himself on Jesus’ mercy with the memorable line, “ ‘I believe; help my unbelief!’ ” (Mark 9:24, NKJV). Jesus heals the boy.

`In what situations, if any, have you had to cry out, “ ‘I believe; help my unbelief’ ”? What did you learn from those experiences?`
