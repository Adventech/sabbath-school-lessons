`How intimate is your experience with God?`

`Why is this intimacy foreign to other so-called Christians?`

`What fruit have you seen in your walk with God?`

`How has your new-covenant experience been more vivified through this study of “Decoding the Covenants”?`

`What specific areas could be improved in your “abiding” with Him?`

`How has this quarter reaffirmed your identity as a Seventh-day Adventist who believes in the entire Bible as a whole?`

`How has this quarter challenged you personally and spiritually?`

`Why do you think God has led you personally to the completion of this study on His covenants?`
