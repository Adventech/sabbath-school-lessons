`Why does God discipline at all?`

`How are curses actually blessings?`

`When did a hardship you experienced turn out later to be a blessing in disguise?`

`How has God disciplined your through the covenant blessings and curses?`

`How has Jesus personally trained and disciplined you?`

`How have all things worked together for you?`

`How have you experienced the benefit package of being a divine covenant member? If you have not, why not yet?`

`How do we explain these experiences to someone who might not know Jesus?`
