  title: "Decoding the Covenants"
  description: "You are invited to an adventurous study with a challenge: the Bible appears to have two opinions of the covenants that contradict each other! On the one hand, it describes God’s “old”/Sinai covenant and law as: “for your good” (Deut. 10:13, NKJV); written by God in the heart (Deut. 30:10–14); “perfect,” “converting the soul” (Ps. 19:7, NKJV); “freedom” (Ps. 119:44, 45, NIV); established by faith (Rom. 3:31); “holy . . . righteous . . . good . . . spiritual” (Rom. 7:12, 14, NIV); a “tutor” that leads people to Christ (Gal. 3:23, 24, NKJV); and so forth. On the other hand, the covenants are also described as: a tutor no longer needed once one comes to Christ (Gal. 3:24, 25); of “the flesh,” not the Spirit (Gal. 4:23, 30); keeping people from “shar[ing] in the [eternal] inheritance” (Gal. 4:3, NIV); “a yoke of slavery” (Gal. 5:1, NIV); a “letter [that] kills” (2 Cor. 3:6, NKJV); a “ministry that brought death [and] . . . condemns” (2 Cor. 3:7, 9, NIV); keeping people “under the law,” not “under grace” (Rom. 6:14); something we must die to in order to be married to Christ and receive salvation (Rom. 7:1–4); something that became obsolete once the new covenant had come (Heb. 8:13); and so forth."
