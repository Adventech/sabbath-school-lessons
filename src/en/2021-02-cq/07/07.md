`Explain the difference between historical and experiential old/new covenants.`

`What are the dangerous ramifications of confusing the two?`

`In what ways have you experienced the old covenant experientially? In what ways have you experienced the new covenant experientially?`

`How is the understanding of the gospel veiled in society and in the world?`

`How have you experienced the “glory” of the gospel?`

`How can you understand 2 Corinthians in your own words with your own illustrations?`

`When have there been clear instances where you saw the character, glory, transformative power, and/or conversion experience in people’s hearts?`
