`When was there a time when you were having a difficult discussion with someone only to discover that each of you had different definitions for the issue?`

`How is it possible that some do not rely on Hebrews 8:10–12 as their definition of the new covenant?`

`Why do you think God said that what necessitated a new covenant was how the people responded to the old covenant?`

`Why would God consider how one responds to His covenant to be such a big deal?`

`What is the main difference between knowing God and knowing about Him?`

`How has clarifying the new covenant helped your view of God and/or the Bible?`

`How have you responded to the covenant promises of God?`

`How would you have defined the new covenant before studying Hebrews 8:10–12?`
