`How challenging has this quarter's lesson been so far? (Keep pressing on!)`

`What are some profound insights from this week’s lesson?`

`In your own words, describe the two slaveries.`

`How does understanding the old and new covenants as “reactions” help understand the tension between the two?`

`What are some of the obvious problems that emerge if the old and new covenants were two contradictory systems of salvation?`

`How does one explain this to someone who is a self-professed “new covenant” Christian?`

`How would you respond to someone who used some text in Galatians 4:21–5:1 to prove to you that sharing the Sabbath teaching with someone threatens putting them in spiritual bondage?`

`Do you see the thread of freedom, healing, and hope in Jesus throughout the Bible?`
