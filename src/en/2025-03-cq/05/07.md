Share insights from this week’s memory verse and Bible study as well as any discoveries, observations, and questions with your Sabbath School class (or Bible study group). Consider these discussion questions with the rest of the group.

`What do you think drove Pharaoh to continually refuse God’s requests?`

`Have you ever read about the Egyptian gods? Look some of them up on the internet (e.g., www.britannica.com/list/11-egyptian-gods-and-goddesses). Why would God want to attack the gods of another country?`

`Do false miracles like the ones worked by the Egyptian magicians still happen today? Consider Matthew 24:24; Revelation 13:13, 14; 16:14.`

`What do miracles accomplish, and what do they not accomplish?`

`What miracles have you seen?`

`Are miracles important to the Christian experience? Why or why not?`

`How did God show mercy to the Egyptians?`

`What significance do you see in some of Pharaoh’s servants believing and supporting Moses?`

`What was the purpose of the plagues? Why are they such a pivotal story in the Old Testament?`
