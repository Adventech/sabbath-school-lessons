`What’s the biggest miracle you’ve ever seen God perform?`

`What’s God’s purpose in leading us into wilderness experiences?`

`What wilderness time have you been through in your life? How did God work things out even better than if you’d never had that experience?`

`How much pressure to join the whining and complaining do you think the faithful Israelites faced? (Exod. 15:24; 16:2, 7; 17:2)`
