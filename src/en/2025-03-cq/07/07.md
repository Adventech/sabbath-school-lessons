Share insights from this week’s memory verse and Bible study as well as any discoveries, observations, and questions with your Sabbath School class (or Bible study group). Consider these discussion questions with the rest of the group.

`Think of an important or exciting event you’ve looked forward to. What was it like when it finally happened? Did it live up to your expectations?`

`What do you think the Israelites were thinking and feeling on their last night in Egypt?`

`How do you think the destruction that happened during the tenth plague compares to earlier destructive events such as the Flood (Gen. 7) or the burning of Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen. 19)?`

`How might God’s wrath be different from our wrath?`

`Why do you think death is a necessary consequence for sin?`

`As Christians, in what ways should we keep the meaning of Passover and the memories of deliverance alive today?`

`How did Pharaoh’s defiance make the deliverance from Egypt even more incredible?`

`Can you think of other stories in the Bible or your own life where those who hate God inadvertently help His cause?`
