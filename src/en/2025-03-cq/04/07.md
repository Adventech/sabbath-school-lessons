`Why is God so particular about things we may consider insignificant, such as Moses’ failure to circumcise? (Exod. 4:24–26)`

`How much courage did it require for Moses to confront the most powerful man in the world?`

`Why do you think God had Moses ask only for time to make a three-day journey into the wilderness?`

`Why do you think God allowed things to get harder for the Israelites after Moses obeyed His command to confront Pharaoh?`

`When faced with doubts about God’s presence in your life, what has given you the strength to still believe?`

`Read Exodus 6:2–9. How does God respond to His people’s suffering? What promises does He make?`

`For those who are waiting for the Second Coming, what lessons can we learn from God’s ancient promise to deliver Israel? How will history be repeated?`

`What role do hardships play in preparing us for what God wants to do in our lives?`

`What trials are you experiencing right now? What do you think God might be preparing you for?`
