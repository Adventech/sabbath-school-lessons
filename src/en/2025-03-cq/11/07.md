`What was God’s purpose in having the Israelites build a sanctuary? (Exod. 25:8)`

`What do you think it says about our value to God that He wants to dwell in our midst?`

`Why do you think God was interested only in voluntary gifts for the sanctuary and not in anything required or forced? What does this teach about salvation? (Exod. 25:2)`

`Why was the Spirit of God needed to accomplish a construction job? What does this say about tasks that we sometimes think are ordinary? (Exod. 31:2–5)`

`How did Jesus fulfill the purpose of the sanctuary? (John 1:14)`

`Do you have a special place where you go to spend time with God—a little sanctuary, so to speak? How do you come close to God in that place?`

`Although Christian churches are not direct parallels to the Old Testament sanctuary, how can we help our churches be places where people can sense God’s presence?`

`How can we experience the purpose of the Most Holy Place today? (Exod. 25:21, 22)`
