### Learning Cycle 

#### STEP 1—Motivate 

**Spotlight on Scripture**: Ephesians 6:10–18 

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: That the battle of Armageddon is spiritual does not mean that it will be less tough and real than actual military battles: “For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places” (Eph. 6:12, NKJV). For the first time in history, all the forces of evil will gather and will reveal more fully their real faces and real intentions. The spiritual battle has a cosmic scope. Our present daily struggles will be intensified. 

**Just for Teachers**: This week’s lesson is a part of our initiation to the final battle of Armageddon. The challenge is, therefore, to inform and explain the scenario of this battle, having it in mind, while relating it to our present spiritual battles. Discuss the theme of the spiritual battle, the “great controversy” as depicted in the Scriptures. Present key texts in the Old Testament and the New Testament that refer to the spiritual battle (Numbers 24; Daniel 10–11; Matt. 26:36–42, etc.). 

**Opening Discussion**: Many evangelical Christians believe in a literal battle of Armageddon that will take place in Israel and involve real armies. Discuss the various evangelical interpretations that are popular today. 

**Questions for Discussion**: Why does a literal interpretation of Armageddon, which fits the evangelical perspective, contradict the spiritual view of the great controversy? What are the arguments against the literal interpretation of Armageddon? 

#### STEP 2—Explore 

**Just for Teachers**: The story of the Tower of Babel has remained in the memory of the biblical prophets as a paradigm for the folly of human pride. Review that story (Gen. 11:1–9) with the class. Bring a picture of the ruins of the Great Ziggurat of Ur (near Ali Air Base in Iraq). For John, Babel (or Babylon) represents the evil power that wants to take God’s place. The motif of Babylon, the Greek name for Babel, runs through the book of Revelation (it is used six times, the number associated with Babylon) and reaches its climax in the prophecy of Armageddon. Like the builders of the Tower of Babel, the evil forces gather as one to unite against the heavenly King. The great encounter ends, as in the story of the Tower of Babel, with the descent of the God of heaven and the fall of spiritual Babylon. Its fall is told in terms that recall the fall of the ancient historical Babylon. 

**Bible Commentary** 

**I. The Gathering of Babylon** (Review Revelation 16:16 and Daniel 11:43 with your class.) 

The book of Revelation refers to the last event of human history as a battle of gigantic proportions, one that “gathered . . . together” all the evil forces (Rev. 16:16), uniting the dragon and the two beasts (Rev. 16:13; compare with 12:17; 13:1, 11; see our preceding lesson). This triumvirate power drags behind them “the kings of the earth” (Rev. 16:14, NKJV). This camp is identified as “the great city” (Rev. 16:19, NKJV), a name that designates Babylon (Rev. 14:8). 

The prophet Daniel had the same vision. In his prophecy of the kingdoms (represented by a human statue), he sees at the end a great gathering of the kings of the earth (Dan. 2:43, 44). The same scenario reappears in his prophecy of the “great war” (Dan. 10:1, NIV), which concludes here also with the gathering of all the forces of the north, united with the south (Dan. 11:40). 

According to these prophecies, the last symptoms of human history will be characterized by movements of unity. It is not clear how these movements of unity will come about. It is interesting, however, that this scenario is beginning to be staged before our eyes: all the powers of the world strive for unity to make our world one on every level—one culture, religion, economy, political system, and military complex. More and more, we tend to speak the same language, dress the same way, sing the same songs, eat the same food, and even think and believe the same way. The world has never been so interrelated. It is becoming, more and more, “one global village.” 

**Consider This**: What are the world institutions that suggest the trend of global unity? What world institutions are clearly indicative of the mentality of Babylon? What world institutions could receive our approval, and why? What is your personal experience of the “global village”? 

**II. The Battle of Babylon** (Review Daniel 2:35, 45; 11:45 with your class.) 

In both of his prophecies, Daniel places the gathering of the forces of evil in opposition to the holy heavenly mountain. Likewise, the book of Revelation positions this ultimate gathering in opposition to the “temple of heaven” (Rev. 16:17, NKJV); that is, also on the holy mountain, as indicated in the prefix har (“mountain”) of the name of Armageddon. The word Mageddon, the ancient name of Megiddo, conveys the memory of many conflicts (Judges 7; 2 Kings 10:11; 2 Kings 23:29, 30). The prophecy concerns the heavenly Jerusalem and not the earthly Jerusalem of the modern state of Israel. It does not refer to military conflicts opposing earthly armies, and it has nothing to do with the Middle East conflict, as a number of evangelical Christians believe. 

The battle of Armageddon is spiritual by nature, opposing two spiritual enemies—Babylon and the heavenly Jerusalem. The camp of Babylon is represented by the three beasts: the dragon, the sea beast, and the land beast. The latter power is now called with the new name “the false prophet,” a title that confirms his role as supporter of the earthly institution of the papacy (Jer. 5:30, 31; 23:14) and as deceiver (Jer. 5:13, 23:16). The prophecy specifies that these powers use paranormal methods, the “spirits of demons,” to seduce the “kings of the earth” (Rev. 16:14, NKJV). 

**Consider This**: Look at a map to situate the city of Megiddo. How far is Mount Carmel from the city of Megiddo? How do you understand the fact that there is no Mount of Megiddo? What battles of Megiddo recorded in the Bible do you remember? Why, therefore, is it impossible to have the battle of Armageddon take place on the “mount,” or even in the valley of Megiddo? 

**III. The Fall of Babylon** (Review Daniel 2:35, 45; 11:45; and Revelation 16:17–21 with your class.) 

In the visions of Daniel, just as in the vision of John, the denouement is the same: God comes down and destroys all the gathered forces of evil. The author of the book of Revelation describes this destruction as a division of Babylon, which is called “the great city” (Rev. 16:19; compare with 14:8, NKJV). The “great gathering” has, then, been crushed, just as the great gathering of the united forces of the builders of Babel was divided by language and crushed (Gen. 11:7, 8). 

The ancient story of the fall of the historical Babylon serves as a blueprint for the future fall of the spiritual Babylon. The waters of the Euphrates are “dried up, so that the way of the kings from the east might be prepared” (Rev. 16:12, NKJV). The Bible relates the conquest of Babylon by Cyrus, in 539 b.c., to the drying up of the Euphrates: “Who says to the deep, ‘Be dry! And I will dry up your rivers’; who says of Cyrus, ‘He is My shepherd, and he shall perform all My pleasure’ ” (Isa. 44:27, 28, NKJV; Jer. 50:38). Ancient historian Herodotus (484–425 b.c.) testifies to that strategy: “[Cyrus] posted his army at the place where the river enters the city, and another part of it where the stream issues from the city, and bade his men enter the city by the channel of the Euphrates when they should see it to be fordable. . . . When this happened, the Persians who were posted with this intent made their way into Babylon by the channel of the Euphrates, which had now sunk about to the height of the middle of a man’s thigh.”—Herodotus I, Books I and II, translated by A. D. Godley (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1975), p. 239. 

**Opening Discussion**: Note the style of the past tense of the phrase “Babylon is fallen” to refer to the future event of the fall of the spiritual Babylon. 

**Questions for Discussion**: 

1. Why was the fall of Babylon so important for the Jews of that time? Who is the only pagan king who was called a messiah, and why? 
2. What are the parallels between the fall of historic Babylon and spiritual Babylon? 

#### STEP 3—Apply 

**Just for Teachers**: The Bible often refers to a well-known past event to speak about an event that has yet to take place. Identify a few examples of that biblical practice in the Old Testament, as well as in the New. 

**Application Questions**: 

1. What pedagogical lesson can be learned from this practice of referring to a well-known past event as a way to speak about an event that has not yet happened? 
2. Why does the biblical prophet use the past tense to speak about a future event? What other examples of this biblical practice do you know? 

#### STEP 4—Create 

**Just for Teachers**: The media are full of references to Armageddon. List some of them in class. 

**Activities**: If possible, select one example, such as a song, that illustrates the fascination in the media with Armageddon. Share it with the class and discuss the diverse reasons for this trend.
