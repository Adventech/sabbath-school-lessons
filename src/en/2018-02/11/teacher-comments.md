**The Lesson in Brief** 

**Key Text**: Revelation 14:9 

**The Student Will**: 

- **Know**: Learn about the meaning of the seal of God and of the mark of the beast that will characterize, respectively, God’s people and those who worship the beast in the last days of human history.
- **Feel**: Appreciate the spiritual significance of the seal as the sign of a personal and loving relationship with the God he or she worships.
- **Do**: Recommit to the Creator and Savior in order to make sure that he or she will belong to God’s camp instead of the devil’s camp. 

**Learning Outline**: 

1. Know: The Meaning of the Seal 
	+ What does the image of the “seal” represent?
	+ Why is the “mark” put on the forehead or the hand?
	+ What is the difference between the seal of God and the mark of the beast? 

2. Feel: The Essence of Worship 
	+ Why do we worship?
	+ Why is faith in Creation an expression of dependence on God?
	+ Why is Sabbath the sign of true worship? 

3. Do: Worship Is Life. 
	+ How should we observe the Sabbath to make it the sign of true worship?
	+ Why is worship more than just keeping the Sabbath on the right day?
	+ How does the keeping of the Sabbath affect our daily life? 

**Summary**: The seal of God indicates our belonging to God as our Creator and Savior and is thus a sign of life and hope. The mark of the beast, on the other hand, indicates apostasy and is therefore a sign of loss and death. 

### Learning Cycle 

#### STEP 1—Motivate 

**Spotlight on Scripture**: Ephesians 1:12–14 

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: The seal of God is a whole process that involves the work of the Holy Spirit confirming that we “trusted . . . the word of truth” (Eph. 1:13, NKJV). This means that the seal is not a magical and arbitrary badge. As with circumcision or baptism, the seal of God is a sign of the covenant between God and His people. This sign reflects an internal state of holiness and relates to the life of faith. The sign is seen in the hearts of God’s people, in the intimacy of their thoughts and sentiments; it speaks about their love for God. It is also seen in the dynamic of their actions, which express the genuineness of their responses to God. 

**Just for Teachers**: This week’s lesson is a part of our preparation for the final struggles that will distinguish between two camps: the righteous and the wicked. The challenge is, therefore, to inform and explain the meaning and the significance of the sign that will identify the righteous (the seal of God), and the sign that will reveal the wicked (the mark of the beast). Examine the role of the Sabbath in that process. 

**Opening Discussion**: Some Christians interpret the mark of the beast literally, for instance, as a bar code, a credit card number, or as some biometric identification. Find a representative of each of these three literal interpretations, and identify the arguments supporting them. 

**Questions for Discussion**: Why do these literal applications of the mark of the beast contradict the spiritual and symbolical perspective of the book of Revelation? What are the clues in the biblical text that suggest a spiritual application of the mark of the beast instead? 

#### STEP 2—Explore 

**Just for Teachers**: John, the prophet of the book of Revelation, uses a series of images and notions that he borrows from the Old Testament to suggest a striking contrast between those who receive the seal of God as a sign of their belonging to Him and those who receive the mark of the beast as a sign of their allegiance to the beast. Decode the symbolic language, and discuss the following questions: 

1. What is the meaning of receiving the mark “on the forehead or the hand”? 
2. What does this procedure imply in regard to the relationship with the beast? 
3. What lessons do these images suggest about the crucial issue of worship? 
4. What is the place of the Sabbath in this drama that will take place at the end of time? 
5. How is the Sabbath related to the seal of God and the mark of the beast? 


**Bible Commentary** 

**I. The Seal of God** (Review Revelation 7:1–4, 9:4 with your class.) 

In the context of the vision of the seven seals (Rev. 6:1–8:1)—immediately after the sixth seal, which opens with the wrath of God (Rev. 6:17)—the prophet John sees the “seal of God,” which marks those who will survive the wrath of God (Rev. 7:3). This particular seal contrasts with the other seven seals. While the seven seals bring a message of destruction and death, this seal carries the promise of salvation and life. Also, while the other seals signify the idea of confidentiality, this one indicates ownership. 

The ancients often placed a seal on merchandise to attest that it belonged to them. This seal consisted of a piece of metal or a precious stone (Exod. 28:11, Esther 8:8) wherein the name of the owner or a symbol representing him was engraved. The seal was designed to be pressed on the clay that closed the document or the merchandise. In John’s prophetic vision, the seal is put on the foreheads to save God’s people from the forthcoming disasters (Rev. 7:3, 9:4). The prophet Ezekiel refers to the same protective function of the mark on the forehead (Ezek. 9:4–6; compare with Gen. 4:15). In this passage in Ezekiel, the seal marks only those who worship the living God, the Creator, to distinguish from those who “were worshiping the sun toward the east” (Ezek. 8:16, NKJV). 

The vision of Revelation 7 conveys the same meaning. It contains a sequence that hearkens back to the Creation account. In fact, the sequence “the earth, the sea, or the trees” (Rev. 7:3, NKJV) is the same as in the Creation story itself (compare with Gen. 1:9–13). Thus, the mention of this sequence points to the fact that the seal marks those who recognize God as their Creator, those who belong to Him (Ps. 24:1, 2; 89:12, 13; 100:3). To be sealed by God means that we, and everything we have and are, belongs to Him, the One who created everything. 

**Consider This**: What is the visible evidence that God’s people have received the “seal of God”? 

**II. The Mark of the Beast** (Review Revelation 13:15, 16; 14:9 with your class.) 

To compete with God and confuse humans, the enemy of God, represented by “the beast,” has also produced his own mark as a sign of allegiance. The book of Revelation describes this mark as being stamped on the right hand or on the forehead (Rev. 13:16). This symbol has been borrowed from the book of Deuteronomy, in which it symbolizes faithfulness to the law of God. To ensure that the children of Israel do not forget to keep the words of God and His commandments in their hearts, God resorts to an image: “ ‘You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as front-lets between your eyes’ ” (Deut. 6:8, NKJV; compare with Exod. 13:9). Still, today, Jews apply this mnemonic device literally and bind the tefillin (“phylacteries”) on the hand and on the forehead to remind themselves of their total submission to the law of God, involving both action (the hand) and thinking (forehead). 

Just as the “seal of God” on the forehead is a sign that reminds God’s people to submit themselves to His commandments, the “mark of the beast” on the hand or on the forehead is a sign of commitment that characterizes the beast’s followers. In fact, as the third angel specifies, it is the issue of worship that is at stake here. The warning “ ‘if anyone worships the beast’ ” is explained in the parallel statement “ ‘and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand’ ” (Rev. 14:9, NKJV). The Greek conjunction kai, “and,” that introduces this statement corresponds to the Hebrew waw of explanation (epexegetical), signifying the direct connection between worshiping the beast and receiving its mark. 

**Consider This**: Why is the “mark of the beast” a sign of worship? Compare the “mark of the beast” and the “seal of God.” Why is worship the crucial issue of the final phase of the great controversy? 

**III. The Sabbath, Sign of Worship** (Review Genesis 2:1–3 and Exodus 20:8–11 with your class.) 

Human history began on Sabbath, a time of worship. The Sabbath marks, therefore, the first human worship in history—indeed, the first human response to God’s gift of Creation. It is also significant that the Sabbath, which refers to Creation, occupies the geographic center of the Decalogue. This occupation is also true thematically: the Sabbath refers to both our relationship with God (as do commandments 1 to 3) and our relationship with our fellow humans (as do commandments 5 to 10). 

It is interesting that in ancient covenant documents, the seal was placed in the center to make sure that no one could manipulate or erase the agreement. The place of the Sabbath in the center of the Decalogue is an indication that it was intended to be the seal of the Creator. (See lesson 6, step 2, section III, entitled A Sign of the Times.) 

**Questions for Discussion**: 

1. The Sabbath is one of the commandments of the Decalogue that has been challenged (and changed) in traditional Christianity. Why has the Sabbath commandment been, and still is being, challenged? 
2. How did the change of the Sabbath affect the relationship between Christians and Jews? 

#### STEP 3—Apply 

**Just for Teachers**: The seventh-day Sabbath refers to Creation, according to the fourth commandment, while the Sunday of Roman Catholic tradition refers to resurrection. Discuss with your class how these two different explanations for which day to observe have affected their respective ways of thinking. 

**Application Questions**: 

1. How should we keep the Sabbath in our families to make it meaningful and to reflect its function as the seal of God? 
2. What is the difference between what is done on Sunday by other Christians and what is done by Seventh-day Adventists on the Sabbath? 

#### STEP 4—Create 

**Just for Teachers**: Observe and analyze the worship services in your church and compare them with worship services in other churches or religions. Discuss the meaning of worship with your class. 

**Activities**: Prepare a liturgical service for Sabbath that will express the Seventh-day Adventist theology of worship.
