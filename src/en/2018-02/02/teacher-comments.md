**The Lesson in Brief** 

**Key Text**: Daniel 1:20 

**The Student Will**: 

- **Know**: Recognize his or her responsibility as a witness to God in the world.
- **Feel**: Foster love and respect toward others and inspire the same from them.
- **Do**: Remain faithful to God and to himself or herself without compromise. 

**Learning Outline**: 

1. Know: You Shall Be Witnesses to the End of the Earth. 
	+ Why was Daniel a witness?
	+ In what ways was Daniel a witness?
	+ How did the chief of the eunuchs respond to Daniel’s testimony? 

2. Feel: To Love God Is to Love Man. 
	+ Explain Jesus’ call to hate one’s parents (Luke 14:26). 
	+ How can you show love to your parents or your friends who do not believe in God? 
	+ Why is the witness for truth who loves, and is loved, more effective than the witness who is concerned only with the truth? 

3. Do: To Be Human and Holy 
	+ How can I keep the balance between the duty to be faithful to God’s commandments and my relationship with my friends and family who do not share my values? 
	+ Why is it not possible to truly love people without being holy? 

**Summary**: The example of Jesus, who became human without making any compromise, is a challenging model for the Christian and especially the Seventh-day Adventist who lives in the world. 

#### Learning Cycle 

##### STEP 1—Motivate 

**Spotlight on Scripture**: Daniel 1:15, 17 

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: God wants His people to share with the world the truth of His kingdom. The question that often confronts us in fulfilling that mandate concerns the methods we should use to communicate that truth. In the book of Daniel, we learn that the truth is related to the form that channels it. The literary forms of a given book often express its profoundest and richest message. Daniel himself embodied this principle. His personal relationship with people around him, the way he approached them, the way he ate and drank, even the way he presented himself, was not dissociated from the spiritual message he carried. 

**Just for Teachers**: This week’s lesson will teach us how to be witnesses in a world that is far from God and even hostile to Him. Like Daniel, we are in exile, testifying to a kingdom that is not visible and is not popular. We will learn from the examples of Daniel and his three friends, who stood faithful to their God while serving the king. We will learn about the challenges they met in their secular context and their methods of witnessing. We will also learn about their spiritual lives and the way they were able to bring their hope concretely into their daily lives. 

**Opening Discussion**: The book of Daniel is particularly important for Seventh-day Adventists; and yet, this book contains some of the truths that make us different from most people (including other Christians) and, in some respects, make us unique in our society. Unfortunately, this book has attracted extremists on the religious fringe. The paradox is that the book of Daniel is one of the most universal books of the Bible. It brings the only hope that people need, especially in our day. 

**Questions for Discussion**: 

Why is the book of Daniel often ignored? ® What is the message of hope that comes from the book of Daniel? 

##### STEP 2—Explore 

**Just for Teachers**: As Seventh-day Adventists, we often assume we know the book of Daniel well. To avoid repeating old clichés, suggest to the students of this lesson that they approach the book of Daniel as if for the first time. They should aim to refresh their reading of the book and discover new insights and new paths into its prophecies. Such discovery and rich insight are implicitly promised to those reading it in the last days, because the book is described as remaining sealed until the time of the end (Dan. 12:9). 

**Bible Commentary** 

**I. To Be Loved by the Enemy** (Review Daniel 1:9 with your class.) 

When Daniel determined to remain faithful to God, a miracle took place: “God gave Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the chief of the eunuchs” (Dan. 1:9, ESV). It is interesting that God inspired love and respect in the heart of the enemy immediately after Daniel decided not to compromise. 

This verse suggests two lessons. First, God did not make a miracle happen before Daniel and the three Hebrews risked their lives. Thus, Daniel did not suddenly find perfect meals on his table before the test of his loyalty to God. Although God may sometimes facilitate our walk with Him and “guideth [us] in straight paths” (Ps. 23:3, JPS), in many cases, the reality is that life, more often than not, confronts us with situations that oppose our principles. 

Second, to be faithful to God does not mean treating unkindly the men and women of the world. Although Daniel decided to be different and to refuse the invitation of the king, he remained respectful and pleasant to the chief of the eunuchs, and he approached him with humility (Dan. 1:8, 12). It is also intriguing that the verse does not refer to Daniel’s love and respect toward his master. It is not enough to love our enemies; we should also inspire love in their hearts, which is evidence that our love is genuine. 

**Consider This**: Why do our neighbors’ positive feelings toward us often provide the most fertile ground from which to witness to those same neighbors? 

**II. The Silent Witness** (Review Daniel 3:26–28; 2:11, 21 with your class.) 

The most eloquent testimony of one’s faith in God is the life one leads. The three Hebrews’ only testimony was their survival from the fire of the furnace. Note that they did not draw attention to themselves. They did not even speak. The text simply tells us that they “came from the midst of the fire” (Dan. 3:26, NKJV). The focus was on God. This lesson is the primary one that Nebuchadnezzar retained from that dramatic miracle: “ ‘Blessed be the God . . . who . . . delivered His servants’ ” (Dan. 3:28, NKJV). The reference to the witness was secondary: “ ‘who trusted in Him’ ” (Dan. 3:28, NKJV). And even then, the stress is on “Him.” This case illustrates the method of witnessing that is promoted in the book of Daniel. It is not about oneself but about God. The three Hebrews did not boast about themselves (“Look what God has done for me!”). God alone received the glory (1 Cor. 1:31). 

**Consider This**: Think of a time that you felt frustrated that someone was rewarded for work you had done, or that his or her work, which was less important than yours, received recognition, while yours was ignored. How did that experience make you feel? Meditate and discuss with the class this issue within the framework of Ecclesiastes 9:11. 

**III. Worship at Stake** (Review Daniel 3:7, 8:11 with your class.) 

Precisely because Daniel lives in exile (far from Jerusalem) and serves in a pagan court, the issue of “worship” is central to the book of Daniel. This issue already is obvious in the first test of faithfulness, which involves eating and drinking. It is highly significant that Daniel alludes to a verse of the biblical text of Creation when he is concerned with his food (Dan. 1:12; compare with Gen. 1:29). 

The second test of faithfulness takes place when the Israelites are commanded to worship the golden statue that the king has erected. The golden statue that Nebuchadnezzar has “set up” refers back to the statue of his dream, which concluded with the divine promise that God will “set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed” (Dan. 2:44). In Nebuchadnezzar’s mind the kingdom of Babylon has thus replaced the kingdom of God. This ideology reminds us of the foolishness of the builders of the Tower of Babel, who wanted to take God’s place (Gen. 11:4). Further into the book of Daniel, the “little horn” (Dan. 8:9) and the “king of the North” (Dan. 11:16, NKJV) will display the same mentality (Dan. 8:11, 11:31). In counterpoint to these cases of false worship, the book of Daniel is punctuated with seven prayers by Daniel, the three Hebrews, and King Nebuchadnezzar. The book of Daniel ends with a blessing (Dan. 12:12), a feature that is specific to many biblical prayers (Ps. 1:1, 119:1, Rev. 1:3). 

**Consider This**: On the basis of the text of Daniel 3, list the characteristics of false worship and true worship. How does music play a role in false worship? How is prayer related to the study of God’s Word (Dan. 9:2, 3)? 

##### STEP 3—Apply 

**Just for Teachers**: It is troubling how our times of advanced knowledge and skepticism have been associated with naïve superstitions and all kinds of strange beliefs. On the other hand, the rise of religious fanaticism has produced violence and generated illusions and entertained false certitudes and hopes. Having rejected the true God of heaven, humans search in themselves for a solution to their tragic conditions. 

**Application Questions**: 

- Apply the principles we’ve learned thus far from the book of Daniel to the situation of our times and discuss the following questions: 
- Why is the book of Daniel relevant to our times? Why is the issue of eating and drinking an important issue? 
- What is the prophetic significance of the little horn’s claim for worship? How can we communicate this difficult denunciation from the book of Daniel without alienating people? 

##### STEP 4—Create 

**Just for Teachers**: There are many common points, as well as differences, between the time of Daniel and our time. In the time of Daniel, people were fundamentally religious; and yet, they were pagans. Today, people are not pagans, but they are not religious. How can we cope with this difference? Why are many people suspicious of churches and the Christian faith? What lessons could we learn from Daniel to help us to deal with these powerful movements? 

**Activities**: 

- Divide your class into seven groups, if possible, and assign one prayer of Daniel to each group. (Where classes are smaller in number, assign multiple prayers to each group.) Instruct each group to note what impressed them the most in that prayer. Then invite these groups to report on and compare reactions. 
- Why is it often difficult to reach powerful, wealthy, or highly educated people? (Focus on the issue of our method of communication rather than on blaming them to justify our inabilities.) Why was Daniel able to reach the powerful and the highly educated? And what can you take away from his methods?
