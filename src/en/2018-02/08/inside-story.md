#### ‘House on Fire’

*By Andrew McChesney, Adventist Mission*

Dan Frein, a utilities company manager in the U.S. state of Michigan, stopped attending the Protestant church of his youth for about 20 years. His wife, raised in a Seventh-day Adventist home, also wasn’t an active church member.

But the day came that Dan wanted to return to church, so he walked into his former church on a Sunday morning. What he saw and heard surprised him. This was not the church that he had left. He found that the church now endorsed homosexuality and other nonbiblical practices that it had preached against two decades earlier.

Disappointed, Dan told his wife that he longed to find a church that followed the Bible. His wife remembered the Adventist church in the nearby town of Muskegon, where her parents were members.

The couple began to attend worship services with her parents. At the same time, Dan read every Ellen White book that he could find.

On a Tuesday night after prayer meeting, he stopped the pastor in the parking lot.

“I want to let you know that I am ready”, he said.

“Ready for what?” asked the pastor.

“I am ready to be baptized”, Dan said. “I’ve been reading Ellen White’s books. I am ready and I am on board”.

The pastor went through baptismal studies and found that Dan did know and agree with the church’s teachings. Dan was baptized, his wife was rebaptized, and their son was also baptized.

“I praise the Lord that Dan came in despite our lack of personal outreach”, said the pastor, Kameron DeVasher. “I know that personal ministries work and evangelism are absolutely not dead. But I have a feeling that there are a lot more Dans out there, just waiting to be gathered in”.

He said Dan’s experience also speaks of the importance of Ellen White’s books. “I think that there is power in the Spirit of Prophecy, so we should feel no shame in sharing those books”, he said.

As for Dan, he has led multiple evangelistic campaigns at the church, served as a deacon, and participated in prison ministries. Members describe him as “a house on fire”.

“This is a person who has been in the church less than five years, and he is preaching the Word and winning souls”, Pastor DeVasher said. “He reminds us that the work of the local church is first and foremost evangelism, winning souls, and discipleship, and every member should have a part in that work”.
