### Learning Cycle 

#### STEP 1—Motivate 

**Spotlight on Scripture**: Hebrews 9:11–14 

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: The great model of Christ, praying for the salvation of the world, obliges me to join Him in prayer to implore God’s kingdom to come. 

**Just for Teachers**: The contemplation of Christ’s ministry in the heavenly sanctuary will increase our sensitivity to the atrocity of sin and awaken our responsibility for our neighbors. Salvation is a process that concerns the world; the salvation of the individual is related to the salvation of the world. 

**Opening Discussion**: Christ’s intercessory ministry in behalf of sinners is one of our most challenging doctrines, not only because it concerns the heavenly realm, but also because our understanding of it makes us almost unique among Christians and other believers. It is not enough to repeat that this topic is important. We should learn to think about the meaning and the significance of this process that takes place in heaven and concerns our personal destiny and the destiny of the world. Engage with your class in a frank discussion of Christ’s high-priestly work, searching for ways to make this topic clear, convincing, and relevant. 

**Questions for Discussion**: 

- Why is Jesus’ ministry in heaven important? Find biblical stories or passages that underscore the connection between heaven and earth (for example, the ladder of Bethel, in Genesis 28:12). 
- According to Daniel, what is the difference between the God of Israel and the gods of the Chaldeans? (See Dan. 2:10, 11, 28.) 
- Why is Christ’s intercessory ministry in heaven so crucial—not only for us as Seventh-day Adventists, but also for the destiny of the world? Why are other Christians largely inattentive to this aspect of Christ’s ministry? How can we translate and communicate this message to postmodern minds? 

#### STEP 2—Explore 

**Just for Teachers**: This lesson will cover the three main phases of Christ’s ministry: (1) His sacrifice as the Passover Lamb, (2) His high-priestly ministry in heaven, and (3) the eschatological Day of Atonement. Be sure to avoid merely enunciating this point of doctrine; instead, approach it with creativity and the urgent sense of its existential and historical relevance. Relate your presentation and discussion to the crises of our church, concerning the sanctuary doctrine (the Great Disappointment of our pioneers, false teachers, and the havoc wrecked by their theories within our ranks, etc.). Discuss and address their mistakes. Although our views are not accepted by many Christians, show that Adventists are not alone in holding this apocalyptic reading; other religious traditions (Jewish and Muslim) attest to the same emphasis. 

**Bible Commentary** 

**I. The Lamb of God** (Review John 1:29 with your class.) 

The sacrifice of the lamb at Passover was a “type,” pointing to the sacrifice of Christ. It is thanks to the blood of this lamb that the angel of death “passed over” the doors of the Israelite houses, thus preparing for the Exodus salvation (Exod. 12:13, 14). Along the same lines, Isaiah compares the atoning “lamb” to the Suffering Servant, who will save the world by taking their sins on Himself (Isa. 53:7; compare with Acts 8:32). 

The same association of thoughts is found in the New Testament. Luke uses the word “decease,” or exodus in Greek, to refer to Jesus’ death (Luke 9:31), thus alluding to the spiritually liberating and redemptive effect of His death. Yet, when John the Baptist identified Jesus as “the Lamb of God,”he added to the Passover lamb another surprising dimension: divinity. For this Lamb was of a divine character. The phrase “lamb of God” means in Hebrew grammar “the divine lamb.” For John, God had become this Lamb that was sacrificed at Passover. Significantly, the “lamb” is the most important and most frequent symbol in the book of Revelation, where it appears from the beginning to the end (Rev. 5:6, 22:3, etc.). To save humankind, the great God of the universe identified Himself with the most vulnerable victim. 

**Consider This**: In light of Jesus’ statement in Luke 9:22, discuss the following questions: 

1. Why was it necessary for God to die for our sins? 
2. Couldn’t it have been possible for God to forgive our sins without having to die on the cross? Explain. 
3.What is the logical explanation for the sacrifice of Christ? 

**II. The Priest Forever** (Review Psalm 110 and Hebrews 7:20–28 with your class.) 

Paradoxically, Jesus is identified not only as the “lamb” that is sacrificed; He is also identified as the priest who slaughters the lamb. The author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, following Psalm 110, compares Jesus to Melchizedek “a priest forever” (Heb. 7:21, NKJV; compare with Ps. 110:4), a way of affirming the everlasting and universal scope of the priesthood of Christ (Heb. 7:24). The author of Hebrews refers here to the priestly function of Christ in heaven. According to this new covenant, salvation and forgiveness are no longer limited in time and in space; they are available now to everyone and have a permanent effect. 

That the divine priesthood, located in heaven, is in the hands of the eternal Son of God has tremendous significance. It means that we have now direct access to God and do not need to offer sacrifices. But more important, it means that Jesus’ priesthood has an effect on the history of the whole world: Jesus’ priesthood in heaven concerns the preparation for the heavenly kingdom of God. Jesus’ sacrifice has, at the cross, replaced the old Levitical sacrifices and thus moved the process of forgiveness and salvation to heaven. Now, the new horizon is cosmic and aims at the future kingdom of God in heaven. 

**Consider This**: Why did the priestly intercession move from earth to heaven? Explain why the event of the Cross does not complete the process of salvation. Why did Stephen see Jesus “ ‘at the right hand of God’ ” in heaven (Acts 7:56, NKJV; compare with Ps. 110:1)? What does this vision mean in regard to the new covenant (Dan. 9:27)? 

**III. The Day of Atonement in Heaven** (Review Hebrews 9:26–28 and Daniel 8:14 with your class.) 

The last phase of the process of salvation is represented by the author of Hebrews and by biblical prophecy as a day of judgment/Atonement (in Hebrew kippur). After referring to the sacrifice of Christ, whose function was to “put away sin” (Heb. 9:26, NKJV; compare with Dan. 9:24), the author of Hebrews clearly refers to that event of “judgment,” which he parallels to the Second Coming: “As it is appointed for men to die once, but after this the judgment, so Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many. . . . He will appear a second time, apart from sin, for salvation” (Heb. 9:27, 28, NKJV). 

For the author of Hebrews, just as human death parallels Christ’s death, the judgment parallels Jesus’ second coming. The book of Daniel projects the same historical trajectory. While the 70-weeks prophecy leads to the sacrifice of Christ (Dan. 9:26), the 2,300-evenings-and-mornings prophecy leads to the day of judgment or the Day of Atonement at the end of time, just before the coming of the Son of man (Dan. 8:14; compare with Dan. 7:9–14). God’s plan of salvation did not stop at the cross. The prophecy refers also to the Day of Atonement/judgment in heaven that should mark the time of the end, just before Jesus’ coming. 

The additional event of the pre-Advent judgment may come as a surprise to many Christians. Yet, this event is a very important and crucial step in the process of salvation. For it is this event that finally opens to the kingdom of God, the ultimate historical manifestation of salvation. It is particularly significant that biblical prophecy describes this special moment in terms of the Day of Atonement. Just as the Levitical Day of Atonement was needed by “all the people” (Lev. 16:33; compare with verse 17), in order that “all their sins” might be atoned (Lev. 16:34, NKJV), this final Day of Atonement is made necessary for the salvation of the world. The message of the Day of Atonement is that salvation is essentially a cosmic event. Salvation cannot take place unless there is a “new heaven and a new earth” (Rev. 21:1, NKJV; compare with Isa. 65:17). 

**Discussion Question**: Why are the Cross and the judgment two complementary events? 

#### STEP 3—Apply 

**Just for Teachers**: Why is the biblical truth of the judgment often difficult to understand and teach? Compare it with other important truths, such as scientific truths (physics, medicine, etc.). Why is it necessary that some of these truths be difficult to grasp? 

**Application Question**: How could we communicate the important and profound truth of the judgment to people of today? 

#### STEP 4—Create 

**Just for Teachers**: An important lesson we learned this week is the sophistication and beauty of God’s work in the salvation of the world. The complexity of this lesson suggests just how serious God’s work and attention are in this matter. 

**Activities**: Expose various ideologies that have been put forth to save the world (socialism, liberalism, absolutism, anarchism, etc.). Why did all these propositions fail? Why is the creation of a new world the only solution to the problem of the world? Why, and how, does the biblical truth of the eschatological Day of Atonement respond to that question?
