Read the following texts, which have various names for Jesus in them and in some cases descriptions of Him and what He has done, is doing, or will do. What do the texts teach us about Jesus?

`Rev. 1:5`

`Rev. 1:18`

`Rev. 5:8`

`Rev. 19:11-15`

`Rev. 21:6`

These are only a few of the many texts in Revelation that depict Jesus in various roles and functions. He is the Lamb, which points to His first coming, in which He offered Himself as a sacrifice for our sins. “Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us” (1 Cor. 5:7). He was also the One who “was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore” (Rev. 1:18), a clear reference to His death and resurrection from the dead. “Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead the third day” (Luke 24:46, ASV). And in Revelation 19:11-15, He is depicted in His role at the Second Coming, when He will return to the earth in power and glory and judgment. “For the Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will reward each according to his works” (Matt. 16:27, NKJV).

`How can we learn day by day to make the life, death, resurrection, and the return of Jesus the central focus of our own existence and the foundation for the moral choices we make?`
