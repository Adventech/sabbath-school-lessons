#### Learning Cycle 

##### STEP 1—Motivate 

**Spotlight on Scripture**: Revelation 1:3 

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: The key to the book of Revelation does not depend solely on your ability and your skills to unlock its symbols. It also lies in the way in which you respond to God’s calling in this book to repent and serve the Lord. Conversely, your good intentions to be pious and to please the Lord should be enlightened and guided by your diligent and attentive study of the Word of God. 

**Just for Teachers**: From the outset, the book of Revelation outlines the methodological principles that should characterize any approach to this book. We are urged to “read,” “hear,” and “keep.” Reading is the first and fundamental step. The truth is not found in ourselves; it has to be found in a text that has been inspired by God. It is defined as a “prophecy” to be “heard.” 

In Hebrew, the verb “hear” has a double meaning; it first means “understand” (1 Kings 3:9, Neh. 8:3, Rev. 2:7), which implies that our intelligence, our intellectual effort, is required. But “hear” also means “obey,” which implies that we should be willing to turn our understanding into actions and respond to God positively. The third verb “keep” reminds us that spiritual life is a continuous and repetitive process: we must maintain, fresh in our minds and hearts, what we have read and heard. Hence, the repetition of this principle at the end of the book (Rev. 22:7). 

**Opening Discussion**: Note that the first verb, “read,” is in the singular, while the other two verbs are in the plural: implicit in the grammar is the idea that there is one reader and several listeners. The multiplicity of listeners, included without question in the plural form, suggests that the book of Revelation belongs to a worship context. Thus, we should not read it alone. Discuss with your students what principles and truths this worship, and collective, setting implies. 

**Questions for Discussion**: 

- Why is it important to read the book of Revelation in the company of like-minded seekers of the truth? 
- What skills and emotions does this group reading imply? 

##### STEP 2—Explore 

**Just for Teachers**: Three fundamental requirements should prepare the students of your class to engage and stay on the right track in deciphering the book of Revelation: (1) the important connection of the book of Revelation with the Old Testament, and in particular, with the book of Daniel; (2) the general structure of the book; and (3) the focus on the Person of Jesus Christ. 

**Bible Commentary** 

**I. The Most Hebrew Book of the New Testament** (Review Revelation 1:4 and Exodus 3:14 with your class.) 

The book of Revelation could be considered the book of the New Testament closest to the Old Testament. We may count 2,000 allusions to the Old Testament, including 400 explicit references and 90 quotations of the Pentateuch and the Prophets. This book is so anchored in Hebrew that it has been said that it can “barely be understood by anyone who isn’t proficient in Hebrew.” John opens his message to the seven churches with a greeting originating in the God of the Old Testament. The shalom comes from “Him who is,” a phrase that defines the God Yahweh, who reveals Himself to Moses at the burning bush (Exod. 3:14, NKJV). 

But the book that is by far the most present in Revelation is the book of Daniel. The first word of the book, “revelation,” is a keyword of the book of Daniel, where it also introduces his prophetic visions (Dan. 2:19, 28, 29, 30, 47; 10:1). The book of Revelation begins the way that Daniel ends, with a blessing, as if Revelation were understood by John to be Daniel’s continuation. The book of Daniel ends with a blessing that is rooted in the waiting that points to “the end of the days” (Dan. 12:12, 13, NKJV), and the book of Revelation begins with a blessing that has the same horizon, “for the time is near” (Rev. 1:3, NKJV). Even the way John refers to himself to introduce his vision, “I, John” (Rev. 1:9, NKJV), echoes Daniel’s technical expression “I, Daniel” that is used in the context of his visions (Dan. 7:15; 8:15, 27; 9:2; 10:2, 7; 12:5, NKJV). All these observations in the first verses of the book of Revelation should encourage us to study the book in close connection to the Old Testament and to the book of Daniel. 

**Consider This**: What are the dangers of reading and studying the New Testament without taking into consideration its relationship to the Old Testament? How did the Christian church fail in this area? Why was the book of Daniel the most popular book of the early Christians? What greeting did the early Christians create from their reading of the book of Daniel? 

**II. The Illuminating Structure** (Review Revelation 11:19–14:5 with your class.) 

Like the book of Daniel, the book of Revelation is divided into two sections, and like the book of Daniel, the book of Revelation places at its center God’s judgment in the end times and the coming of the Son of man (Revelation 14; compare with Daniel 7). The first part of the book of Revelation focuses on the history on earth from the time of John to the coming of Christ, while the second part of the book focuses on the history in heaven from the time of the coming of Christ to the descent of the heavenly Jerusalem. 

In addition to this division into two parts, the structure of the book of Revelation relates also to the space and the times of the sanctuary. The space of the sanctuary is suggested by the progression of the apocalyptic vision from the sacrifice of Christ, which evokes the altar (Rev. 1:5); to the candlestick, which evokes the first apartment of the sanctuary, the “holy place” (Rev. 1:10–18); and then to the ark of the covenant, which evokes the second apartment of the sanctuary, the “most holy place” (Rev. 11:19). The times of the sanctuary are suggested by the allusions to the seven Jewish festivals that mark the rhythm of the progression of the vision, from Passover (Rev. 1:12–20) to the Feast of Tabernacles (Rev. 21:1–8). This multifold structure of the book of Revelation accounts for the rich and meaningful message that is conveyed there. 

**Consider This**: What lessons may we infer from the connection between the sanctuary and the various parts of the book of Revelation? Why is the event of God’s judgment located at the center of the books of Revelation and of Daniel? (Compare with the function of Leviticus 16 at the center of the Pentateuch.) 

**III. Christ at the Center** (Review Revelation 1:5, 18; 3:21 with your class.) 

Jesus is present everywhere in the book of Revelation. He appears in the beginning to identify the essence of the book, “the Revelation of Jesus Christ” (Rev. 1:1), and to trace its very origin “from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead” (Rev. 1:5, NKJV). And He appears at the end of the book in the concluding grace (Rev. 22:20), in which we hear Him, again, as a witness speaking of His coming and in which we receive His grace in the meantime (Rev. 22:20, 21). Inside the book, the various aspects of Jesus Christ’s ministry are referred to, namely, His role as the Passover lamb, which provides salvation; His survival from death; His role as the One who walks within His church; and His final victory on the white horse as a glorious king (Rev. 19:11–16). 

**Consider This**: Why is Jesus Christ central to the book of Revelation? What is the most important symbol that is used in the book of Revelation to represent Jesus Christ? 

##### STEP 3—Apply 

**Just for Teachers**: The book of Revelation is full of blood and seems to present God as a vengeful God. How can we reconcile these cruel descriptions with the notion of a good and loving God? Luther rejected the book of Revelation. How might such perceptions of violence have contributed toward his rejection? What important ethical lesson can we learn from the book of Revelation? Why is it important to know that God will judge humankind? 

**Application Question**: Why, and how, should the book of Revelation affect your life? 

##### STEP 4—Create 

**Just for Teachers**: The book of Revelation has often inspired fanaticism, perhaps, because it is read too often in isolation from other parts of the Bible. Why is it not wise to read the book of Revelation by itself? What other books of the Bible should be read along with the book of Revelation? 

**Activities**: 

- Ask members of your class to search out the various symbols in the book of Revelation. 
- Discuss with them their meaning and their relation to the symbols of the Old Testament.
