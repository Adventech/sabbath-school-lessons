#### Full Circle

*By Brittany Fletcher*

A young man came up to me as I was taking out the trash on New Year’s Eve at my home in the U.S. state of Kentucky.

“I have a survey here that might help the community”, he said. “Would you take it?”

The friendly stranger turned out to be a GYC volunteer attending the Seventh-day Adventist youth organization’s annual convention in Louisville. Little did I know that I would be going door-to-door at the next GYC convention a year later.

Outside my home, I looked at the survey that the GYC volunteer had handed me. I circled my interest in Bible studies and visitation. Then I heard nothing for five months.

In May, my mother told me that someone had come to the house for Bible studies. The man visited six times. I missed him every time because of my university classes. In June, the man, a Bible worker named Ramone, came when I was at home, and we arranged to study the Bible at a local cafe every Friday.

I knew nothing about Adventism. I was active in another denomination, where I taught the children and went on mission trips. But I was not getting the connection with Jesus that I desired. I prayed constantly to grow closer to Him.

My prayers were answered with Romone.

Soon I texted Romone that I wanted to meet twice a week. I accepted everything that I learned. As my diet and lifestyle changed, my life began to improve. I love Romans 12:2, which says, “And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God” (NKJV).

This heavenly mindset broadened my mindset. Now when I study, I am not hoping for a good grade but I am learning for God. I want the knowledge to provide healing to people as a speech therapist one day.

At Romone’s church, I learned about the GYC convention in Houston, Texas, in December 2016. I joined the Adventist Church shortly before the convention began.

Going door-to-door with GYC volunteers was exciting. Several people signed up for Bible studies. I saw the same passion in a young man that I had had a year earlier. I am praying that the story will come full circle with him, just as it did with me. I know the power of one survey.
