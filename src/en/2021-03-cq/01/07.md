`How do you see examples of traditionalism and its impact on sexuality?`

`How do you see examples of changing trends of sexuality?`

`Where are areas that the scripts of society clash with the scripts of Scripture?`

`How have you dealt with this dissonance in the past? Does this make you more resolved or more reticent?`
