  title: "Principles of Biblical Sexuality"
  description: "Why is “the church” so bothered about sex? For one thing, the Bible contains many narratives and teachings regarding sexuality. In the primary religious text for Christianity, sexuality is inescapable. Second, in recent years, because of the various approaches in understanding and interpreting the Bible, some Christian denominations have taken several eyebrow-raising stances on diverse sexual issues. After understanding sexuality from the entire Bible and only the Bible, we can see that some of these stances are quite erroneous, if not dangerous in their ramifications! Last, sexuality is so much a part of the human experience that any serious believer will want to understand what the Bible has to say about it."
