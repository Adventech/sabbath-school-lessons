> “This is what the LORD said, ‘The time is coming when I will make a new agreement with the family of Israel and with the family of Judah’ ” (Jeremiah 31:31, ERV).

A CARTOON IN A MAGAZINE years ago showed a top businessman in an office. The businessman stood in front of a group of other top business leaders. The man held a box of laundry soap in his hands. He showed the box of soap to the other men and women there in the office. The man told the men and women to look at the word “NEW” that was written in large red letters on the box. This word showed that the laundry soap was new. The man said, “The only thing new is the word ‘NEW’ on the box.” Everything else about the soap was the same.

We can say the same thing about the new agreement. The reason for the new agreement is the same as the old agreement. The hope that the new agreement gives us is the same. So are the things in the new agreement that God asks us to do. Both agreements show us the mercy and loving favor of God. The love of God for humans is stronger than any sin we ask Him to forgive or mistake that we make.
