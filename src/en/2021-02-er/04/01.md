> “ ‘I will make My agreement between Me and you and your children after you through their whole lives for all time, I will be God to you and to your children’s children after you’ ” Genesis 17:7, NLV.

DO YOU REMEMBER A TIME during your childhood when you were sick? Maybe you had a cold or flu. Or maybe you were sick with something else that will make you feel worse. You wake up during the night with an awful fever. Then you see your mother or father sitting in a chair next to your bed in the soft glow of the night-light.

Humans who live on this earth after the Flood are the same as a sick child. At that time, sin and evil start to grow again in human hearts. God is the same as a parent who sits by His sick child. God has a plan to make humans well. He chooses Abram to start a family group who will teach other people about God and His plan to save humans.

God makes an agreement with Abram and his future children. The agreement shows humans more about the plan of God to save people from sin. The Lord sees that humans are in deep need of being saved. The Lord will not leave humans alone with no help. He promises to save them. This week we will look at the wonderful saving promises in the special agreement that God makes with Abram.
