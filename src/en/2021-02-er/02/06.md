**‘Look, the time is coming’ says the Lord, ‘when I will make a new agreement . . . with the people of Israel. . . . ‘I will put my teachings in their minds. And I will write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people’ (Jeremiah 31:31–33, ICB).**

The first time that we read about the “new agreement” in the Old Testament is in Jeremiah 31:31–33. Jeremiah talks about the time in the future when the people of God will come back to their own land after living in Babylon for many years. Then Jeremiah talks about the blessings that God will give His people at that time. God leads the way in the new agreement with His people, just as He did with His earlier agreements. God will keep His promises too.

Look at the words that Jeremiah uses: God is a husband to His people. God wants to write His law on their hearts. Do you see that God uses the same words that He uses in His agreement with Abraham? God says that He will be the God of His people, and Israel will be His people. These words help us to see that this agreement is not just a legal contract on a piece of paper. It is something far more wonderful.

`Read Jeremiah 31:33. Compare it with Exodus 6:7, which talks about the agreement God made with Israel. What does Jeremiah 31:33 show that God wants with His people?`

`Read Jeremiah 31:34. Compare what is being said in this verse to John 17:3. What does the Lord do in Jeremiah 31:34 to make a connection with His people possible?`

In Jeremiah 31:31–34, we see the ideas of mercy and obedience. We saw these ideas in the earlier agreements too. God will forgive the sins of His people. God wants a special friendship with them. God will show His people mercy. The people obey God because of these gifts. The people do not obey God as if they are robots that cannot think or feel. They obey God because they know Him, love Him, and want to serve Him. This idea helps us understand the special heart connection God wants with His people.

`God wants to write His law on our hearts. What does that mean to you?`
