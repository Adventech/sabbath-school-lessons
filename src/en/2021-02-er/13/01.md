### Read for This Week’s Study

> <p>Memory Text</p>
> “ ‘A thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I have come so they may have life. I want them to have it in the fullest possible way’ ” (John 10:10, NIrV).

THIS QUARTER, we studied the agreement. The agreement shows us the plan of God to save us.

The biggest promise of the agreement is everlasting life on an earth made new. But we do not need to wait for the new earth to enjoy the blessings of the agreement today. The Lord cares about our lives now. He wants the best for us now. The agreement is not some deal where you do this and that and then, a long time later, you get your reward. First, we must enter into a friendship with God by faith. Then the rewards and gifts of the agreement are blessings that we may enjoy here and now.

Our lesson this week looks at some of these blessings and promises. These gifts come from the loving favor of God. God knocked on the door of our hearts. We opened the door. Now he gives us His promises and blessings. Of course, God has more blessings to give us than we can study in our lesson this week. What we learn here is only the beginning of something that will continue forever.
