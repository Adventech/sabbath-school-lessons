### Read for This Week’s Study
Psalm 100:3; Acts 17:26; Genesis 2:7, 18–25; Genesis 1:28, 29; Genesis 3:15.

> <p>Memory Text</p>
> “Then God said, ‘Now let’s make humans who will be like [very much the same as] us.’ . . . So God created [made] humans in his own image [a copy of God]. He created [made] them to be like [very much the same as] himself. He created [made] them male and female” (Genesis 1:26, 27, ERV).

THE BIBLE tells us the story about how human life started. This story is filled with hope, happiness, and a perfect earth. God makes the earth in six days. At the end of each day, God announces that everything He makes is good. For sure, this good work does not include storms, earthquakes, food shortages, and sickness.

So, what went wrong?

After the 6th day, God says that everything He makes is very good. On that day God makes humans. These humans are a copy of God. God does not make anything else that looks the same as Himself. Only humans. The first humans are perfect in every way. Of course, they are! They are copies of God, right? These first humans are not killers, robbers, liars, or cheaters. So, if God did not make these evil people, why is the earth filled with them now?

This week, we will read the story in Genesis about how God makes the earth and the sky. Then we will study what happens to that perfect earth. Finally, we will look at what God is doing to make things right again.
