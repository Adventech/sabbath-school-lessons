### Read for This Week’s Study
Genesis 2:2, 3; Exodus 20:11; Exodus 16; Hebrews 4:1–4; Exodus 31:12–17.

> <p>Memory Text</p>
> “ ‘The Israelites must remember the Sabbath and make it a special day. They must continue to do this forever. It is an agreement between them and me that will continue forever’ ” (Exodus 31:16, ERV).

THE SEVENTH-DAY SABBATH helps us remember who we are as Seventh-day Adventists. The Sabbath also helps us remember everything God promises us we can be. We need the Sabbath. We are so busy during the week. We are busy spending money and making money. We go here. We go there. We go everywhere! Then the Sabbath comes and connects us again to all our beliefs. The Sabbath helps us to remember the things that are the most important to us as Seventh-day Adventists. God made the Sabbath. God made us too. The Sabbath helps us remember these important Bible truths.

The Sabbath never fails to come at the end of each week. The Sabbath fills every part of our lives. It helps us remember that every part of our lives belongs to God. God put us here on this earth. He is the One who made the earth and the skies in the beginning. This Bible truth is the reason for all our Christian beliefs. The Sabbath is the sign, or proof, that God made us.

This week we will study this sign, the Sabbath. We will learn about the important part the Sabbath has in the Sinai agreement.
