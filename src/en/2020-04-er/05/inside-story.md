### FINDING FREEDOM IN RWANDA

I am not sure why I agree to preach at the Total Member Involvement meetings in Rwanda in May 2016. I am the oldest volunteer. All the other volunteers are young people. The person in charge of the meetings is Duane McKey. He invites our Seventh-day Adventist Church in Paris to be a part of the meetings. As I said, I am not sure why I volunteer. I feel weak from being sick for a long time. My 23-year-old son killed himself a short time ago. But I sign up to go to Rwanda. They ask me to be in charge of the young people, not to preach.

Things change when we get to Nyanza, Rwanda. We meet with the local pastors. Then they ask me to preach. I run to my room and fall on my knees. “Lord, I have never preached,” I pray. “But You say that we do not do things in our own power or strength. It is Your Spirit who helps us to serve You. So, use me to preach. Please use me to say what You want to say. Let the people hear You, not me.”

The first evening, I preach about the power of the Good News. I tell how the Good News can change lives. I know that the people of Rwanda suffered many awful things in the 1990s when many Rwandans were killed. I suffered many of the same experiences that the Rwandans suffered. I talk to the people from my heart. Every time I ask people to accept Jesus, people are touched. Many of these people are women who had been forced to have sex. A lot of people decide to accept Jesus.

The more I preach, the more Jesus heals me. Yes, I gave my heart to Jesus many years earlier. But now I start to understand that I blamed God for what happened when I was a child.

My stepfather used to force me to have sex with him. I did not tell my mother until I was 12. She took me to a doctor and then sent me to live with a cousin. Shortly after that, she came to visit me on a Friday. I never saw her again. My stepfather killed her.

My stepfather spent only two years in prison because he was an important military leader. I lived in a home for orphans from age 13 to 19. My real father was alive. But he did not want to be my father. I felt so lonely.

I read the Bible. It started to heal me. I read these verses: Zephaniah 3:17; Zechariah 2:8; and Jeremiah 31:3. But I did not love myself. People told me I was pretty. But I did not feel pretty inside.

In Rwanda, the bad feelings inside me disappear as I preach. Jesus makes me free. I fully accept Jesus’ love for me. At the end of the meetings, 390 people are baptized.

Today, I am 66. I have gone back to Rwanda many times. My Rwandan friends are my family. They call me “Mama.” I work hard so that people everywhere will be made free by Jesus’ love.
