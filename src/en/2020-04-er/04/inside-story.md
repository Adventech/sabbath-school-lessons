### A VOLUNTEER BIBLE WORKER’S DARKEST NIGHT

One dark night God shows me His wonderful light.

Heavy rain wakes me up at 12:45 a.m. There is no light in the one-bedroom house I share with another volunteer Bible worker in Eastern Samar. We serve God there for almost a year. We have only two weeks left before our year is over. At that time, a big earthquake hits Samar and cuts off the electricity.

I cannot see anything in the dark room. But I hear strange noises. I grab a flashlight and turn it on. I shine the light at the door. I cannot see anyone. But I feel that someone has entered into the house. I shake with fear as I kneel under the mosquito net that covers our beds. I pray for my friend and me. “Lord, please save us as You saved Daniel and Joseph. We are here because of You.”

I lie back on my bed and say Psalm 23:1, ERV: “The Lord is my shepherd. I will always have everything I need.” I pick up the flashlight again. What I see in the beam of light is awful: a man with red eyes and wet hair. He holds a large knife. He is kneeling inside our mosquito net.

I scream as loud as I can. My friend wakes up. We both shout for help. The man jumps at us with his knife. We try to kick him away. Something hard hits me. I fall to the floor. Pain fills my body. Lord, am I going to die? I think.

I hear someone outside trying to open the door to the house. I cry, “Open the window!” When my friend and I hear the window open, we run to it and jump out. A neighbor sees my beaten face. She asks what happened. When she hears about the attacker, she rushes home to her children to protect them.

My friend and I walk barefoot in wet, empty streets. We cry for help. Everyone is asleep. Finally, someone comes and takes us to the hospital at 3:00 a.m. My friend has some cuts on her hand and foot. Her cuts are not as deep as mine. I have a deep cut from my left eye to my mouth. A doctor sews up the cut and gives me many shots.

The happiest time in that dark night comes when the morning sun rises. I feel as if the sun shines just for me. I smile as I feel Jesus’ deep love. Jesus is with me from the start. He will be with me until the end the same as a Shepherd watching His sheep. The police catch the attacker that morning. They put him in prison. I do not lose courage. Eight months later, I start to serve God again with the 1000 Missionary Movement. This time, I serve God in South Korea. I am now in my third year of serving God. I thank Him for the experience. The Lord says, “ ‘Pray to me, and I will answer you. I will tell you important secrets. You have never heard these’ ” (Jeremiah 33:3, ERV). My life is not mine; it is God’s.
