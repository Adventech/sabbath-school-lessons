POLISH POET Czeslaw Milosz wrote a poem about make-believe animals: talking rabbits, talking squirrels, and so on. Then Milosz compared these fake animals with our ideas about life. Milosz said that “these animals are fake, not real. In the same way, our ideas about life are fake too.” Then Milosz wrote, “This idea should make us very afraid when we think about it.”—Adapted.

Many ideas that humans believe about life are wrong. Here is an example: for almost 2,000 years many smart and educated people had wrong ideas about the earth. They thought that the earth did not move in outer space. People also thought that the earth was at the center of all the stars and planets in outer space. We now know that this idea is silly. But are humans really different today? Today, many smart and educated people believe that human life started from one tiny cell.

As humans, we look at life in different ways and believe different ideas about it. Our ideas and experiences change our understanding of life. Our understanding of life also is known as our worldview. We must teach our young people and our older church members about the Bible’s teaching or worldview. This week, we will look at what the Bible teaches us about God’s view of life.

We must teach our young people and our older people about the Bible’s teaching or worldview.
