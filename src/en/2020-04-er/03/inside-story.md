### TAUGHT BY GOD IN BRAZIL

One Saturday afternoon, my aunt gives me a small book filled with Bible verses.

“Just read the book, and God will talk to you in each verse,” my aunt says.

I have not thought about God in more than 20 years. I grew up in a Christian home in Brazil. But I stopped going to church when I was 16. I just finished traveling for a month in Brazil. Now I am ready to go to France to study. I will leave for Paris tomorrow.

I open the small book and see Proverbs 22:19 (ERV): “I will teach you these things now. I want you to trust the Lord.” The words touch my heart because I am a student. I want to know the things that God can teach me.

That evening, I join friends for a goodbye meal. But I keep thinking about Proverbs 22:19. I leave my friends and go to a church.

When I go in the church, I am surprised by the clothes that the young women wear. Every young woman wears the same things as me: jeans, high heels, earrings, and makeup. The music has changed too. The pastor does not ask if anyone wants to give his or her life to Jesus. I leave, feeling disappointed.

The next day, I fly to France. On the plane, I pray: “Lord, no one asked me in that church if I wanted to give my heart to You. Help me find a church in France that I can go to every week.”

I start studying the Bible at home. I watch sermons. I find a well-known Adventist preacher on YouTube. He preaches powerful sermons about Revelation. I watch 25 of his sermons.

One night, I wake up about 3:00 a.m. I decide to pray until the sun comes up. I do the same thing the next night and the next night too. For three nights I pray. As I do, I feel that Jesus’ coming is near. I confess my sins and praise God for His love. On the third day, peace fills my heart. I know God lives.

As I said, I watch many sermons by the Adventist preacher on Revelation. I wonder what church he belongs to. At first, I do not know that the preacher is Adventist. I find the preacher’s personal story about Jesus on YouTube. I learn he is Adventist. Right away, I look for the address of an Adventist church in Paris. On my first Sabbath at the church, I am surprised to see people studying the Bible in Sabbath School. The women wear clothes that do not show off their bodies. The sermon is about Revelation. God knows just what I need. I cry during the sermon because I am so happy to find this church!

God promised in Brazil to teach me. I have been learning from Him in France ever since.
