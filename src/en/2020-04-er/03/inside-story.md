### TAUGHT BY GOD IN BRAZIL

One Saturday afternoon, my aunt gives me a small book filled with Bible verses.

“Just read the book, and God will talk to you in each verse,” my aunt says.

I have not thought about God in more than 20 years. I grew up in a Christian home in Brazil. But I stopped going to church when I was 16. I just finished traveling for a month in Brazil. Now I am ready to go to France to study. I will leave for Paris tomorrow.

I open the small book and see Proverbs 22:19 (ERV): “I will teach you these things now. I want you to trust the Lord.” The words touch my heart because I am a student. I want to know the things that God can teach me.

That evening, I join friends for a goodbye meal. But I keep thinking about Proverbs 22:19. I leave my friends and go to a church.

When I go in the church, I am surprised by the clothes that the young women wear. Every young woman wears the same things as me: jeans, high heels, earrings, and makeup. The music has changed too. The pastor does not ask if anyone wants to give his or her life to Jesus. I leave, feeling disappointed.

The next day, I fly to France. On the plane, I pray: “Lord, no one asked me in that church if I wanted to give my heart to You. Help me find a church in France that I can go to every week.”

I start studying the Bible at home. I watch sermons. I find a well-known Adventist preacher on YouTube. He preaches powerful sermons about Revelation. I watch 25 of his sermons.

One night, I wake up about 3:00 a.m. I decide to pray until the sun comes up. I do the same thing the next night and the next night too. For three nights I pray. As I do, I feel that Jesus’ coming is near. I confess my sins and praise God for His love. On the third day, peace fills my heart. I know God lives.

As I said, I watch many sermons by the Adventist preacher on Revelation. I wonder what church he belongs to. At first, I do not know that the preacher is Adventist. I find the preacher’s personal story about Jesus on YouTube. I learn he is Adventist. Right away, I look for the address of an Adventist church in Paris. On my first Sabbath at the church, I am surprised to see people studying the Bible in Sabbath School. The women wear clothes that do not show off their bodies. The sermon is about Revelation. God knows just what I need. I cry during the sermon because I am so happy to find this church!

God promised in Brazil to teach me. I have been learning from Him in France ever since.

//1 God’s View About Life

**READ FOR THIS WEEK'S LESSON**:

Psalm 53:1; Revelation 14:6, 7; Ephesians 6:12; John 1:1–14; Deuteronomy 6:5.

> <p>Memory Verse</p>
> “The Lord’s eyes see everything that happens. He watches both evil and good people” (Proverbs 15:3, ICB).

POLISH POET Czeslaw Milosz wrote a poem about make-believe animals: talking rabbits, talking squirrels, and so on. Then Milosz compared these fake animals with our ideas about life. Milosz said that “these animals are fake, not real. In the same way, our ideas about life are fake too.” Then Milosz wrote, “This idea should make us very afraid when we think about it.”—Adapted.

Many ideas that humans believe about life are wrong. Here is an example: for almost 2,000 years many smart and educated people had wrong ideas about the earth. They thought that the earth did not move in outer space. People also thought that the earth was at the center of all the stars and planets in outer space. We now know that this idea is silly. But are humans really different today? Today, many smart and educated people believe that human life started from one tiny cell.

As humans, we look at life in different ways and believe different ideas about it. Our ideas and experiences change our understanding of life. Our understanding of life also is known as our worldview. We must teach our young people and our older church members about the Bible’s teaching or worldview. This week, we will look at what the Bible teaches us about God’s view of life.

We must teach our young people and our older people about the Bible’s teaching or worldview.
