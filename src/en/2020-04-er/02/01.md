AS HUMANS, we always learn. Life is a school.

“Education always was important to the Jewish people. The Lord commanded parents to start teaching their children about the Lord from the time they were babies. Jewish parents taught their children that God was good and powerful. The law and their history also showed that God was good and powerful. God told parents to teach their children songs, prayers, and lessons from the Bible. The parents made these things simple enough for their children to understand. Fathers and mothers also taught their children that God’s law shows the love in God’s heart. As the children obeyed the law, their minds and hearts changed. The law helped them to become as loving and good as Jesus. Most of the time, parents taught their children without using any books. But children also learned to read the Hebrew writings and study the Old Testament.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, page 69, adapted.

`For most of human history, parents educated their children at home. What does the Bible say about education in the family? What important rules can we learn about education from the Bible?`
