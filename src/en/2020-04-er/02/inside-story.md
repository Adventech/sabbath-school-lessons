### AN AUSTRALIAN MAN TAKES A BIG RISK IN AFRICA

Ettienne McClintock, 51, is not taking any risks in Ethiopia.

Ettienne is part of 2019 TMI (Total Member Involvement) meetings supported by the East-Central Africa Division. The first two nights, the electricity turns on and off. Ettienne spends the first two nights preaching in the dark. More than 400 people come to the outdoor meetings. The crowd is too big for the church. So, Ettienne preaches outside in a small shelter that someone builds. The roof is made from plastic sheets.

Ettienne worries as he gets ready for the third meeting. Sure, there is enough power. But it starts raining 30 minutes before the meeting. Ettienne worries that people will not come because of the rain.

The rain stops when the meeting starts. But then, the sky fills with more rain clouds. Ettienne preaches for about 15 minutes. Then the rain starts again. It comes down hard. People start to leave. The little shelter protects Ettienne from most of the rain. But the people who came to hear him stand in the open air. “The church elders and I pray for the rain to stay away. But then the rain comes back,” Ettienne says. “We have to do something. But what?”

All of the sudden, Ettienne knows what to do. Each night he preaches about God’s power over sickness, sin, and death. God also has power over the weather. Ettienne can pray for the rain to stop. But what if God chooses not to stop the rain? Then who will believe Ettienne’s message about God’s power? The people may stop coming after that.

1 John 5:14 comes into Ettienne’s mind. “We are sure that if we ask anything that He wants us to have, He will hear us” (1 John 5:14, NLV).

Ettienne prays silently. “Lord, I believe. But please help me not to doubt You.”

Then Ettienne talks to the interpreter. The interpreter is the person who explains his message in the Ethiopian people’s language. Ettienne asks the interpreter to invite everyone at the meeting to pray with him for the rain to stop. Right after Ettienne says “Amen,” the rain stops. It does not rain again for the rest of the meeting. After the sermon, about 200 people come to the front to ask for prayer. “There are people kneeling everywhere,” Ettienne says. “We kneel in the dirt. We pray a prayer of thanksgiving to God and give our lives to Him. That night, God gives me a new experience. Up to that time in my life, I do not take any big risks for God. So, I do not get any big rewards. But praying for the rain to stop is a big risk. It makes me feel uneasy and afraid. But the reward is wonderful.”
