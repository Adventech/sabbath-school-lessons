WAS THERE A TIME when you felt bad about yourself? We all have. We have all done things that cause us pain when we think about them. We have also done things we do not want anyone to know about. Everyone has had this experience, right?

Think about some of the bad experiences that happened to people in the Bible. Maybe you first thought of the time when Adam and Eve ate the fruit from the forbidden tree. Or what about Jacob when he tricked his father into showing him more favor than he showed to Esau? Then Jacob ran away in fear from his brother’s anger. How did Jacob sleep at night? What about the woman who was “caught sleeping with a man who was not her husband” (John 8:4, NIrV)? David also had this experience. He slept with a woman who was someone else’s wife. He wrote Psalm 32 after it happened. He also talks about how bad his sin made him feel. David also talks about how good it feels to turn back to God after we sin.

All these stories show us that we are all the same: we are all sinners. That is why the Good News about Jesus is for everyone. Jesus’ death is for all humans too.

So, Christian education must show us the only way to solve our sin problem. This week, we will look to the only One who can solve this problem: Jesus, our Expert Teacher.

_Jesus is our Expert Teacher. He is the only One who can solve our sin problem._
