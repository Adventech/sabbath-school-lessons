### MIRACLE ON A ROAD IN INDIA

My husband and I build a small church in a village in India. So, we travel to the city to buy building materials. We also need to buy supplies for the student volunteers who help us share the Good News in this part of India.

My husband buys electrical equipment for the church we are building. I find 15 guitars for the volunteers and 100 notebooks for their classes. It is 9:00 p.m. when we start the three-hour trip back to the village.

About a half hour before we get home, we hear a strange noise. The noise is very loud. We are not sure what is happening. My husband stops the car and gets out to find out what is going on. A tire on our car is flat.

When we see the flat tire, we look at each other and laugh very hard for some time. “How many times have we had a flat tire that was this bad?” my husband asks.

“Many, many times,” I say with a smile. “No one can ever say our life as volunteers for Christ is boring!”

It is the middle of the night. We do not have a spare tire. We are stuck in the country with no one around to help us. We call Pastor Abishek for help. As we wait for the pastor, we sit in the car and listen to music. Because the AC does not work, we both start to sweat. I wave away a mosquito that flies into our car.

All of a sudden, lightning fills the dark sky. Thunder rumbles. Raindrops fall on the windows of our car. “Honey,” I say. “As I said, our life is not boring here in India.”

After a while, Pastor Abishek arrives to pick us up. We put the 15 guitars, 100 notebooks, and electrical equipment into his small truck.

As we drive, the pastor says something that surprises us.

“When you called me, my cell phone was turned off. I turn it off so I can sleep. I do not know how it happened, but I woke up at midnight and looked at my phone at the very instant that you called me. I usually do not wake up at all at night. I usually sleep the whole night.”

Our hearts shake as he tells us this. God wakes up Pastor Abishek from his deep sleep and tells him to check his phone. God knows that two of His children are stuck in the middle of the country and need help. They want to get home badly.

By now the rain comes down hard. Lightning lights up the road. Thunder booms. But we are happy. We are going home. Thank You, Lord! Thank you, Angel Abishek!
