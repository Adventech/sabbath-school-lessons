As we saw yesterday, Eve does not believe God’s words. Eve does not misunderstand God’s command. But she does not say God’s words in the same way God says them (Gen. 3:2, 3). Awful things happened because of Eve’s disobedience. Of course, God’s command about the trees is not new to the snake. The snake already knew about God’s command. He was ready to change God’s words and lead Eve into sin.

`Read Genesis 3:4–6. Do you see that the snake lies about what God said? What else does the snake say that Eve believes? How does the snake trick Eve into believing him and not God?`

The snake tells Eve that part of God’s message is wrong. Eve does not talk with God about it. That is Eve’s mistake. Eve has the chance to talk with God. God is her Mighty Teacher. In Eden she talks with God. At that time, Eve can look at God’s face and talk with Him. But Eve does not run away from the snake. She does not go to God and ask for His help. Eve accepts the snake’s message. She doubts God’s words to her.

Soon after, Adam must make a hard decision. “Adam understands that Eve has sinned against God’s command. Eve failed to obey the one thing that God asked them not to do. It was a test of their loyalty and their love. Adam fought a war in his mind. He was sorry that he allowed Eve to leave his side. But she made her choice. Now Adam must separate from Eve, who made him so happy. How can he live without her?”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, page 56, adapted. Sadly, Adam chose to do the wrong thing too. What made Adam’s behavior worse than Eve’s? Adam knew better.

`Think of the snake’s lying words. He says that if Adam and Eve eat the forbidden fruit they will “be like [very much the same as] God” (Genesis 3:5, NKJV). But look at Genesis 1:27. Can you see that Adam nd Eve were already very much the same as God? What does this comparison teach us about how we are easily tricked? Why are faith and obedience the only things that can keep us safe from the danger of atan’s lies?`

_Eve accepts the snake’s message. She doubts God’s words to her._
