### HELPING A RELIGIOUS LEADER IN NEED

A Romanian priest, or religious leader, comes to me with a problem. “Can you help me talk to university professors and let them know that I have a good job and a good education?” he asks. “I want to study here.”

The priest signed up to study about God at the University of Strasbourg in France. But the professors in charge decide that the priest first needed to study for another year before he got into the school. I have been in the school for two years. I am studying to get my PhD. The priest and I start our friendship when we learn that we both are from Romania.

I smile at the priest. “Do you believe in God?” I ask.

He is surprised. “Of course, I do!” he says.

“Do you believe in the power of prayer?” I ask.

“I believe that God can do miracles,” the priest says.

“God can answer our prayers if we pray to Him,” I say. “Before I talk to the professors, we should pray about this problem,” the priest agrees. Then we pray together.

I decide not to ask the professors to change the rules for the priest. I choose to show the professors that the education in Romania is as good as the education in France. I meet with each of the seven professors in charge of letting students into the school. Each professor promises to talk about the problem at their next meeting. Later, the professors decide to give the priest a test to see how much he already knows. After the test, the professors accept the priest into their school. The priest and I thank God for the miracle!

My friendship with the priest grows strong over the next two years. The priest often visits my home. He talks, eats, and worships with my family and me. But in his third year as a student, the priest announces that he is leaving the school. “I have a new job,” he says. “I have been chosen to be the Romanian government’s new leader for religious business.” The priest becomes the Romanian government’s top religion officer. This shows me that you cannot really know how much power your words and actions will have in another person’s life.

Some Adventists in Romania get scared when they learn that a priest is the new top religion officer. They fear that many smaller religions will lose some of their freedom to worship. But that never happens. The new top religion officer is very fair to people of every religion.

After the priest starts his new job, I ask to visit his office for a photo. “I want to show my kids that I know someone famous,” I laugh.

He laughs too. “Come anytime you want,” he says.

We continue to be friends today.
