  title: "Christian Education"
  description: "Yes, all true knowledge and education begin with loving the Lord. So, Christian education should turn our minds to God and what He teaches us about Himself. God has shown us Himself in the Bible and in nature. The Bible and nature show us everything we need to be saved in Jesus and to love Him with our heart and spirit. Nature has been hurt and spoiled by thousands of years of sin. But nature continues to show us the power and beauty of God and His love. The Bible teaches us how to understand correctly what we see in nature. The Bible is the perfect measure of truth. The best way to learn about God is in the Bible. The Bible shows us who God is, what He has done for us, and what He is doing for humans now. The Bible teaches us about how the earth was made and how we are saved. This message must be the center of all Christian education."
