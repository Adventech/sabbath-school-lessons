#### Perfect Health

_By Andrew McChesney_

Noy was a wealthy woman who oversaw more than 100 workers at a family-owned coffee plantation in Laos. But then she fell ill with a mystery disease in her village.

Her physician couldn’t identify the illness.

Noy went to many medical doctors across southern Laos, but no one could help.

Her health grew worse and worse until she could not even walk and was confined to her bed. More than that, she nearly lost her mind. Many times, she could not remember people in her own family.

All her workers left because she did not pay their salaries. Villagers told her and her husband that she would not survive.

At this low point in Noy’s life, a visitor arrived from Laos’s capital, Vientiane. The visitor, like Noy, was not a Christian, but her son and daughter-in-law were Seventh-day Adventists. She told Noy about Jesus.

“Maybe Jesus can save your life,” she said.

With assistance from her husband, Noy found the telephone number of an Adventist pastor in the south and called him for help.

The pastor traveled to Noy’s village and prayed with her.

Noy was encouraged by the prayer, and she decided to move temporarily to Vientiane. She wanted to meet Adventist church members and get to know them.

When she arrived, she could not get out of the bed, and she struggled to think clearly. Church members met and prayed with her regularly. Gradually, her health improved. She started to sit, stand, and walk.

Five months after falling ill, Noy returned to her home village in perfect health.

The villagers were surprised at what they saw. They had expected her to die, but she was alive and fully healed. Astonished, they asked her what had happened.

“Jesus saved me from death,” Noy said.

Now many villagers are interested in knowing more about Jesus, the powerful Physician who can heal all who ask Him.
