#### Sabbath or Scholarship?

_By Andrew McChesney_

It was an offer the Seventh-day Adventist girl could not refuse: a full scholarship to study at a private non-Christian school.

Malevelev grew up in an Adventist home and had been taught to remember God in all her decisions. She planned to enter Taiwan Adventist Academy when she finished sixth grade. Then recruiters from a private school showed up in her village and offered her a full scholarship.

Tuition was high at Taiwan Adventist Academy, and it would be difficult for her parents to afford it. They asked the girl to go to the private school.

During summer vacation, Malevelev visited the school and saw she would be required to attend classes on Sabbath. She wouldn’t be able to go to church to worship God. A conflict erupted within her: Should she accept the scholarship or keep the Sabbath? She knew she should choose the Sabbath.

At the end of the summer, Malevelev’s parents insisted she go to the private school. The girl felt dreadfully discouraged, and she prayed fervently.

“God, help me,” she prayed. “Show me what to do.”

Taking courage, she spoke kindly but firmly to her parents. “I want to go to Taiwan Adventist Academy,” she said. “I will not go to classes on Sabbath because I want to go to church.”

She explained her desire to remain faithful to God by keeping all ten commandments, including the fourth, “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy” (Exodus 20:8, NKJV).

“I don’t want to betray the truth taught by my grandfather,” she said.

Seeing the girl’s determination, her parents allowed her to study at the Adventist academy. Malevelev has studied for five years at the school and is in the 11th grade. “I have wonderful teachers and classmates, and we are like a big family,” she said. “I have made many Christian friends. We have morning and evening worship together, we pray together, and we study together. I cherish every moment at the school.”

Malevelev is hopeful for the future. “I know God will lead me and fulfill His wonderful plan for me,” she said. “When you need to make an important decision, believe in God and choose according to His will and pleasure. I encourage myself with [Ecclesiastes 12:1] all the time. Now I am sharing my secret with you, and may God bless you.”
