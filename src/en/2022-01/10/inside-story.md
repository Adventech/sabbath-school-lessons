#### God Is the Best Witness

_By Anna Likholet_

At the age of 18, I longed to share Jesus with others. But I was afraid.

Then I needed surgery, and I was hospitalized in Tula, a city about two and a half hours by car from Russia’s capital, Moscow. Three of the six beds in my room were occupied when I arrived. My operation was scheduled for the next day. What should I do? What does someone do before an operation? I thought. I opened my Bible.

The woman across from me immediately asked, “Are you a Christian?”

“Yes,” I said.

She then wanted to know which church I went to. I didn’t want to be mocked for being a Seventh-day Adventist. Many Russians belong to another Christian denomination and dismiss Adventists as members of a sect. “I’m a Protestant,” I said.

The woman wasn’t satisfied. “Which Protestant church do you belong to?” she said.

What could I say? “I’m a Seventh-day Adventist,” I said.

“Wow, a Seventh-day Adventist!” she exclaimed. “I know Adventists! They are the best people!”

The woman spoke enthusiastically about the church, its work, and Zaoksky Adventist University located outside Tula. The two other patients listened silently. They had never heard about the Adventist Church.

“Adventists are good Christians!” the woman said. “My father knows some nice Adventists.”

As she spoke, the physician entered the room. He was surprised to see her. “What are you doing here?” he asked.

“What do you mean?” she replied.

“I ordered you to be discharged yesterday,” he said. “You should already be at home.”

Her husband picked her up within 30 minutes.

God had answered my prayers in an unexpected way. He revealed Himself on His own in my hospital room. God had done everything. As a result, the other patients knew I was an Adventist and that Adventists love Jesus. If you long to share Him, He can arrange it. He will do everything for you.
