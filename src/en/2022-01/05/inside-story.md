#### Finding Peace

_By Andrew McChesney_

It was the worst day of Yean’s life.

The witch doctor approached him in their village in southern Laos and announced that he was going to die.

“And there is no one who can help you,” the witch doctor said solemnly.

Yean was scared. People in his village believed that the witch doctor always spoke the truth. He could not lie.

Yean did not want to die. He was so frightened that he could not eat or sleep.

Soon his wife noticed that something was terribly wrong.

“What happened?” she asked.

Yean told her about his encounter with the witch doctor.

“I am going to die,” he said.

He didn’t know what to do. His wife didn’t know what to do.

Then he heard about a small group of Christians who gathered on Saturdays to worship. He had never been inside a Christian church, but he decided to find out whether the Christians could ask their God to help him.

Next Sabbath, Yean and his wife showed up at the Seventh-day Adventist church. He told the church members about the witch doctor and his fear of dying.

After listening, the members told him about Jesus. They said Jesus had the power not only to save him from the witch doctor’s prediction of death but also to offer him eternal life. In their Bibles was the promise: “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life” (John 3:16, NKJV).

Yean was overjoyed when he heard about Jesus! He could claim the peace that only Jesus offers: “Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid” (John 14:27, NKJV).

When he left the church, he was so happy that he could not keep the good news to himself. He eagerly shared the peace that Jesus had given him with other villagers. He walked home with a big smile on his face. It was the best day of his life!

Today, Yean is alive and well, and he is attending the church where he first found Jesus.
