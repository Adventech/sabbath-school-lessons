#### Jesus, Miracle Doctor

_By Andrew McChesney_

Sengphet was a highly regarded medical doctor at the largest hospital in one of the provinces of Laos. But he was powerless to cure his son’s disease.

His adult son came down with the mysterious illness while working in Bangkok, Thailand. The young man was treated by Bangkok physicians but did not get better. So Dr. Sengphet (not his real name) brought his son back to Laos and treated him at his hospital. The young man’s condition, however, did not improve. Fellow physicians suggested seeking treatment at a big hospital in Laos’s capital, Vientiane. Dr. Sengphet brought his son to the Vientiane hospital, where he underwent multiple tests.

In the end, the physicians could find nothing wrong with his physical health. They concluded that the problem was psychological and that he had suffered a mental breakdown.

All the medical tests took more than a year. Dr. Sengphet and his wife spent all their money on their son, but to no avail. If they had known the Bible, they would have been able to relate to the story of the woman with the flow of blood, who “had suffered many things from many physicians. She had spent all that she had and was no better, but rather grew worse” (Mark 5:26, NKJV).

They brought their son home and, in a desperation similar to the woman with the blood issue, finally turned to the heavenly Physician, Jesus. They prayed in their bedroom for Jesus to heal their son.

As they prayed, their son walked into the bedroom. “What happened?” he asked. “Why do I feel peace all of a sudden?”

Dr. Sengphet and his wife kept praying. Then the son had what he described as a vision. He saw an evil spirit leaving his body, saying, “I can no longer stay because Jesus has laid claim over your life. You belong to Jesus.”

That day, the son returned to normal, and Dr. Sengphet and his family started worshiping Jesus. For months, Dr. Sengphet made no secret about his love for Jesus, telling everyone who would listen, “Dr. Jesus Christ healed my son, and my family and I have accepted Him as our Savior.”

After some time, however, Dr. Sengphet stopped worshiping Jesus. He seemed to forget how Jesus had healed his son, and he returned to his former ways. Please pray for him and others who have been touched by Jesus but no longer worship Him. Please pray that they will return to Him again.

_This mission story illustrates some of the challenges that Seventh-day Adventists face in fulfilling the church’s “I Will Go” strategic plan, including Mission Objective Number 2, “To strengthen and diversify Adventist outreach . . . among unreached and under-reached people groups, and to non-Christian religions”; and Spiritual Growth Objective Number 5, “To disciple individuals and families into Spirit-filled lives.” Part of this quarter’s Thirteenth Sabbath Offering will go toward opening an elementary school in Laos, helping to fulfill Mission Objective Number 4, “To strengthen Seventh-day Adventist institutions in upholding freedom, wholistic health, and hope through Jesus, and restoring in people the image of God.” Learn more at IWillGo2020.org._
