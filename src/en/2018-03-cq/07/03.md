**Testimony**: Hosea 2:23

“The Spirit of God accompanied the words that were spoken, and hearts were touched. The apostle’s appeal to Old Testament prophecies, and his declaration that these had been fulfilled in the ministry of Jesus of Nazareth, carried conviction to many a soul longing for the advent of the promised Messiah.

And the speaker’s words of assurance that the ‘glad tidings’ of salvation were for Jew and Gentile alike, brought hope and joy to those who had not been numbered among the children of Abraham according to the flesh.”1

“Centuries before, the pen of inspiration had traced this ingathering of the Gentiles; but those prophetic utterances had been but dimly understood. Hosea had said: ‘Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not My people, there it shall be said unto them, Ye are the sons of the living God.’ And again: ‘I will sow her unto Me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which were not My people, Thou art My people; and they shall say, Thou art my God’ (Hosea 1:10; 2:23).”2

“The hearts of Paul and his associate workers were drawn out in behalf of those who were ‘without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world.’ Through the untiring ministrations of the apostles to the Gentiles, the ‘strangers and foreigners,’ who ‘sometimes were far off,’ learned that they had been ‘made nigh by the blood of Christ,’ and that through faith in His atoning sacrifice they might become ‘fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God.’ Ephesians 2:12, 13, 19.”3

`1. How will you live and work to minister to those among you who are “far off” and “without Christ”?`

`2. What must they see in you to cause them to desire to yield to Christ and be drawn nigh by His blood?`
