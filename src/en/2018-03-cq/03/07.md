**Exploration**: Acts 2:44, 45; 4:34, 35; 3:12–26; 4:1–18

**Conclude**

Fellowship and making disciples seem to be the big driving forces for the life of the early church. They gave all they could for the cause of Christ. More than two thousand years later, the goal is still the same: to let the world see Jesus—to let the people of a dying and doomed world know that their Savior is alive. And He desires to commune with them and is one day coming back to claim them as His own. As Adventists we believe that we are tasked with a special message to this generation. How can we reach people for Christ in a world inundated with so many things pulling them away from Jesus?
