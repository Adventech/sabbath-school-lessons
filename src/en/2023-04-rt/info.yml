  title: "Filled Out and Finished"
  description: "These lessons are about God’s kingdom of grace and being a recruited agent (steward, citizen) of that kingdom. There is a battle going on between God’s kingdom and the kingdom of evil. Being agents of God’s kingdom requires action. We can’t just listen to what Jesus asks of us—we are to do it (James 1:22) if we want to be effective agents of the kingdom on this earth."
