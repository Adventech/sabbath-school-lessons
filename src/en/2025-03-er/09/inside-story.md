### All Things Working Together

_by Andrew McChesney_

Carl Casey was a helicopter pilot and a science teacher in Fairbanks, Alaska. Many years before Carl became a Seventh-day Adventist, he stopped eating meats that weren’t clean. Carl studied what the Bible said about the topic. He also saw that science supported Bible truth about meats that weren’t clean. So, Carl stopped eating them. But Carl continued to eat clean meat. At the age of 51, Carl had a stroke.

The stroke almost destroyed Carl’s life. He couldn’t walk or work. Then Carl read Romans 8:28, which says: “We know that in everything God works for the good of those [people] who love him. These are the people God chose, because that was his plan” (ERV). Carl read that verse many times in the past. But now the verse had new meaning for him. Carl saw that the Bible didn’t say, “Only good things happen for those people who love God.” The verse said, “in everything God works for the good of those [people] who love him.”

Carl stopped feeling sad or angry that the stroke happened. He started to ask God to use his stroke to win people to Jesus in Alaska. Carl wanted to say as Joseph said to his brothers, “ ‘You decided to hurt me. But God caused a good thing to happen because of that. God brought me here to save the lives of many people. You can see how that has really happened!’ ” (Genesis 50:20, EASY).

Carl started to share Jesus in Alaska. Alaska is a hard place to share the Good News about Jesus. The winters are cold and long. The roads are limited. The territory is very big. Only about 3,000 Seventh-day Adventists live in Alaska. The number of people who live in Alaska is 733,000. Carl understood real fast that his wheelchair was a wonderful tool for witnessing. People noticed him right away. As soon as they did, Carl talked to them about his love for God. People were surprised. They asked Carl, “You’re in a wheelchair, and you care about God?”

Carl answered, “You betcha!” Then Carl talked about God’s amazing love. He shared Romans 3:23, which says everyone has sinned and no one is as good as God. He also shared John 3:16, which says that everyone who believes in Jesus has everlasting life. Carl encouraged people to read the Bible daily and grow close to God. When we have a personal relationship with God, we will want to follow Bible truth. Then we will understand the reasons for keeping the Sabbath and eating a healthful diet.

Carl says, “I’m blessed to be alive. Most people die after a stroke this big.” Ten years later, he can say that many lives have been changed. After his stroke, God used him to win people to Jesus. So, God really does work for the good of His people.
