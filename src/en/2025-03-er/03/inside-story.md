### Monkeys Or Church?

_by Andrew McChesney_

Monkeys tried to destroy the crops of a family farm in the country of Mozambique, in Africa. António Cuchata’s father gave his son strict orders. Guard the farm to keep the monkeys away. But António didn’t want to guard the farm on Sabbath. Not long ago, António gave his heart to the Lord. He was baptized. Now he wanted to spend Sabbath worshiping in a Seventh-day Adventist church.

What should António do? António prayed and went to church.

Vervet monkeys were a big problem for small farmers. The monkeys stole sweet potatoes, beans, peanuts, and other crops. Father was worried that the family wouldn’t have food or income if the monkeys ruined their crops. Also, Father didn’t like his son going to the Seventh-day Adventist church. António grew up in another faith. So, Father didn’t understand why the boy wanted to worship on the seventh-day Sabbath. Father often didn’t go to church on Sunday so that he could watch the farm. Father told António that he also should help on Saturdays. António didn’t plan to become a Seventh-day Adventist. But a Seventh-day Adventist cousin studied the Bible with him. António became convinced about Bible truth when he read: “ ‘Remember to keep the Sabbath as a holy day. You may work and get everything done during six days each week. But the seventh day is a day of rest to honor the Lord your God. On that day no one may do any work: not you, your son or daughter, or your men or women slaves. Neither your animals nor the foreigners living in your cities may work’ ” (Exodus 20:8–10, ICB). António loved Father. But António also loved the Lord and Bible truth. He didn’t know what to do. So, he knelt and prayed. “Dear God, please stop the monkeys from coming to our farm while I am at church.” Then António went to the Seventh-day Adventist church in Casa-Nova. The church was 15 miles away.

António wasn’t sure what to expect when he got home. He was so happy to learn that the monkeys stayed away all day! António prayed and went to church the next Sabbath. Again, the monkey didn’t come near the farm. Every Sabbath while António lived at home, the monkeys stayed away from the farm while he worshiped at church. Sad to say, Father refused to believe that God worked a miracle. But António was thankful to God. Today, years later, he continues to feel amazed at God’s care.

António says, “The monkeys also kept the Sabbath!”

Pray for our worldwide church’s work in Mozambique and other countries in Africa and India. This quarter’s 13th Sabbath Offering will support our church’s work to share the Good News about Jesus in these areas.
