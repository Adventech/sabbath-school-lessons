### Baatka’s Best Friend

_by Andrew McChesney_

Baatka felt so lonely. He often stood at the window of his home in Mongolia. Baatka looked out the window and hoped for a real friend. Baatka wanted someone who would be his friend forever. At 14 years old, Baatka was shy and afraid. He was the only son in his family. Father was always at work. Mother wasn’t well, so she couldn’t give Baatka much attention. She spent a month in the hospital every year. Baatka felt so alone. He wanted to die.

Then a cousin, Doogii, invited him to go to a Seventh-day Adventist church in Mongolia’s capital, Ulaanbaatar. Cousin Doogii said, “Come to church, Baatka. Something wonderful will happen there.”

Baatka went to church because he was lonely. He didn’t hear a word of the sermon. The microphone wasn’t working very well. Also, Baatka had problems hearing. But he liked the church members. They smiled and accepted him. They were friendly. Baatka also like the singing. The church made him feel good inside. He went back next Sabbath to feel good again. Church members talked about God as their best Friend.

A church member told Baatka, “God can be your best friend forever, too.”

Another member said, “With God as your Friend, you’ll never be alone.”

Baatka wondered if God was real. Baatka thought, “Can God really be my Friend if I can’t see Him?”

After that, Baatka went to church every Sabbath. The church became the only happy place in Baatka’s life. The church members became his family. Life started to have meaning for Baatka. He wanted to live.

Slowly, Baatka started to believe God was real. His ears didn’t hear God speak. But Baatka heard God’s voice in his heart. God became Baatka’s best friend. God changed his heart and his life. Today, Baatka Orgil is 31 and a new person in God. The boy who was quiet and shy is now a church pioneer. Baatka starts new churches in parts of Mongolia where there are no churches. Baatka says, “I want to help people who are the same as me. That’s why I became a Bible worker and church pioneer.”

Baatka is now married and has two children. He said he used to think that God chose only the most talented people to serve Him. “But now I know that He chooses only the right people.”

He said, “When I didn’t believe in myself, God believed in me. If God can believe in me, I want to believe in Him, too.”

Thank you for praying for our church pioneers worldwide.
