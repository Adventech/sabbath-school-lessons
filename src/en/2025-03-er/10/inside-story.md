### Knowing An All-god

_by Andrew McChesney_

Iqbal didn’t know anything about Jesus when he traveled more 600 miles to go to a Seventh-day Adventist school in southern Asia.  Iqbal grew up in a non-Christian family. His parents sent him at the age of 20 to join his sister at the school. Iqbal was studying there and doing well in his English classes.

Iqbal went to every morning and evening worship program at the school. Iqbal wanted to know Jesus with all his heart. He read the Bible to learn more about Him. Soon he read Jeremiah 1:5: “ ‘Before I made you in your mother’s womb [body], I knew you. Before you were born, I chose you for a special work. I chose you to be a prophet [special messenger] to the nations [people from different countries]’ ” (ERV). Iqbal thought, “I want to know Jesus because He knew me before He made me in my mother’s body.”

Weeks passed, then months. Iqbal continued to learn more about Jesus. Iqbal thought, “Could it be that Jesus brought me more then 600 miles from my home to learn English and about Jesus’ love?”

Iqbal started to know Jesus’ love in his own life. Then 2 1/2 years after arriving at the school, he decided to give his heart to Jesus. Iqbal got baptized.

After Iqbal finished school, he went to college. Iqbal studied computer science at Lowry Adventist College in Bengaluru, India. He got a job on campus after he finished college. Jesus is his whole life.

Iqbal says, “Now, I’m happy to live with Jesus. Day by day, Jesus leads me. He takes care of me. Whenever I have a problem, I go to Jesus. He helps me solve all of my problems.”

Iqbal is amazed that Jesus knows everything. Jesus knew him before he was in his mother’s belly. Jesus also knows everything that Iqbal needs before Iqbal knows what those things are!

Iqbal says, “I thank Jesus for taking care of my needs long before I know about them. Before I ask, He knows what to give and the best way to give it to me. That’s why I trust in Jesus and love Him more each day.”

Lowry Adventist College got part of a 13th Sabbath Offering in 2024 to open an English language church. Thank you for your offerings this quarter that support important programs in our worldwide church.
