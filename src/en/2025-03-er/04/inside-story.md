### Jesus Sees Our Tears

_by Andrew McChesney_

No Christians lived in Kokila’s town. So, the townspeople got angry when Kokila’s father and four other families decided to keep the seventh-day Sabbath. Kokila was 9. Her father’s decision changed her life forever.

Kokila’s mother died when Kokila was a baby. Kokila lived with her father, four older sisters, and an older brother in southern Asia.

Father was a farmer. He was very poor. The town leaders didn’t let Father work in the field after he started to keep the Sabbath. The town leaders also refused to let father and the other Sabbath-keepers buy food from the stores.

Also, the town leaders made a rule. Anyone who spoke to the Sabbath-keepers must pay a lot of money as punishment. No one wanted to pay the money. So, Kokila’s neighbors refused to talk to her and her family. Kokila had many friends. She lost them all. The neighbors tried to force Kokila’s family to give up their faith. The neighbors entered Kokila’s home. They took the furniture, clothes, and dishes outside. They dumped everything on the street. Then the neighbors beat her father and brother. But Kolika’s father refused to give up his faith. One neighbor was kind during that terrible time. The neighbor wasn’t a Christian. But he wasn’t a member of the same big worldwide religion as all of the townspeople either. This neighbor helped Kokila’s family to buy rice. He talked to Kokila. He was happy to pay the money for breaking the town rules. For seven years, Kokila lived in danger. Three of the families who accepted the Sabbath left the church. Only two of the five families stayed loyal to God. One of those families was Kokila’s family. Kokila didn’t complain. But she cried a lot. Father saw her tears. So, he decided to send Kokila to a Seventh-day Adventist school away from home. Kokila went to live there as a student. The school was the same as a heaven on earth for the girl.

Today, Kokila is 39. She works as a secretary at the school. The name of the school is E. D. Thomas Memorial Higher Secondary School, in Thanjavur, India. Kokila remembers her happy time there as a student. She said, “The teachers talked to me! The children talked to me! It was so nice to have friends again.”

Thank you for your 13th Sabbath offerings. Your offerings support Seventh-day Adventist schools worldwide. E. D. Thomas Memorial Higher Secondary School got part of a 13th Sabbath Offering in 2020.
