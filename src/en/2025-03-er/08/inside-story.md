### A Wish Comes True

_by Andrew McChesney_

Eniah Ngulube grew up in Zambia in a non-Adventist home that kept the seventh-day Sabbath. Eniah’s parents went to a church that also taught that sick people should refuse medicine. Sick people shouldn’t go to doctors. The sick should ask only for the church leaders to pray for them to get well. If a sick person died, church members accepted that as God’s plan. Eniah loved her parents and their faith. But as she grew up, she and her sister started going to church on Sundays. Five of Eniah’s sisters and brothers joined the Seventh-day Adventist Church. They kept worshiping on Saturdays. Their parents didn’t care where the children went to church.

As a teenager, Eniah also wanted to become a nurse. She wanted to care for the sick. She also wanted to study at Mwami Adventist School of Nursing in the town of Chipata. The school was about 20 miles away from her home. When Eniah finished high school, she told her brother, Kenson, about her wish. Kenson was a Seventh-day Adventist church leader. Kenson liked the idea of his sister studying in a Seventh-day Adventist school. So, Kenson called a church president to ask when his sister could sign up for classes. The church president called the nursing school. Classes were already filled with students. But a day or two later, the school found a place for Eniah. Eniah was so happy. She was surprised they let her in because she wasn’t a Seventh-day Adventist. Her wish came true!

A week after Eniah arrived at school, the school held religious meetings for a week. Eniah listened to the speaker talk about baptism in water. Eniah thought, “Let me get baptized in water, the same as Jesus. He is coming soon.” At the end of the week, Eniah was baptized in water and joined the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Eniah, and other students like her, have learned so much about Jesus at Mwami Adventist School of Nursing. Many non-Adventists students are coming to the school and accepting Jesus. The school shares the love of Jesus with new students every year. Pray for the Good News about Jesus to be announced in Zambia and in other African countries. Our 13th Sabbath Offering this quarter will go to many of these countries in Africa.
