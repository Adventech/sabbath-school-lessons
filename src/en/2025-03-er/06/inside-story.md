### Sharing God In A Hospital

_by Andrew McChesney_

Dmitry Bagal was a Russian Bible worker. Dmitry lived in Germany. Dmitry got sick and went to the hospital. While he was there, he saw different types of people. Many people in the hospital were not Christians. Some people there didn’t believe in Christianity or belonged to other religions. Many of these people had questions about God.

A patient who was sick went to the hospital for an operation. But six weeks later, his disease came back. The doctor didn’t think there was any hope for the man. So, he didn’t operate again. The man couldn’t think clearly. He hardly knew who his wife was. The woman wanted to stay with her husband in the hospital during his last days of life. Dmitry gave the woman a book about God and suffering. Then Dmitry prayed with the couple. The prayer moved the wife to tears.

Later that day, Dmitry gave the woman copies of The Great Controversy and The Desire of Ages. Dmitry told her that the book gave hope to him and many other people. She wanted the books, but not for free. She gave Dmitry 14 euros (that is $15.00 dollars in US money). That was how much money the woman had in her purse. Dmitry believes he will meet this woman again. If not on the earth, then on the new earth! Dmitry also met a young man in the hospital. None of the doctors knew what was wrong with him. The young man was from Iran. The young man dropped out of school in Britain and flew to Germany to be healed. The doctors couldn’t figure out was wrong with him. The young man couldn’t walk. So, Dmitry pushed him around the hospital yard in a wheelchair nearly every day. The young man wasn’t a Christian. But he let Dmitry pray to Jesus for him. As Dmitry prayed day after day, the young man started to get better. Before long, he could stand and walk with some help. Dmitry and the young man talked in German. But because the young man studied in Britain, Dmitry gave him an English language copy of The Great Controversy. Months later, Dmitry continued to pray for the young man. These words gave Dmitry hope to keep praying: “But remember, you don’t know how your efforts will change the lives of people for the better.”—Ellen G. White, Colporteur Ministry, page 114, adapted.

During two weeks in the hospital, Dmitry gave away 20 copies of The Great Controversy and other books. He also gave many people business cards with QR codes so that they could download the book. Dmitry also filled ten of the hospital’s public bookshelves with religious books.

Dmitry says, “I planted many ‘seeds’ in people’s hearts. I pray these seeds will grow. We work under God’s leadership. He is in control. We must trust Him to bless our efforts.”

So, Dmitry pushed him around the hospital yard in a wheelchair nearly every day.
