### Trading Sports For God

_by Andrew McChesney_

Silva Langa was a high school student in Mozambique. Silva’s favorite sport was soccer. Silva loved to play soccer so much. He played whenever he could. Soccer was his god. Silva was a good player. He wanted to play soccer for a living after he finished high school.

Then a friend surprised him when he said, “There are many good things about you, Silva. But you don’t have God.”

Silva was surprised. Then his friend, Hodes, invited him to church on Saturday. Silva never heard about a church that worshiped on Saturdays. Saturday wasn’t a good day for Silva to go to church. Most of Silva’s soccer games were on that day.

Hodes was a good friend. So, Silva decided to go to church with him on the next Saturday he was free. Silva was surprised again. Church members were loving. The hymns touched Silva’s heart. Silva studied the Bible. Then he gave his life to Jesus and got baptized. Many of Silva’s family members and friends didn’t understand why Silva stopped playing soccer on Saturdays.

One of his friends said, “Your faith is crazy.”

Someone else said, “Why would anyone go to church when he could go to a soccer game?”

Silva explained his faith as best as he could. Silva’s parents got worried when Silva didn’t take the tests to get into college. The tests were on the Sabbath. Silva’s parents wondered why he was willing to throw away his future for the Sabbath. Silva suffered at this time. But Peter and the other followers of Jesus gave him hope. Their example gave Silva courage to announce, “ ‘We must obey God, not men!’ ” (Acts 5:29, ICB).  Silva’s parents grew more upset when the school called. Silva’s teachers wanted to know why Silva wasn’t going to Friday night classes. Many family members asked local Seventh-day Adventist leaders to tell Silva to study on Friday nights. In answer, the leaders told Silva’s family that God would be with Silva and help him finish high school. Before long, Silva switched to a Seventh-day Adventist High School. He had no more problems with the Sabbath there. Then he finished high school. Today, Silva is a businessman. He isn’t sorry about giving up his “god” of soccer for the God of heaven. His example of faith caused two of his sisters and some other people to accept Jesus and get baptized. Silva says, “God blessed my life. I thank Him that today my family respects my beliefs.”
