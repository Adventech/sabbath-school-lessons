### Healing The Mind

_by Andrew McChesney_

Mitch was a member of a gang. Mitch got into a fight with some American Indians in the state of Washington, in the United States of America. Mitch injured his head very badly in the fight. The doctors said Mitch never would work again.

Then Mitch’s younger brother, Stephan, invited him to the All Nations Center Adventist Church in Wapato, Washington. Stephan worshiped God every Sabbath at the church with their mother and sister.

At first, Mitch didn’t really want to go. But he went anyway. Then he went again and again. Mitch started to read the Bible. The Bible gave Mitch hope that God could heal his mind. Mitch read Romans 12:2, which says: “Do not become like [the same as] the people who belong to this world. But let God completely change the way that you think, so that you live differently. Then you will understand what God wants you to do. You will know what is good. You will know what pleases God. You will know what is completely right” (EASY). Mitch also loved reading Philippians 4:8, which says, “Now my friends, I want to say this [advice] to you. Fill your minds with thoughts about good things. Think about things that are true, clean, right and lovely. Always think about things which people know are very good” (Philippians 4:8, EASY).

Church leader Jeff Weijohn encouraged Mitch. Jeff said, “The Bible promises to heal your mind if you study it.” In his own life, Mitch started to see God keep His Bible promises. The doctors were amazed. They told Mitch he never would work again. But they were surprised to see Mitch get a job and keep it.

After Bible studies, Mitch gave his heart to Jesus. Then Mitch joined the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Soon after that, Mitch became a Bible worker. He started to teach the Bible to other people. Mitch and his wife invited homeless young people to live in their home. Anyone was welcome. But they must follow Mitch’s rules. One rule was that everyone went to church on Sabbath. The lives of the houseguests started to change.

One person told Jeff on Sabbath, “You know what? When you told us to study the Bible, we didn’t want to listen to you. But now we want to study the Bible.”

Jeff said that Mitch’s life completely changed. Jeff added, “When Mitch accepted God into his life, people were amazed. Mitch used to be a stubborn person. His brain was injured in a fight. Now Mitch shares Bible truth with other people. Mitch touched the lives of so many young people. God works in us even when we are not perfect and made mistakes in the past.”
