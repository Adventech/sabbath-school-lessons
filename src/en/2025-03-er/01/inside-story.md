### No Rats For Lunch

_by Andrew McChesney_

Peter enjoyed digging for rats in a mountain village in southern Zambia. The boy and his family ate the rats with porridge made from corn. Peter and his family also enjoyed eating pigs. Pork was always on their dinner table at Christmas. Peter and his family enjoyed bubble fish, too.

So, Peter was surprised when he learned that his favorite meat was forbidden in the Bible.

Peter heard about foods that were not clean for the first time when he traveled 20 miles from home to visit his brother. Peter’s brother worked at a farm that some Seventh-day Adventist Bible workers owned. The Bible workers came from the United States. Peter stayed for Sabbath worship. The preacher talked about animals that were clean and not clean in Leviticus 11. Peter understood that he and his family were following a meal plan that didn’t match the Bible’s teaching.

After a while, the Bible workers started to hold meetings in Peter’s elementary school on Sabbath afternoons. Peter went to these meetings. He walked two miles to arrive to the school.

Peter’s parents weren’t happy that their son went to the meetings. They tried to stop him from going. They told Peter that he was baptized when he was a baby. Father ordered Peter to work on the family farm on Saturdays. Peter didn’t know anything about keeping the Sabbath. So, he did his farm chores as fast as he could in the morning. When he finished, he went to the meeting in the afternoon.  During Peter’s high school years, he made new friends from Seventh-day Adventist families. Peter studied the Bible with them. Then he gave his heart to Jesus and was baptized in water. Peter stopped eating rats, pork, and bubble fish.

After a while, Peter’s parents started to respect the seventh-day Sabbath. They understood why their son didn’t eat meat that wasn’t clean. Every Sabbath that Peter was at home, his parents encouraged him to be on time to Sabbath School.

Today, there’s a Seventh-day Adventist church in Peter’s town. Because of the Seventh-day Adventist message, many people in the town stopped eating meat that wasn’t clean.

Peter is thankful that he learned about the health message when he was a boy. Peter learned to honor God with his food. 1 Corinthians 10:31 says, “So if you eat, or if you drink, or if you do anything, do it for the glory of God” (1 Corinthians 10:31, ERV).

Peter says, “I thank Jesus for saving me. I thank Him for Bible truth about foods that aren’t clean.”  Today, Peter Siamikobo is a church leader and a teacher at a Seventh-day Adventist high school in Zambia.
