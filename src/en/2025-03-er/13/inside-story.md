### The Sabbath’s Wonderful Reward

_by Andrew McChesney_

Fernando Joaquim Ge joined a big company of builders in Mozambique. Fernando was a Seventh-day Adventist. So, the company agreed to let Fernando have his Saturdays off. But after three years, the company boss asked Fernando to go on a business trip on Saturday. Fernando told his boss, Alexander, to remember that he didn’t work on Saturdays.

But at 5 a.m., Saturday morning, Alexander came to Fernando’s house to drive him to Zimbabwe. When Fernando refused to go, Alexander told him not to come back to work until they had a face-to-face meeting. Fernando and Alexander met many days later. Alexander told Fernando to stay at home for seven days with no pay. Alexander also gave Fernando three choices: (1) quit, (2) work on Saturdays, or (3) give up two days’ pay for every Saturday that he missed work. Then Alexander told Fernando to give him his answer in writing after seven days.

Fernando wrote a ten-page letter about his decision. He wrote that he couldn’t quit because he needed the job. He also wrote that he couldn’t work on Saturdays because he must obey God. Fernando included many Bible verses about the Sabbath. Then he said that he was willing to accept a pay cut for every Saturday he missed work. He also was ready to make up Saturday work on Sundays. Alexander took the letter. Then he told Fernando to keep working while he talked about the letter with his team of managers.

A week later, Alexander called Fernando on a Sunday to come to his house. Fernando rode there on a public bus. Alexander told Fernando to drive a company car to a town 70 miles away to inspect a building. Fernando came back late that night. The public buses stopped running, so he slept at Alexander’s house. The next Sunday, Alexander asked Fernando to take his mother out in the company car. The next day, Alexander held a meeting. Alexander said, “Fernando accepted a pay cut because of his faith in God. But now we see that he is loyal to God. So, he doesn’t need to work on Saturdays.” Then Alexander gave Fernando the keys to a company car. Alexander said, “Use this car for all company business. You also may use it for your church business, too. And we will pay for the gas. We ask for only one thing. Please ask your pastor to pray for our company to be a success.”

From that day in 2003 until today, Fernando hasn’t had any Sabbath problems at work. The company car has been a blessing to the church, too. When people see the car, they remember that Fernando keeps the Sabbath. Fernando says, “When we are loyal to God, He rewards us.”
