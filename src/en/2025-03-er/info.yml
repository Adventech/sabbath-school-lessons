  title: "Exodus: Journey With God"
  description: "In the book of Exodus, we read about our loving Lord who saves His people at the promised time (Genesis 15:12–16). God made this promise to Abraham more than four hundred years before. The time when God helps His people escape from slavery in Egypt is named the Exodus. The Exodus from Egypt and then Israel’s crossing the Red Sea were wonderful miracles and acts. These acts were the most amazing things that happened in the history of ancient Israel until the Cross. The story about the Exodus is the Good News about Jesus in Old Testament times."
