### The Book of Exodus: Journey to the Promised Land

In the book of Exodus, we read about our loving Lord who saves His people at the promised time (Genesis 15:12–16). God made this promise to Abraham more than four hundred years before. The time when God helps His people escape from slavery in Egypt is named the Exodus. The Exodus from Egypt and then Israel’s crossing the Red Sea were wonderful miracles and acts. These acts were the most amazing things that happened in the history of ancient Israel until the Cross. The story about the Exodus is the Good News about Jesus in Old Testament times.

God again and again worked miracles to show how much He loved His people. God’s heart was full of forgiveness for His people, even when they sinned against Him. With His amazing power, the Lord led His people out of Egypt. Helping His people escape slavery from Egypt was a miracle. Nothing ever happened in human history the same as this miracle before. God helped His people escape slavery in Egypt. Escaping Egypt was the beginning of Israel’s journey with God, from Egypt to the Promised Land.

Moses is an important part of the book of Exodus. But this book is not really about Moses. The book of Exodus is about the God of love and truth. God loves freedom, forgiveness, and being fair. This same God went to the cross and died for us. When we study the book of Exodus, we get a special look at who our God really is.

And who is He really? He is a God who is loyal to His promises, even when His people fail Him. God always is for His people, even when they are against Him. Again and again, God showed His people, Israel, His mercy. He encouraged them, corrected them, and taught them. God wanted His people to worship and obey Him because they loved Him for who He was.

The God of Moses shows us a God who wants to communicate with us. God wanted to have a close family relationship with His special people. God led them to Sinai so that He could have this deep fellowship with them.

Paul teaches us that what happened to God’s people in the past is a lesson for us: “Those things happened to them as examples for us. They were written down to warn us. That’s because we are living at the time when God’s work is being completed” (1 Corinthians 10:11, NIrV). Israel’s past history should be a warning to us. So, we should read, study, and learn from their past mistakes.

Below is our plan this quarter for studying the book of Exodus for the next 13 weeks:

1. Slavery in Egypt, the birth of Moses, and his first 40 years of life (Exodus 1–2).
2. God tells Moses to lead His people out of Egypt (Exodus 3–4).
3. Life gets worse before things get better (Exodus 5–6).
4. The 1st nine punishments (Exodus 7–10).
5. The 10th punishment and the celebration of the Passover feast (Exodus 11–12).
6. Israel escapes slavery in Egypt and crosses the Red Sea (Exodus 13–15).
7. The journey to Sinai (Exodus 16–18).
8. God’s Promise and Ten Commandments (Exodus 19–20).
9. Other laws for everyday living (Exodus 21–23).
10. God makes His Promise with His people and gives Moses the building plans for the tabernacle or Holy Tent (Exodus 24–31).
11. Israel worships the gold cow, and Moses asks God to forgive them (Exodus 32).
12. God shows Moses who He really is, and Moses’ face shines after the experience (Exodus 33–34).
13. The tabernacle or Holy Tent is built and given to God (Exodus 35–40).

Each week, we will study important verses and happenings from the chapters above.

May our loving Lord bless us as we study this important book. The book of Exodus helps us remember how much God wants to lead His people from slavery to freedom, from death to life, and from the desert to the New Jerusalem (Hebrews 12:22).
