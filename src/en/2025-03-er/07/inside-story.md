### “do You Like To Read Books?”

_by Andrew McChesney_

Dmitry Bagal was a Russian Bible worker. He lived in Germany. After his operation, the doctors sent him to rest and heal in Lower Bavaria.

While Dmitry was there, he walked over to a group of people at a Greek restaurant. The people told Dmitry that the restaurant was closed. Dmitry asked them a question, “Do you like to read books?”

One man answered. The man was Italian. He said he enjoyed watching movies more than reading books. The man read only one book in his life, the Bible. Dmitry gave the man The Great Controversy. Dmitry explained that this book gave an interesting explanation for history. The book also talked about the worldwide war between good and evil. The man read the back cover. Then he said, “I really want this book!” He gave Dmitry some money for the book.

Another day, Dmitry saw a stranger on a bench. The man said that he didn’t like to read. But his wife did. Dmitry gave the man a copy of The Great Controversy for his wife. The man read the back cover and said that he wanted to read the book, too!

Dmitry continued his walk. He passed a car with a bumper sticker that said, “God does miracles in Germany.” Dmitry wanted to meet the car’s owner. So, he rang the doorbell of the house in front of the car. On the door, Dmitry saw a sign that said: “Honey from our own beehives.” When a woman opened the door, Dmitry asked her about the honey. Dmitry and the woman talked about honey for a few minutes. Then they talked about faith. The woman said that Jesus healed her of a disease. The healing was a miracle. Dmitry bought a jar of honey. Then he gave the woman the choice of a book as a gift: The Desire of Ages or The Great Controversy. The woman chose The Desire of Ages. Then she thanked Dmitry and gave him a second jar of honey as a gift. Dmitry thanked her with the other book, The Great Controversy. Both Dmitry and the lady were very happy with their meeting. During his month of rest and healing, Dmitry gave away almost 50 copies of The Great Controversy. He decided to change the type of work he does for God in Germany. “Because I enjoy sharing books so much, I’m going to be a Bible book worker in Germany.”
