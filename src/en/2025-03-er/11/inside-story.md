### Filled With God’s Love

_by Andrew McChesney_

16-year-old Domenico didn’t want to lose Fulvia after he met her in Florence, Italy. So, he lied when she asked about his parents.

Fulva asked Domenico, “What do your parents do?”

Domenico said, “My parents are rich. They own a beautiful car.”

Then Fulvia asked Domenico where he lived. Without thinking, he gave her the address of the orphanage where he lived. But when Fulvia went to the address, she found the orphanage. So, Domenico couldn’t lie anymore. He said, “I’m an orphan. I live here.”

Fulvia told her father everything. Domenico thought their relationship was over. But her father’s answer surprised Domenico.

Fulvia’s father said, “We have three children. Invite Domenico over. Then we’ll have four kids.”

Fulvia’s family accepted Domenico the same as a son. Domenico visited their home often. The family made Domenico feel very loved. Domenico learned about God’s love for the first time. Domenico heard about God before. But now he saw God’s love in real life. Domenico wanted to know God. He started to pray.

Years passed. Domenico left the orphanage. He married Fulvia when he was 22. Domenico continued to want to know God. Domenico watched the 1956 American movie The Ten Commandments while he was in the orphanage. He wondered if there was a church that kept all ten commandments. He wondered if anyone lived the way the Bible talks about. When Domenico was 30, he heard someone on the radio say, “Now we’re going to talk about Paul the Teacher and Preacher.” Domenico listened. He noticed the radio show host said things about the Bible that no other Christians said. Domenico started to listen to the radio station often. When a radio show host talked about Ellen G. White’s book Steps to Christ, he called the radio station to ask for a copy. Domenico also asked if the station would send someone to his house to answer his questions.

Emmanuel and his wife showed up at Domenico’s house with the book. Emmanuel opened the Bible to answer Domenico’s questions. Then Domenico asked him to tell him about the history of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Domenico wanted to know more about the history of Christianity. So, then he read The Great Controversy. After seven months of Bible studies, Domenico felt God’s love fill his heart. He got baptized. Now 68, Domenico Civardi says, “I’m grateful to Adventist radio because it changed my life.”
