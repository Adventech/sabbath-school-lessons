### Accepting the Bible: part 2

by Andrew McChesney

Eulalia Rashid lives on the Pacific Island named Saipan. Eulalia wanted to read the Bible all the way through. It took her three years. Because of what she read, Eulalia started to keep the Sabbath and to eat a diet of plant foods. Eulalia had been an alcoholic for 37 years. She told her family that she didn’t want to drink anymore because of Jesus.

Eulalia learned she had cancer before she read the Bible. Then Eulalia got a painful rash. Eulalia suffered a lot from both the rash and the cancer. But all Eulalia thought about was Jesus. She felt she didn’t really know Jesus even after she read the Bible. She prayed for help to know Jesus better.

After she prayed, Eulalia decided to call the Saipan Seventh-day Adventist Medical Center. When a worker from the center answered the phone, Eulalia said, “I’m sorry, but I’m not calling to see a doctor. I need to talk with someone from your church. I’ve read the whole Bible, but I want to know more.”

A short time later, a young pastor came to Eulalia’s door. Eulalia and the pastor liked each other right away. Eulalia felt as if she knew the pastor her whole life. They started to study the Bible together. Then Eulalia asked to get baptized.

Eulalia was baptized in the fall of 2019. About a month before she was baptized, Eulalia’s terrible pain went away. A doctor told Eulalia that he couldn’t heal her rash. So, Eulalia would suffer for many months. But now the pain was gone! Eulalia touched her stomach. She felt that something else was different. A short time later, her doctor told her she was cancer-free!

Today, Eulalia shares Jesus with her neighbors and family members. Eulalia has four children and 13 grandchildren. Eulalia prays for her family while she takes care of her beautiful, green garden. She calls it her prayer garden. She gives the food she grows to her neighbors. Eulalia also made one of the rooms in her house a place where Adventists and other people come to worship on Sabbath evenings.

Eulalia is 66 years old. She knows the psalm writer was correct when he said, “Your word is like a lamp that shows me the way. It is like a light that guides me” (Psalm 119:105, NIrV). She says, “I want to encourage other people to follow the Word. Jesus is the Word. He is the way to everlasting life.”

This story shows two parts of the Seventh-day Adventist Church’s “I Will Go” Plan: Church Growth Task Number 1 and Spiritual Growth Task Number 5. Church Growth Task Number 1 is: “The church will serve God and support His work worldwide. The church will make supporting God’s work its way of life.” Spiritual Growth Task Number 5 is: “We will help people and families live more Spirit-filled lives.”
