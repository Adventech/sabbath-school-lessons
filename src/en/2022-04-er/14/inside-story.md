### Juice Bar for Jesus

_by George Kwong_

Wailoloa Beach is a popular vacation spot in Nadi, Fiji. Visitors enjoy the food and hotels, which are not too expensive. Many people also come for the bars and other nightclubs. When COVID-19 started, many small cafés, fast-food restaurants, and other restaurants lost customers. One of these places was the Bamboo Hotel.

At this time, some Seventh-day Adventists decided to work with the owners of the Bamboo Hotel. Together, they opened a juice bar. The bar offered more than juice. It also offered health and exercise classes, weight-loss classes, and special meal plans to help people lose weight or feel better. The juice bar was named Bitu Health Bar. Bitu means “bamboo” in the local language. The Bitu Health Bar became popular right away with the local citizens. They came daily to drink the fresh juices.

Church members prayed that the juice bar would help encourage Fijians to lead more healthful lives. People in Fiji have many lifestyle diseases. The Seventh-day Adventist Church headquarters in the South Pacific supported the bar. Church leaders hoped that the bar would help Fijians to stop drinking alcohol and choose more healthful drinks.

But then COVID-19 hit Fiji a second time. The local city leaders ordered the Bamboo Hotel to shut down, along with the juice bar. For two weeks, customers called every day to find out when and where the juice bar was going to open again.

What happened next surprised everyone.

A married couple who managed the Beach Escape Hotel next door to the Bamboo Hotel watched crowds pour in and out of the Bamboo Hotel every day. The couple saw that more people visited the juice bar than the bar that served alcohol. The couple also was happy to see that there were less crimes caused by alcohol in their neighborhood.

The couple contacted church members and offered the use of their bar for their health classes. Church members said no at first. They didn’t want to offer fruit juice in the same place that sold alcohol. But the managers explained that they wanted to stop selling alcohol. The couple removed all the alcohol and bar equipment. Then they replaced it with juicing machines, blenders, fruits, vegetables, and herbs. The Bitu Health Bar was open again!

Church members are amazed at the wonderful way that God leads. The juice bar has helped many customers at the Bamboo Hotel. The juice bar also has changed the Beach Escape Hotel into a center for hope and healing in the community. Thank you for giving a big offering this quarter to support new church programs in the South Pacific and in other areas.
