### A brave witness for Jesus

_by Rick McEdward_

On the first day of class, a classmate asked Sandra for her permission to let him take a picture of her class notes with his cell phone. “I saw you are writing in English,” he said. “I want to improve my English skills.”

Classes at the university in the Middle East were not taught in English. But English was Sandra’s first language. So, it was easier for her to take notes in English. “Here you are,” Sandra said, holding out her notebook.

The next day, the classmate again asked for her permission to take pictures of her notes. After he asked to take pictures for several days, Sandra decided to start writing her favorite Bible verses at the bottom of the pages of her notebook. The next time the classmate asked to take a picture, Sandra felt worried. Would he stop asking to see her notes when he saw the Bible verses? Sandra prayed for God to use the Bible verses to bring honor and praise to His name.

At first, the classmate didn’t pay attention to the Bible verses. But after a couple of days, he saw that Sandra’s notes had information that the teacher hadn’t talked about during the class. The classmate went to Sandra and pointed to a verse at the bottom of a page. “Is this a verse from the Bible?” he asked.

“Yes,” Sandra said as she wondered how to explain it.

The classmate asked, “Is this how you help yourself study?”

Sandra smiled. “Exactly. I write my favorite verses in my notebook. They are really helpful and useful for my life.”

After that day, the classmate asked Sandra many questions about her religion and beliefs. Sandra taught him about the beliefs of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. When the class ended, the classmate asked to make a copy of Sandra’s whole notebook. He wanted to share the notebook with his family.

Sandra hasn’t had another class with her friend since that time. But they stay in touch. He often asks her for advice about life. Sandra prays for her friend. She thanks God for helping her to be brave enough to write the Bible verses at the bottom of her notebook pages.

This story shows two parts of the “I Will Go” Plan for the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Growth Task Number 1 is: “The church will serve God and support His work worldwide. The church will make supporting God’s work its way of life.” Church Growth Task Number 2 is: “The church will help the Adventist Church grow strong in new ways in large cities. We will share Jesus with people who do not know Him in North Africa, the Middle East, and Asia.” Read more at IWillGo2020.org.
