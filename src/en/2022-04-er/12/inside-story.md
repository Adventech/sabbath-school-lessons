### Jesus Beats the Dragon

_by Andrew McChesney_

Kue lives in northern Laos. Something strange happened to Kue late in 2020. Her body became swollen. Her belly swelled up the worst.

Kue’s husband, Cheng, took her to the local witch doctor. The witch doctor said that a dragon filled Kue with his baby. The dragon planned to carry Kue away to live with him under the water. The witch doctor said, “You need to kill animals and offer them to the dragon. Maybe then the dragon will let Kue’s spirit leave his underwater cave.”

Cheng gave the shaman everything he asked for. But Kue became more sick. Cheng asked for help from other healers in his village. They tried to heal Kue for the next two months. But nothing changed. Cheng spent all his money on witch doctors and village healers. But Kue’s health continued to get worse.

Finally, Cheng decided to ask a Christian pastor to pray for Kue. Two Seventh-day Adventist leaders were visiting Kue’s village. They prayed for Kue. Then they decided to send Kue to a hospital in Laos’s capital, Vientiane. At the hospital, a doctor said that Kue had a kidney disease. This disease caused her belly to swell with liquid. But after weeks in the hospital, Kue fell into a deep sleep and didn’t wake up. Another doctor put Kue on life support machines to keep her alive. The doctor said there was a 50% chance that Kue might die. The doctor asked Cheng who was going to pay for the medical bills to keep Kue under his care.

Cheng spoke with his family. They didn’t have any money. The Adventist leaders, who paid her first bills, didn’t have any more money. Cheng had no money. He didn’t have any hope that Kue would live. So, he made a difficult decision. He removed his wife from life support and brought her home. He expected her to die at home.

Later, a church leader said, “It was painful to send Kue back home to die. But we couldn’t do anything for her. We hoped that God would show mercy to Kue and do a miracle for her.”

Days later, Cheng invited the Adventist pastor to pray for Kue in their home. The pastor lived far away. He arrived with several Bible workers. The pastor decided to stay for a few days to help with Kue’s funeral. While the family waited for Kue to die, the pastor and the Bible workers prayed and went without food each day. Kue got better. She started to breathe easily on her own. The swelling went away. By May 2021, Kue was able to walk all by herself without anyone’s help.

Today, Kue is a living miracle to the people of northern Laos. She is proof that there is a God in heaven. Thank you for your Sabbath School offerings that help share the Good News in Laos and around the world.
