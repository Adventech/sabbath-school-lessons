### Every Penny Belongs to God

_by Andrew McChesney_

Shyamala’s eyes got big with surprise when she read the handwriting on the note. The note was sent in an envelope to Global Mission at the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. Global Mission workers start new churches in places where people don’t know about Jesus. Two checks worth $110.52 were inside the envelope.

The person who sent the note wrote, “I am sending this offering to Global Mission to help people learn about God’s love. I love God and try to help share the Good News about Jesus in my neighborhood.” The writer explained that the offering she sent to Global Mission came from pennies that she found on the street. When her jar of pennies got full, she took them to the bank. The bank gave her a check worth $110.52 for the pennies.

“This gift comes from pennies that I collected for Jesus,” the woman wrote. “I hope my gift will bring smiles to someone as you share the love of God.”

A week earlier, another surprising letter arrived at Global Mission’s office at the General Conference. The letter came from the West Coast of the United States. The letter had no note. But inside the letter, Shyamala found a check for $165.00. The check came from a prison that sent the check for one of their prisoners. Prisoners only earned up to $55.00 per month at the prison. So, the prisoner who sent the check had to work at least three months to earn enough money to send a check for $165.00. Shyamala was shocked because this prisoner sent more than one check.

Shyamala works with Nimfa. Together they manage the offerings that people send to Global Mission. Nimfa opened up a letter from a man who called Global Mission a few days earlier. The man wanted to know if Global Mission had gotten the money he sent them online. Nimfa learned that the man’s bank had refused to send the money. The man asked Nimfa about the best way to send the money to Global Mission. Nimfa told the man to send a check. A few days later, a check arrived in the mail for $70,000.00. The money came from the sale of a piece of land. Nimfa said, “The man who sold the land made God a promise. The man said that if God helped him sell the property, the man would give God all the money from the sale.”

Shyamala and Nimfa’s hearts are touched by these stories. The stories help these women remember that every penny belongs to God. Some people can afford to send only a dollar. One person has sent three one-dollar bills for many years. Big or small, every penny that Global Mission gets goes to help finish God’s work so Jesus can come.
