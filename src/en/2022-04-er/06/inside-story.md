### “Don’t Fight Back!”

_by Rick McEdward_

In this story, we will tell you about Omar. But Omar is not his real name. We named him Omar to protect him. Omar was a university student in the Middle East. Omar needed a job. But he refused to work on Sabbath. He told the manager at a company when he went to get a job that Saturdays were his holy day. The manager said, “We don’t need you.” That was correct. There were many people out of work in his country and very few jobs. So, the manager easily could find someone else willing to work on the Sabbath.

Omar was sad when he left the company’s office. Omar was a new Christian. He gave his life to Jesus a few days ago. Omar had studied the Bible with Christians for six years. Then he decided to accept Jesus as his Savior. After Omar did not get the job, he bought a food cart. Omar planned to make money by selling sesame-seed bread. Omar’s Sabbath-keeping friends were touched by his loyal stand for Jesus. They prayed for him.

A few days later, Omar announced that the company called him back and offered him the job with Saturdays off. Omar was so excited that he decided to find at least one new person to talk to about Jesus everyday.

Later that week, Omar sat at a local café. He and an older man started to talk about religion. Omar told the man about the peace he found when he gave his life to Jesus.

When Omar left the café, a man from a nearby table followed him. The man heard Omar’s conversation with the older gentleman. The man yelled at Omar. “I can’t believe that you can say these crazy things! Aren’t you ashamed? You grew up in our country and you know better!” The man started to beat Omar with his fists. Later that day, a Sabbath-keeping friend called Omar on a FaceTime phone call. The friend was surprised to see Omar’s puffy black eye. Omar smiled at his friend with joy.

“You could have called the police,” Omar’s friend said.

“Yes,” Omar said. “But I remembered that Jesus tells us ‘Do not fight back!’ ”

Jesus told His followers, “ ‘You have heard that it was said, “An eye must be put out for an eye. A tooth must be knocked out for a tooth” (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21). But here is what I tell you. Do not fight against an evil person. Suppose someone slaps you on your right cheek. Turn your other cheek to them also’ ” (Matthew 5:38, 39, NIrV).

Read the “I Will Go” Plan for the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Growth Task Number 2 for the church is: “The church will help the Adventist Church grow strong in new ways in large cities. We will share Jesus with people who do not know Him in North Africa, the Middle East, and Asia.”
