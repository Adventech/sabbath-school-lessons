### “Signs and Proofs”

_by Dmitry Bagal_

Several months ago, I was studying the book of Isaiah in the Adult Sabbath School Bible Study Guide. That’s when I read Isaiah 8:18. In this verse, Isaiah says, “I am here. And with me are the children the Lord has given me. We are signs and proofs for the people of Israel” (Isaiah 8:18, ICB). I felt that God was talking about me in this verse. My wife and I already had one child. We were waiting for our second child to be born. I read the verse from Isaiah again. I thought, “I want so much to be part of a miracle for God, too!”

I remembered reading about how God helped many Seventh-day Adventists collect lots of money for God’s work. These Adventists had no money, but they had a lot of faith. I prayed, “Lord, I also want to collect an offering for You. Soon my second child will be born. My baby is the reason I want to collect this money for You. Please show me how much money I should give You, with Your help. This offering will be my gift to You to show You that I am thankful for my healthy baby girl. Also, please let me know who should get the special offering.”

Almost right away, I felt that the Lord wanted me to collect an offering of 1,000 euros (about U.S.$1,185.00 American dollars). This was a lot of money for me to collect. I didn’t earn a lot of money at my job in Germany. But I prayed, “Lord, this is Your plan. So, You will make sure the money comes from somewhere. You know that I don’t earn a lot of money. I don’t make enough money to save extra. All I can promise is to pray daily and save any extra money that I make.”

Every day, I asked God to help me collect the 1,000 euros. In less than a month, I had collected about half the amount. An older couple gave me 200 euros after I helped them move into their new home. I did not expect them to pay me at all! Then an Adventist businessman gave me 200 euros when my wife and I let two of his workers stay in our home for the night. We didn’t expect any money. We just wanted to be kind! After that, a married couple put 50 euros in our bank account. They didn’t tell us they were going to do that! A month before our baby was born, I already had the 1,000 euros.

Our daughter Maranatha Yessenia was born on May 4. I parked in front of the hospital at 8:37 a.mm. Our baby was born 20 minutes later! I gave the offering I collected to the Lord. The Lord made it possible for me to collect the money. Today, my wife and I are blessed with our two children. Now, I can say with Isaiah, “I am here. And with me are the children the Lord has given me. We are signs and proofs for the people of Israel” (Isaiah 8:18, ICB). Thanks for supporting God’s work with your offerings each week in Sabbath School.
