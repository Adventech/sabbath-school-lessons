### Sharing Living Water

_by David Maldonado_

Antonio Maldonado was a guest at a dinner at the White House. He was with a group of miners from Peru. Antonio watched as a waiter served whiskey to the guests. The guests were about to lift their glasses and take a sip in honor of the president of the United States, Lyndon B. Johnson. Antonio wanted to honor the president, too. But first, he wanted to switch his whiskey for water. Antonio did not speak much English. So, he told someone who spoke English and Spanish what he wanted. Then that person, the interpreter, told the waiter.

Everyone at the special dinner held a glass of whiskey. Antonio didn’t want to embarrass anyone from his country sitting at the table. These leaders came to talk with the president about trading with Peru. Antonio didn’t want to ruin their trade talks with the United States! When Antonio was a young man, he made a special promise to God. Antonio promised never to drink after seeing how alcohol destroyed many families.

While Antonio whispered to the White House waiter, a man watched him. The man watched the waiter bring Antonio a glass of water. The man watched as Antonio accepted the glass.

Then the man said, “Waiter, stop! What did this man from Peru ask you to do?”

The waiter said, “This guest wanted me to change his glass of whiskey for a glass of water, Mr. President.”

Lyndon Johnson, the man who watched Antonio, held out his own glass of whiskey to the waiter. “Please bring me a glass of water, too,” he said.

After the toast, the president approached Antonio and asked quietly, “Why don’t you drink alcohol as the other guests do?”

With the interpreter’s help, Antonio happily answered. “When I was young, I promised myself I would never drink. Many years later I made that promise again to God,” he said.

The president shook Antonio’s hand. “Thank you for being an excellent example. I also am a man of faith. God bless you.” Antonio’s decision never to drink alcohol had led him to have a meeting that he never expected with one of the most powerful men on earth. Antonio was filled with joy that he had shared his faith at the White House.

Today, Antonio tries to share Jesus every day with people where he lives in Concepión, Peru, with his wife, Enma. Antonio is 99, and his wife is 90. Their lives show the important Bible rule: “So if you eat or drink or whatever you do, do everything to honor God” (1 Corinthians 10:31, NLV).
