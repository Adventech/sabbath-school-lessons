### A Messenger for Jesus

_by Benjie Leach_

My name is Benjie Leach. In the mid-1970s, I served as the pastor for Forest Lake Adventist High School in Orlando, Florida. One of my jobs was to get to know each student. That was a big task in a school with 450 students.

At the beginning of the school year, a student came up to me and said, “Have you met Paul?” I answered that I had not.

“You need to meet him,” the student said. “Just ask Paul where he’s from.”

So, I invited Paul to my office. Paul was a shy 16-year-old youth. “So Paul,” I said, “where are you from?”

“I’m from a little town in Georgia named Plains,” he answered.

My mouth dropped open in surprise. “What?” I said. “That’s where Jimmy Carter, the president of the United States, lives!”

“That’s right,” Paul said.

Then Paul told me an interesting story. Early that summer, he needed a job to help pay his school bill at Forest Lake High School. So, Paul got a job at the peanut warehouse, which was the biggest business in Plains. Paul was excited about his new job. He explained to his boss that he needed to worship God on Sabbath. His boss agreed. When Friday came, Paul said goodbye to his boss and promised to come back on Monday.

“No,” his boss said. “You come to work on Saturday.”

“I can’t work,” Paul said. “I’m a Seventh-day Adventist.”

“Come tomorrow, or you won’t have a job,” his boss said.

Paul thought for a bit. “Can I talk to the owner?”

“But that’s the United States president!” his boss said.

“Is he in town?” Paul asked.

“Yes, but I don’t think he’ll want to see you!”

Paul went to the Carter home. He waited for the president’s guards to give him permission to visit the president. Soon Paul sat down with Jimmy Carter. Paul explained his problem and told the president that he was a Sabbath keeper. The president listened carefully. Then he said, “I respect any young person who stands up for his beliefs. You may have your Sabbaths off.”

That’s the story about how a shy, quiet 16-year-old teenager became a messenger from Jesus to the U.S. president.

You and I also are Jesus’ messengers: “So we are messengers for Christ. God is using us to call people. So we are standing here for Christ and begging people, ‘Come back to God!’ ” (2 Corinthians 5:20, WE). Let’s be loyal messengers for Jesus.
