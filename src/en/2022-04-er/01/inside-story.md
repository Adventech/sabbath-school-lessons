### No More Chains

_by Andrew McChesney_

A Seventh-day Adventist pastor visited a small village in the country of Laos. The pastor arrived with a small team of church workers. Then, someone started screaming. The screams were coming from a house in the village. The pastor ran to the house to help. He was surprised to see a 16-year-old boy chained to the floor of his family home. “What happened to your son?” the pastor asked the parents of the boy. “Why is he locked in chains?”

The parents looked sad. “Our son Aer has been sick for many years,” his father said. “He is fine for several hours. But then he goes crazy several times a day,” his mother explained.

Aer’s parents spent all their money on doctors and medicine. Nothing worked. Aer’s problem grew worse. His parents locked Aer in chains all the time to stop him from hurting himself and other people. Aer was chained to the wood floor for six months.

The pastor told Aer and his parents about Jesus and His saving love. “If Jesus wants to, He can heal Aer,” the pastor said.

The pastor asked the parents for permission to pray for their son. Aer’s parents were so happy. They accepted prayers from the pastor. They hoped that God would heal their son.

A few days later, the pastor and his team visited Aer again and prayed for him. The pastor invited the family to worship in the Adventist church near them in another village.

The next Sabbath, the parents arrived at church with Aer. Aer’s hands were in chains. Each church member prayed for Aer. Then the pastor also asked the boy’s father to pray for him. Everyone in the church bowed his or her head while Aer’s father prayed to Jesus and asked Him to heal his son. After that day, Aer was healed. His behavior was not dangerous anymore. Neighbors were surprised. They asked Aer’s parents many questions.

“Is this the same Aer who was sick for many years and was locked in chains?” one person asked.

“Why is he OK now?” asked another person. “Who healed him?”

Aer’s parent explained that the Christian God healed their boy. After Jesus healed Aer, Aer’s parents accepted Jesus as their personal Savior. Many other families in the village accepted Jesus, too. Those families were part of a group of 122 people who got baptized at the church in April 2021.

“We praise God for doing so many miracles in this village. Many people gave their lives to Jesus,” said the Lao pastor who shared this story with Adventist Mission. Thank you for your Sabbath School offerings that support God’s work in Laos and in other places on the earth.
