  title: "Our Hope for the Future:"
  description: "God made humans to live forever in loving friendship with Him and everything He made. But this friendship was broken by sin. Sin is a mystery. No one really understands how it happened. Sin first started with Lucifer in the courts in heaven (Isaiah 14:12–15; Ezekiel 28:12–19; Revelation 12:7–12) and then later with Adam and Eve (Genesis 3:1–19; Romans 5:12). Sad to say, humans started to die, and so did all life on earth. Death is everywhere we look today: in the leaves that fall and the flowers that dry up in our vases. We see death when our innocent pets die in pain and when death takes away our family and friends. Life is full of suffering and tears."
