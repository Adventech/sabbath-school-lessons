### “Modesty! Modesty! Modesty!”

_by Ocrhain Matengu_

People came to the hospital in Katima Mulilo, Namibia, to see the sick little boy. Akurious was only 2 years old. He had been sick for months. People cried when they saw his pain.

“The hospital isn’t helping Akurious,” said a visitor to Akurious’s parents, Modesty and Rebecca. “You should talk to the witch doctor. God will understand.”

“Just do it,” said another visitor.

After the last visitor left, Modesty turned to his wife, Rebecca. “What should we do?” he said. “Maybe the people are right. Jesus will understand.”

Rebecca couldn’t stand to see her only child in so much pain. So, she agreed to see the witch doctor. The witch doctor said that witches put an evil spell on the boy, and he must take some special medicine. Modesty and Rebecca bought the witch doctor’s medicine. They gave some of the medicine to their son daily. But the medicine only made him worse. Modesty started to pray hard. “Lord Jesus, I know I’ve made a mistake,” he said. “I turned away from Your mercy. Talk to me, Lord. Help my child. You healed people with awful skin diseases. You made the blind see and the lame walk. Heal my child, too.”

Soon after that, Modesty had a dream. He heard Jesus call him by his name three times. “Modesty! Modesty! Modesty!” Jesus said. “Akurious is My child. Why have you given control of his life to evil spirits? You must not go to any witch doctors if you want your son to live.”

Modesty was surprised and afraid. He threw away the witch doctor’s medicine. Modesty remembered hearing a Seventh-day Adventist doctor give a health talk at a camp meeting. So, Modesty took his son to the doctor. The doctor said Akurious had two lung diseases and sent Akurious to a hospital. Modesty continued to pray. Rebecca joined him. They put their full trust in Jesus. Akurious (see picture) now is 22.

Akurious’s parents, Modesty and Rebecca Kakula, had four more children. When each child was born, they refused to ask the witch doctor’s blessing. They took their babies to the Seventh-day Adventist church, where they gave them to Jesus. Please pray for people who accept Jesus but have a hard time letting go of their old ways of life and beliefs. They believe Bible teachings, but when trouble comes, they go back to the old ways. Seventh-day Adventist church workers try to help these people understand that their old ways of life don’t work. Thank you for your offerings that help these workers share the Good News about Jesus in ways that help people let go of their old ways of life.
