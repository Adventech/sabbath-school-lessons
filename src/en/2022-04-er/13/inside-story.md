### Two Dreams in Angola

_by Andrew McChesney_

Every time he went to church, little William Frederico João Lumbo heard the preacher say the same words. The big preacher stood in front of the church in Angola. He raised a hand into the air and said, “If you are not living to serve God, then you are not living life!”

The preacher’s words got his attention. But William also loved the pleasure and entertainment that this life offers. William decided that he wanted to dance more than he wanted to go to church. At age 14, he started a dance group. His group danced at parties and school programs in Angola’s capital, Luanda.

William enjoyed dancing very much. But deep inside his heart, William knew something wasn’t right in his life. He remembered the words of the preacher, “If you are not living to serve God, then you are not living life!”

Soon, William lost all joy in dancing. He started to smoke and drink. He felt empty inside. He prayed, “I am not living to serve You God. I feel that my life is useless. Help me!”

Shortly after he prayed, a friend sent William a sermon. The sermon touched William’s heart. He fell to his knees and asked God for forgiveness. He decided to go to church. All churches were closed in Angola because of COVID-19. So, William went to an Adventist house church.

A big surprise waited for William at the house church. The leader of the house church was a man named Filipe. Filipe had two dreams about William over the past two nights. In the first dream, Filipe was standing next to a big tree. Filipe held a small branch in his hand. Somehow, he knew he needed to connect the branch to the tree. Then the branch could grow again. In the second dream, Filipe was standing next to a big river. A small river flowed next to the big river. Somehow, Filipe knew he needed to connect the small river to the big river.

Filipe told William, “You are the small branch that needs to be connected to the big tree. The big tree is Jesus, who is the Tree of Life. You are the small river, and big river is Jesus. You need to be connected to Jesus, who is the River of Life.”

William was surprised. “Jesus wants me to be connected to Him?” he asked.

While William worshiped at the house church, peace and joy filled the empty space in his heart. William decided to be connected only to Jesus. Today, William lives only to serve God.
