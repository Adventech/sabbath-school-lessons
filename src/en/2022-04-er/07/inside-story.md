### Accepting the Bible: Part 1

_by Andrew McChesney_

Eulalia Rashid drank all her beer on Christmas Eve. So, she went to the store to buy more. Eulalia lived in the Northern Mariana Islands, which are part of the United States of America. The Northern Mariana Islands are a group of 15 islands in the Pacific Ocean. Eulalia was lonely. She was alone during Christmas. She had been an alcoholic for 37 years. She wanted beer more than she wanted to see her four children and 13 grandchildren. Eulalia also was sick with cancer.

On the way to the store, Eulalia saw a small wooden box on the dark street. Eulalia picked up the box and shook it. Maybe some money was inside. Sure enough, Eulalia found a penny. She put the box in her pocket. A few minutes later, Eulalia stood inside the store. She pulled out the box. In the store light she saw words written on the top of the box: “Your word [the Bible] is like [the same as] a lamp that shows me the way. It [the Bible] is like a light that guides me” (Psalm 119:105, NIrV).

The next morning, on Christmas Day, Eulalia read the words on the box again and again. “What is this ‘word’?” she wondered. “What is this lamp that shows me where I should go?” Eulalia always believed in Jesus. She didn’t know Him as her Friend and Savior. Now Eulalia tried to say Psalm 119:105 in her own languages,Tomoro and Palau. Eulalia learned to speak Tomoro and Palau when she was a child before she learned English. She read Psalm 119:105 in several different Bibles. But she didn’t understand what the “word” in the verse meant. So, she decided to read the whole Bible. Maybe then she would learn what “word” meant.

Sometime later, Eulalia read John 1:1, which says: “The Word (Christ) was in the beginning. The Word was with God. The Word was God” (John 1:1, NLV). Eulalia continued reading. “The Word became a man and lived among us” (John 1:14, ERV). “Here is the answer!” Eulalia thought. “The Word is Jesus! Jesus is the Lamp that shows me the way I should live my life!”

By now, Eulalia loved reading the Bible. She also started to pray every day. Soon her life started to change. She read about the Sabbath in Exodus 20. So, Eulalia started to keep the Sabbath in her home. She read about the food laws in Leviticus 11. So, she changed the foods she ate. When Eulalia saw that God gave Adam and Eve a plant-food diet, Eulalia planted a garden. She grew sweet potatoes, spinach, string beans, eggplant, tomatoes, mangoes, lemons, and dragon fruit. Her family was surprised that she stopped drinking. She told them that she decided not to drink anymore, and Jesus removed from her the thirst for alcohol forever. Eulalia’s example was winning her family to Jesus. She was a witness for Him and didn’t know it!
