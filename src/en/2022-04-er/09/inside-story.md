### “Rule Number 1: God First!”

_by Ocrhain Matengu_

Modesty Kakula is a businessman in Namibia. He has a surprising way of sharing Jesus. He paints these words on all the rear windows of his three cars: “Rule Number 1: God First!”

Here’s the story behind these words. Modesty’s first boss offered to sell him a car for 50,000 Namibian dollars (that’s $4,000.00 in U.S. money). Modesty worked hard and paid off all but 5,000 Namibian dollars ($400.00 U.S. dollars) in four months. But Modesty’s boss changed the price just before Modesty paid off the amount he owed. Now his boss priced the car at 60,000 Namibian dollars. Modesty asked, “Why are you changing the price just now when I’m about to finish paying you for it?”

A few months later, Modesty paid his boss half of the money he owed. Now Modesty owed only 5,000 Namibian dollars. But Modesty’s boss changed the price again! This time, the boss raised the price to 70,000 Namibian dollars. Modesty tried to pay off the car again. To his surprise, his boss accused Modesty of not paying him anything at all. Then Modesty and his boss went to court. The judge decided in favor of Modesty. But the boss told the court, “Modesty will have to kill me first before I give him that car!” Modesty’s wife, Rebecca, asked to talk to the court. She was crying as she spoke. She said, “Let the boss keep the car. God will make a way for us.” The employer took the car and gave back to Modesty only 22,000 Namibian dollars. Then the boss fired Modesty from his job.

At home, Modesty, poured out his heart to God. He had no job and no income. As he prayed, the tears fell down his face. He knocked his Bible to the floor by accident. The Bible opened to the book of Romans. Modesty picked up the open Bible and read, “We know that in everything God works for the good of those [people] who love him. They are the people God called [chose], because that was his plan” (Romans 8:28, ICB).

“Wow!” Modesty said. Peace filled his heart.

The next day, Modesty got a phone call. A man he didn’t  know offered to sell him a car for 23,000 Namibian dollars.

Modesty hurried to the man’s house. Sure enough, the man had a car for sale. Modesty asked the man to lower the price to 22,500 Namibian dollars. The man agreed. Modesty borrowed money from his parents to help pay for the car. Right away, Modesty painted the words: “Rule Number 1: God First!” on the rear window. Today, Modesty is a church leader and a business owner with three cars. Each of his three cars have the words “Rule Number 1: God First!” on the back window. Wherever his cars go, people point at them and say, “God first!”
