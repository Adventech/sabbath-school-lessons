### One Angel, Four Times

_by Nelson Cinco Reis Chitaonga_

Few people can say they’ve seen an angel for sure. Oyele says he’s seen an angel four times.

Oyele left his family for three years to help build a 250-mile (400 kilometer) road between the cities of Mocuba and Nampula in Mozambique. The work was hard. Oyele did many things to relax that he knew broke God’s law.

Oyele got drunk after work. Several strangers came to him and asked if he knew that the Bible taught that the Sabbath was the seventh day of the week. Oyele was convinced the strangers were wrong. Oyele said, “Show me from the Bible.”

The strangers told Oyele they were Seventh-day Adventists. They opened the Bible and read the fourth commandment: “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy” (Exodus 20:8, NKJV). Then they turned to Ezekiel 20:20 and read, “Keep my Sabbaths holy. They will be a sign between me and you. Then you will know that I am the Lord your God” (ICB).

Oyele read the verses again and again during the next few days. He wondered if he was reading the real truth from God. Oyele had gone to church since he was a boy. But he never noticed the Sabbath verses before.

While Oyele prayed, a shining angel appeared at night over the house where he stayed. The angel said, “Stay strong! You are on the correct road.” The next night, Oyele saw the angel again. The angel said, “Stay strong! You are on the correct road.” The same thing happened the third night. Oyele went to a Seventh-day Adventist church the next Sabbath. After that, Oyele worshiped every week with Adventists.

Soon Oyele’s work contract was finished. Oyele went home. To his surprise, he learned that his wife and children had joined the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Oyele had not communicated with them during the three years he was away. Then Oyele’s wife learned that he had been going to a Seventh-day Adventist church. She was as surprised as he was.

Oyele wasn’t sure what to do. Now that Oyele was home, he went to the Adventist church on Saturdays and his childhood church on Sundays. The angel appeared for a fourth time. The angel said, “What you are studying about the Sabbath is God’s truth.” Oyele decided to become an Adventist right away.

Only a few Seventh-day Adventists live near Oyele. God blesses Oyele’s efforts to share the Good News that Jesus is coming soon. Oyele has helped start three house churches. He says, “Share the Good News about Jesus with people, even if they’re drunk. God is the one who changes our hearts. God is getting many people ready to accept the Good News. These people are waiting for you to touch their hearts.”
