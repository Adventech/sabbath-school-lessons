### Sara Knows the Answer!

_by Andrew McChesney_

In Italy, schoolchildren may attend an hour of religion class every week in public school. As a small girl, Sara decided to go because she wanted to learn more about the Bible.

Sara’s classmates soon learned that Sara knew the Bible well. So, when the teacher asked a question, the students said, “Sara knows the answer!”

The teacher asked Sara, “How do you know the Bible so well?”

Sara said, “I go to the Seventh-day Adventist Church.”

The teacher wanted to know more. So, she went to church with Sara.

Sara got a new religion teacher in the 6th grade. Again, Sara answered all the teacher’s questions about the Bible. The teacher was amazed at how much Sara knew. So, the teacher invited Sara to give an hour-long talk to the class about the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Sara got help from her pastor and other church leaders. At the end of Sara’s talk, her classmates asked her questions about the seventh-day Sabbath.

Today, Sara is in high school, and her religion teacher is a nun. A nun is a Catholic woman who promises to serve God all her life and lives with other nuns in a special religious community. During an exam, Sara amazed the nun when she wrote a Bible verse in one of her answers. Other teenagers didn’t often write Bible verses on their exams. The nun asked Sara to explain how she knew the Bible so well. Sara told the nun about her faith. After that, the nun came to Sara’s church.

In another high school class, a teacher got upset when Sara couldn’t answer a question about the Catholic religion. Sara explained that she didn’t know the answer because she wasn’t a member of the Catholic Church. Then the teacher asked Sara questions about her faith and invited Sara to give the class a lesson about the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Sara’s lesson pleased the teacher, who said, “It’s wonderful to learn about another faith in our class.”

The next year Sara had a class on Saturday from the same teacher. The teacher kept trying to get Sara to attend. The teacher said, “Please come to school. We won’t tell anyone you came.” For weeks, the teacher made fun of Sara. To Sara’s surprise, the class started to take her side against the teacher.

Then one Sabbath, when Sara was in church, the teacher praised Sara to the class. The teacher said, “Sara is only here half the time. But she gets better grades than the rest of you!”

Sara knows God has blessed her for being a strong and loyal Christian. She says, “I do not hide my faith from anyone. My classmates respect me and know my faith is important to me.”
