### Sara’s Choice: Somersaults or the Sabbath?

_by Andrew McChesney_

Seven-year-old Sara loved to do acrobatic stunts, which are also named gymnastics. Gymnastics were easy for Sara to do. She was very good at it. She really liked to do cartwheels, which are a special type of somersault. In a cartwheel, you put your hands on the ground and bring your legs, one at a time, over your head. Then you land on your feet again. Sara could do cartwheel after cartwheel in a row. She only stopped when she fell down.

Sara loved something more than she loved gymnastics. She loved God.

So, Sara didn’t want to miss church when her gymnastics coach announced that a big acrobatic show would be held on Sabbath in her hometown of Iesi, Italy. The show happened only one time each year. At the show, children showed their parents and families what they had learned that year in gymnastics.

Sara felt sad when her coach said that the gymnastics show was going to be held on the Sabbath.

At home, Mother saw Sara’s sad face. Mother said, “God can solve any problem.” Mother told Sara to tell her problem to God.

That evening, Sara prayed. “Dear God, I am very sad to hear the news that I will miss the show. But I want to honor You.”

Sara and the other children met to practice gymnastics every Tuesday and Thursday. The coach announced the date for the gymnastics show on a Tuesday. Sara prayed that Tuesday night and again on Wednesday night.

At the Thursday meeting, the coach announced that the date for the gymnastics show had changed. She said, “We have to delay the show for one day because of some problems. So, the show will now be on Sunday.”

Sara was surprised. She was so happy! When she told her mother the good news a little later, Mother smiled.

Mother said, “You must trust God always!”

Sara always has. This experience was her first big answer to prayer. The experience made Sara’s faith in God grow strong. On Sabbath, Sara told the church about what happened. A church member preached a special sermon about Sara’s prayer. Then he invited Sara up to the front of the church to tell her story about what God did for her.

Sara is now 19. She says, “I always pray to God to solve my problems in life.”
