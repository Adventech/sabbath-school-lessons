### A Safe Place

_by Andrew McChesney_

Ukrainian pastor Vadym Krynychnny had a big problem. He needed to find a building for his church in the city of Valencia in Spain. Vadym prayed. God answered his prayer. Soon, Vadym found a hall in the city center. The hall was big enough for 100 people and cost only 500 euros ($550 dollars in U.S. money) a month. Vadym said, “The building is worth much more than we are paying for it.”

26 people started to meet in the hall for church each Sabbath. Vadym started many programs to invite the community to join them. The church held a get-together with a meal on Sundays. The church invited children who spoke the Russian language to come to special programs for kids. The church also held meetings during religious holidays. They held music concerts, too. People loved the concerts. They filled the hall. Often, the church needed to rent a bigger hall to fit all the guests who came.

The church became well-known in the local community. The church became a center for people who spoke the Russian language. About 80 percent of Spain’s 400,000 Russian-speaking people live in Valencia and along the nearby Mediterranean coast. At least 500 of these 400,000 people are Adventist.

The first person baptized at the new church was not from Russia. The woman was born in Iran. She grew up in the Muslim religion. She learned the Russian language after studying it for 12 years. The Iranian woman came to the church after someone invited her while she was walking down the street.

Soon 25 people were baptized. Several Adventist families gave their hearts to Jesus again. Each week, 65 men and women and 40 children came to worship at the hall on Sabbath. That was in 2021. At that time, the war in Ukraine started.

Vadym started a center for citizens who were trying to escape from the war. Two months after the fighting started in Ukraine, 200 Ukrainian people visited his church. The church gave the 200 Ukrainians food and shelter. About half of these Ukrainian people were Adventists. Since that time, Vadym has helped many more people.

Vadym says, “Many people who came to us didn’t know anyone in Spain. But they heard that we speak the Russian language.”

Vadym gives God all the glory for putting the church in the right place before the war started so that they can help people now. Vadym wants to share the hope of Jesus’ Second Coming with all the people who speak the Russian language in Spain.

Your 13th Sabbath Offering will help our church share the Good News in the area of Euro-Asia, where many people who speak the Russian language live. Thank you for your offering.
