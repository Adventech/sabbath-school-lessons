### Running From Church, Part 2

_by Andrew McChesney_

Aneliya’s two sons gave their hearts to Jesus after her family left their country and moved to Europe. Then Aneliya’s sons asked their mother to accept Jesus as her Savior.

20-year-old Rosen asked, “Mother, don’t you want to be saved?” Aneliya exploded the same as a volcano. She pounded the table with her fist. “I’ll keep my religion until I die!”

Aneliya’s 22-year-old son, Sergei, told his mother about how Jesus died on the cross for people’s sins and woke up from the dead on the third day. Aneliya said, “He couldn’t do that!”

Sergei said, “If you believe in Jesus, and you die, God will wake you up from the dead, too.”

Later, Sergei read John 3:36 to his mother: “ ‘Whoever believes in the Son has eternal [everlasting] life. But those [people] who do not obey the Son will never have that life. They cannot get away from God’s anger’ ” (ERV).

Sergei told his mother, “We die, but when Jesus comes back, we will wake up from the dead.”

Aneliya asked, “My son, how can we wake up from our graves?” This question was a big one for Aneliya. How can people wake up from the dead and live forever?

Sergei said, “We will live again.”

As Aneliya listened to her sons read verses from the Bible, she started to understand. Soon she also started to understand what she heard about Jesus when she first visited church. Joy filled Aneliya’s heart. Aneliya later understood that the Holy Spirit entered her heart. Soon Aneliya accepted Jesus as her Savior. When she did that, she wanted to spend time with Him and worship Him at church.

Then Aneliya’s 15-year-old daughter was baptized. Aneliya didn’t go to the baptisms of her two sons. But she went to her daughter’s baptism. Aneliya’s daughter said, “It’s your turn next, Mother.”

Sergei gave Bible studies to his mother. She also studied the Bible on her own. She wished to live for Jesus. Then the day came when she got baptized. She was 47 years old. Aneliya says, “I was so happy. I can’t explain how much joy I felt in my heart. It was the first time in 47 years that I felt so much joy. I believed and accepted Jesus as my Savior.”

Today, Aneliya is 48. She teaches her people about Jesus. Her husband accepted the Bible, and his parents back in their home country keep the Sabbath now. Aneliya gives Bible studies to her community. She says, “I wanted to run away from church. But now I want to run to church. The Holy Spirit brought me to God.”
