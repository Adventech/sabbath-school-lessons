> <p>Memory Verse</p>
> “Then the dragon was very angry at the woman. He went off to make war against all her other children. Her children are those [people] who obey God’s commands and have the truth that Jesus taught” (Revelation 12:17, ICB).

After the Big Disappointment, in 1844, the first Adventists studied the Bible carefully. They learned that the law was an important part of God’s work in heaven’s temple. The Adventists understood that the Sabbath was important, too. The Sabbath shows us that Jesus made us. This Bible truth is our reason for worshiping God. Worship will be an important test during the final days of earth’s history (Revelation 14:6–12).

Satan doesn’t want anyone to worship God. So, Satan makes people think God’s law isn’t important. Satan knows if you keep the law but “fail to obey only one command, you are guilty of breaking all the commands in that law” (James 2:10, ERV). So, Satan works hard to get people to break God’s law. Satan hates the Sabbath. The Sabbath helps people remember that God made them.

This week, we will study the connection between God’s temple, His law, the Sabbath, and the mark of the beast. We also will study how the Sabbath is important to God’s end-time people.
