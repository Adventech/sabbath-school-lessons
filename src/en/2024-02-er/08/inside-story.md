### Running From Church, Part 1

_by Andrew McChesney_

Church was the last place that Aneliya wanted to go. Aneliya grew up in a non-Christian religion. So, Aneliya was surprised when her husband and their 20-year-old son, Rosen, accepted a Bible from a stranger on the street.

The stranger told them, “Take this Bible and come to our meeting this evening at my church. We’re serving food, too.”

Aneliya didn’t want to accept the invitation to go to church. She asked her husband and son, “What are we going to do there? I don’t want to go. I belong to another religion.”

But Rosen wanted to go to church. Rosen said to his mother, “Come. We’ll eat and hear a few things.”

All five members of the family went to the meeting in the European city where they lived. Aneliya and her family came to this city for safety after having to leave their country. At the church, church members greeted Aneliya and her family. Then they drank tea and ate cake together. During the church program, Aneliya heard people talking about Jesus, but she had a hard time understanding what they meant.

Aneliya wondered, “What are they talking about?” This was the first time she heard people talk about the Bible.

Rosen loved the meeting. Afterward, he started Bible studies with Paul, the man who gave him the Bible on the street.

Not long after, Rosen asked his mother to come to church for his baptism. Aneliya said, “What is baptism? I don’t understand what that is. I won’t go.” When Rosen was baptized, his mother wasn’t there.

Then Aneliya and her family were forced to leave the apartment they rented. They had money. But no one would rent an apartment to them. Church members invited the family to stay for a while in the children’s Sabbath School classroom.

Church was the last place Aneliya wanted to go. But she had no choice. She and her family lived in the church for seven months. During that time, Paul visited the family and read to them from the Bible. Aneliya wondered why Paul read the Bible. She was convinced that only her religion’s holy writings were truth. Aneliya wondered, “How will this Bible help me get an apartment? Why can’t we find one?”

On Sabbaths, Paul invited the family to come to church. Aneliya and her family were staying in the church at this time. As soon as Aneliya saw the meetings start, she ran out the door of the church. But the sermons touched the heart of her 22-year-old son, Sergei. Sergei got baptized.

After the family found a home, both of Aneliya’s sons asked their mother to accept Jesus.

The story finishes next week.
