> “We do have a high priest [top spiritual leader] who sits on the right side of God’s throne in heaven. Our high priest serves in the Most Holy Place. He serves in the true [real] place of worship that was made by God, not by men” (Hebrews 8:1, 2, ICB).

William Miller preached that Jesus was coming on October 22, 1844. When Jesus didn’t come, some Millerites studied the 2,300 days again to understand their mistake. They discovered the 2,300 days was the time when Jesus came to heaven’s temple to clean it from sin. The Book of Leviticus talks about how God’s Holy Tent on earth was cleaned each year. Daniel 7 and 8 tell us that Jesus would clean the temple in heaven after the last of four kingdoms came to an end:

| Daniel 7 | Daniel 8 |
| --- | --- |
| Babylon | |
| Media-Persia | Media-Persia |
| Greece | Greece |
| Rome | Rome |
| God’s work as Judge | Jesus cleans the temple |

Daniel 7 and 8 show that Jesus’ work in the temple is the same as God’s final work as Judge. This week, we’ll look at Jesus’ work in heaven’s temple during the end times.
