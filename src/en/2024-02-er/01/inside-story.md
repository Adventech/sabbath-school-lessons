### Volcano, Fires, and COVID-19

_by Andrew McChesney_

Misael Delgado Rodríguez is a Bible worker from Cuba. He went to serve God on La Palma Island, which is part of the Canary Islands. The Canary Islands are in the Atlantic Ocean, west of the country of Morocco. Misael had a big problem his first Sabbath on La Palma. Only five people came to church.

So, Misael started to visit Adventists on La Palma who no longer came to church. He visited other people, too. A month later, Misael held his first baptism. He was so happy! But then COVID-19 stopped his work for God. Misael’s problems only got worse. A fire broke out in the north part of the island and destroyed the homes of some church members. Another fire broke out in the south. Then a volcano exploded for 85 days, filling the air with poison gas and ash. The volcano caused several earthquakes. Two church families lost everything.

During all these troubles, something wonderful happened. Three years after Misael came to La Palma, 45 people came to church each Sabbath. Also, seven people got baptized. Five more were getting ready for baptism. 15 more people were doing Bible studies with church members. What happened? Misael said prayer changed everything: “We pray every day at 7 a.m., 2 p.m., and 9 p.m. Each member prays for five people.”

Each church group got involved in doing work for God. Several church members offered people free Bible studies and copies of Ellen G. White’s book Steps to Christ. The church offered classes on its Facebook page. These classes helped meet the needs of families, young people, and children. The youth group in the church held mini-concerts on the street. Or they visited the sick and needy and sang songs to them. Church members gave people cards that they could exchange for food in supermarkets. The church also gave health classes, Bible studies, and handed out copies of The Desire of Ages and other books. The church opened a school where they trained members to share the Good News about Jesus with other people. Four small groups started to meet in homes.

Making friends for Jesus has been a success and has helped the church to grow, Misael said. When the volcano exploded, church members spent two months handing out masks and small books with health information about volcanos. Misael said, “Our church became well known because we did these things. Many of the 15 people taking Bible studies lost everything in the volcano. They say the terrible experience brought them to God.”

Misael looks back at his experience in the Canary Islands with joy. He said, “The beginning was very hard. Our church has suffered a lot. But God has blessed us in a wonderful way.”
