The Protestant leaders in the 1500s had something we all need. They had a reason for living. A famous scientist, Philip Cushman, talks about our need for a reason to live. In his book, The Empty Self, Cushman says that some people have nothing worth dying for. Nothing in life really matters to them. So, they have no reason to live.

But the men, women, and children of the Protestant Reformation were different. As we saw last week, the Protestant Reformation happened in the 1500s in Europe when religious leaders made big changes to the Catholic religion. These leaders rejected the false teachings of the Catholic church. The changes they made led to the start of the Protestant churches. The Protestants had an important reason for living. Their beliefs were important to them. They couldn’t reject their beliefs. If they did, that would be the same as rejecting who they were.

This week, we will look at how Bible truth changed the lives of the Protestants in the 1500s and gave them a reason for living. Our understanding of these Bible truths will help us get ready for the final test in the end times.
