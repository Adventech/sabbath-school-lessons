### Letters to the Rich and Famous

_by Rebeca Ruiz Laguardia_

My mother, a Spanish housewife, read a surprising quote in Christ’s Object Lessons that changed her life forever. The quote said, “There are many people who don’t know the special Bible truths for our time. These people include businessmen, powerful leaders, inventors and scientists, intelligent men, and pastors. We should try to share the Bible truth with them first. We must invite them to follow Jesus.”—Ellen G. White, Christ’s Object Lessons, page 230, adapted. After Mother read this quote, she wrote letters to the rich and famous for the next 35 years. Some of the people she wrote to included Spanish royalty, actors and singers, and Cuban leader Fidel Castro.

After my mother first read the quote from Christ’s Object Lessons, she wondered, “How can I, a housewife, share the Good News about Jesus with rich and famous people?” Then God gave Mother a plan. She watched talk shows on TV with famous guests. She read articles about them in newspapers and magazines. She looked for any hint that famous people were interested in spiritual things. As soon as she heard famous people on TV or the radio say, “I wish I had faith,” “I don’t believe in God,” or “I feel my heart is empty,” she wrote them a letter to introduce them to God.

My mother lost count of the number of letters she mailed. Many people answered Mother’s letters. Madrid’s mayor wrote, “I’m reading the Conflict of the Ages books. I’m in the chapter ‘The Awakening in Spain’ in The Great Controversy. It’s very interesting. I will keep reading.”

A bishop told my mother he was grateful for Steps to Christ and the Conflict of the Ages. The bishop wrote, “May God in His mercy do what needs to be done to bring us Bible truth.”

Another person who wrote my mother was Isabel, who was a doctor. Isabel gave up her job to become a nun. A nun is a Catholic woman who promises to serve God all her life and lives with other nuns in a special religious community. Isabel wrote and called my mother for many months. In Isabel’s first letter, she told my mother, “You can send me all the Bible books you want.” My mother did, and a “seed” of Bible truth was planted.

My mother says, “The most important thing to do is plant ‘seeds’ of Bible truth. The Lord says, ‘Do good wherever you go. After a while, the good you do will come back to you’ (Ecclesiastes 11:1, ERV).”
