### A Town in Nigeria With No Adventist Church

_by Andrew McChesney_

The Nigerian town of Umuacha is located in an important place in southeast Nigeria. The town has a big market. Crowds from nearby towns visit the market every day. But there was no Seventh-day Adventist church in Umuacha.

More than 70 years ago, Adventist churches had been started in all the towns around Umuacha. But Umuacha had no church.

Why? The first Christian church opened in Umuacha more than 80 years earlier. The members of this church wanted to be the only church in town. As the years passed, the townspeople sold their land to people from other towns and other Christian religions. These new people built their own churches. The first church accepted these new Christians. But the first church announced that they would never welcome Adventists in their town because they worshiped on a different day.

Adventist members from churches in a nearby town tried to start a church in Umuacha. When the Adventists tried to hold meetings, no one in Umuacha would rent them a building. Then the church in the nearby village of Mba held meetings for two weeks outside the town of Umuacha. After the meetings, the church members from Mba started a Sabbath School class. But the class closed after only three months. Later, young people from Mba held Bible studies that brought several Umuacha families to the church in Mba on Sabbaths. But the families stopped going when their neighbors threw stones at them.

In 2021, church leaders made new plans for meetings in Umuacha. Again, they had trouble finding a place for the meetings. One landowner agreed to hold the tent meetings on his property. But then he changed his mind all of a sudden.

Then a Seventh-day Adventist church member named Christian tried to find a place for meetings. As Christian searched for a place, he met Chilaka, who was the owner of a school. Chilaka offered his school for the meetings. Christian accepted with a thankful heart.

For a month, Adventist pastors preached the Good News about Jesus in Umuacha. A medical team joined the pastors. The team offered medical care to the sick. At the end of the meetings, 29 people were baptized. Then someone gave land to the Adventist church, and a church opened in Umuacha.

Caleb Ucheena Onyendi is a church leader in southeast Nigeria. Caleb said, “Today, the church is growing.”

Caleb added, “God does everything right on time, just as He says He will in Exodus 9:5: “The Lord has set the time for this to happen. He said, ‘Tomorrow the Lord will make this [thing] happen in this country’ ” (ERV). That’s just what He did in a town in Nigeria.
