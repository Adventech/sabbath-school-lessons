### No to Pork, Yes to Sabbath

_by Andrew McChesney_

Sara thought about Seventh-day Adventists while she helped her mother sell pork and beer in Mozambique. Mozambique is a country in southeast Africa. Sara wondered to herself, “Why do Seventh-day Adventists go to church on Saturday?”

When Sara was a small girl, she went to the Adventist church several times with her big brother. Sara’s big brother was a Seventh-day Adventist. But then Sara’s brother moved to another town. So, Sara went back to her mother’s church.

As Sara worked with her mother, she continued to think about the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Sara also wondered about her new Seventh-day Adventist neighbors who moved in next door. Sara decided to ask them why they went to church on Saturday.

The neighbors welcomed Sara’s question. They opened the Bible to Exodus 20:8–10. Sara read, “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor [get your job done] and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it [on this day] you shall do no work” (NKJV). Sara saw that Jesus worshiped on the 7th day when He lived on earth. So, she decided to keep the 7th-day Sabbath, too.

Mother was angry when Sara told her that she would no longer sell pork and beer on Saturdays. Mother refused to allow Sara to go to the Seventh-day Adventist church. Sara went anyway. She wanted to honor her mother as God commands in the fifth commandment (Exodus 20:12). But Sara also understood that she should “obey God instead of [we must put God first, ahead of] people” (Acts 5:29, NIrV).

Things got worse when Sara stopped selling pork and beer. Sara explained to Mother that God doesn’t want His people to eat pork or any other meat that isn’t clean (Leviticus 11:7). God also doesn’t want His people to drink alcohol (Proverbs 20:1). Sara told her mother that the Bible says, “So if you eat or drink or whatever you do, do everything to honor God” (1 Corinthians 10:31, NLV). Sara explained that she must honor God. She must not sell things that God didn’t like or accept.

Mother threw Sara out of the house. Sara moved in with her Adventist brother and his family. Sara’s heart was sad. She wondered, “Is this trouble the price I must pay to follow Jesus?”

Sara’s brother talked about her troubles with the leaders at his church. Then an Adventist pastor met with Mother. Mother listened carefully to what the pastor said. She didn’t agree with him on everything. But she said Sara could come back home.

Today, Mother is not a Christian. Sara prays for the Holy Spirit to touch her heart. Sara knows that the God who helped her to understand His love can do the same for her mother.
