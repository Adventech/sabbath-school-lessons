The Book of Revelation is more than symbols, wild beasts, and strange word pictures. Revelation is God’s end-time message to the final group of people living on the earth. The war between Jesus and Satan started in heaven over worship. The final war will be about worship, too.

`Compare Revelation 14:7, 9 with Revelation 4:11. What important ideas do these verses talk about?`

In the Book of Revelation, we see a connection between worship and God’s work as the One who made the skies and earth in six days. These two topics can’t be separated from each other. You can’t understand one without the other. Revelation 14:7 invites us to worship the Lord who made everything. The Sabbath helps us remember who we are. The Sabbath tells us God made us. He is worthy of our worship. This Bible truth is one reason the devil hates the Sabbath so much.

`In the final fight during the end times, how will we show our loyalty to the God who made us? Read Revelation 12:17 and Revelation 14:12 for the answer.`

In the end times, we will worship one of two powers: we will worship the God who made us, or we will worship the sea beast. We have only two choices. If we worship God, we show that we reject worshiping the beast. In the final fight, God’s people will stand loyal to Him. That time will be the most terrible time of suffering in human history.

“The governments of different countries will make a law that forces everyone to keep the false sabbath. This law goes against the fourth commandment. Anyone who keeps this law shows their loyalty to a power that rejects God. The ones who obey God’s law will keep the true Sabbath. Their Sabbath keeping shows their loyalty to the God who made them.”—Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy, page 605, adapted.

Revelation 14:12 says that Jesus’ loyal followers will have the “faith of Jesus” (KJV). The “faith of Jesus” is the same faith that Jesus had in God the Father. This faith is so deep that it helps us trust God when we can’t understand what we see. Jesus gives us this gift of faith. This faith will keep us loyal to God in the final fight.
