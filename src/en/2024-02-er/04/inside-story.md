### A Tale About Two Neighbors

_by Andrew McChesney_

Mussa’s religion taught that it is wrong to raise pigs for sale. But Mussa worked as a pig farmer.

Nicolonaga’s religion taught that it is wrong to divorce for any reason except cheating. But Nicolonaga married three times. Also, at separate times, he lived with three different women the same as wives without marrying any of them.

Mussa and Nicolonaga were neighbors in Mozambique. The two men’s lives didn’t match their religious beliefs. But God had a plan for them.

One of Mussa’s pigs escaped and ran into Nicolonaga’s vegetable garden. The pig destroyed many of Nicolonaga’s plants.

Nicolonaga was angry. He got into a fistfight with Mussa. Nicolonaga won the fight. Mussa limped away. He was covered with blood and bruises. But Mussa refused to give up the fight. He promised to get revenge with witchcraft. Mussa warned Nicolonaga, “You have 30 days to get ready to die.”

The next day, Nicolonaga woke up feeling very ill. He told his Adventist friends about Mussa’s promise to get revenge. Nicolonaga’s friends belonged to the church where he used to worship.

Nicolonaga continued to get worse. He grew worried. After 15 days, he asked church members to pray for him. The pastor brought a prayer team to Nicolonaga’s house.

But Nicolonaga didn’t get better. Another week passed. Nicolonaga didn’t have much time left. The pastor told church members to pray and fast for Nicolonaga for a whole night. Fasting is a short time when you don’t eat any food.

Early the next morning, Mussa knocked on the door of the pastor’s house. He told the pastor an amazing story about how his gods fought Nicolonaga’s God, and Nicolonaga’s God won. Mussa said he didn’t want to kill Nicolonaga anymore. Mussa wanted to become a Christian. He said, “I want to worship Nicolonaga’s God.”

Nicolonaga got well. Both he and Mussa joined a class to get baptized into the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Today, both men are powerful leaders for good in their community.

The pastor of their church, Nelson A. Quenesse, said, “God is all-powerful. He answers the prayers of the people who seek Him in faith. ‘Without faith no one can please God. Anyone who comes to God must believe that he is real and that he rewards those [people] who truly [keep on trying] want to find him’ (Hebrews 11:6, ERV).”
