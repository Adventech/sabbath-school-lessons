### Touching Hearts in Spa

_by Andrew McChesney_

Vadym Krynychnny was from Ukraine. He moved to Portugal to set up air conditioners. 20 years later, Vadym was the pastor of a church in Spain. Vadym’s church helped many people who came to Spain to escape the war in Ukraine. Vadym said, “We started with only a few members. But our church grew. God has blessed us.”

How did Vadym go from setting up air conditioners to becoming a pastor? What happened?

After Vadym left Ukraine with his wife, Alina, they started an air conditioning business in Portugal. Their business was a big success. Vadym and Alina became citizens of Portugal.

12 years later, their lives changed when they were asked to help a family who arrived in Portugal. The family didn’t speak the Portuguese language. They spoke only the Russian language. Vadym and Alina invited the family to go to church with them. The family accepted this offer and started to study the Bible with Vadym and Alina, too. Three months later, the family gave their hearts to Jesus and were baptized.

Vadym and Alina were so happy. They searched for more people to help. In 18 months, they started a church with 20 people. Vadym preached every Sabbath. Alina was in charge of the music. Vadym says, “Alina and I were very tired at the end of every Sabbath. But we were filled with so much joy, too, from all the work we did for God.”

Vadym and Alina believed that God wanted them to work only for Him. They wanted to win people for God’s kingdom. So, Vadym and Alina closed their business. They moved to Sagunto Adventist College in Spain. Vadym finished school four years later after studying to become a pastor.

Then Vadym started a Bible group with 20 people who spoke the Russian language. The group met every Sabbath afternoon for Bible studies. Visitors to the group were invited to church. Before long about 10 visitors went to church each week. The Sabbath afternoon group kept growing. Vadym says, “We saw that people had a need to get together with people who spoke their own language.” Soon the group grew to 26 members. They became a church, with help and support from the Adventist Church in Spain. Vadiym says, “We want to serve all people who speak the Russian language. We want to bring them to Jesus. God has blessed us so much in our work.”

Your 13th Sabbath Offering next Sabbath will help the Seventh-day Adventist Church share the Good News about Jesus in the Euro-Asia Division, where many people live who speak the Russian language. Thank you for your offering. We will finish this story next week.
