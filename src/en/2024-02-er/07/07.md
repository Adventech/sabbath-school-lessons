Look at the chart below. The chart shows us two of Daniel’s special messages about time: the 70 weeks and the 2,300 days. Both time messages start in 457 B.C. Both time messages tell us things about the Savior. The 70-week time message is all about Jesus. Daniel’s messages about Jesus happened just as the Bible promised. So, we can trust that the 2,300 days end in the year 1844.

“William Miller and his friends did not understand everything about the message God gave them to preach. They had wrong ideas about Bible truth. These wrong ideas kept them from understanding an important part of the special message about time. So, they were sad when Jesus didn’t come back when they thought He would.”—Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy, pages 351, 352, adapted.

“God had a reason for allowing Miller to preach his message the way he did. God’s work as Judge would start soon. So, God in His mercy tested His people. God gave them a test about time to show them what was in their hearts. God sent this message to test the church and make it clean. God caused His people to see what they loved more: the things of this life, or Him and heaven. God’s people said they loved their Savior. Now they must give proof of their love. Were God’s people ready to give up their hopes and plans for this life? Were they ready to welcome with joy their Lord’s coming? The message that Miller preached was the test that showed God’s people if they were really spiritual. God sent His people this test in mercy. This test was meant to wake His people up. The test was meant to cause God’s people to seek Him. The test was meant to help His people give up their sins and empty their hearts of all pride.”—Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy, page 353, adapted.

**Discussion Questions**:

`What can we learn from William Miller’s experience? How does God use our mistakes to test and bless us?`

`Why is it important to understand Daniel 9:24–27? How does this time message help us trust the Bible?`
