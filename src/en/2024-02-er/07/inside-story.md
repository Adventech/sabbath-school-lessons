### Opening Hearts

_by F. Edgar Nunes_

Not long ago, a mother and daughter from Syria came to worship at the Kingston Seventh-day Adventist Church in Ontario, Canada. As the church’s pastor, I always am happy to meet any visitor. What made these two visitors so special was that they belonged to another worldwide religion. How did they hear about us? Who invited them to our church?

Long before the mother and her daughter came to church, they became friends with Shirley, one of our church members.

Shirley has a big heart for strangers and people who have left their own countries to escape war and suffering. Many of these people had to leave home because they were tortured for their faith or religious beliefs. Shirley welcomes people with a warm smile. Shirley loves to help in any way she can. Her love touches people’s hearts. That’s why they accept her invitations to family dinners and summer picnics. The Syrian mother and daughter were named Eman and Heba. Shirley invited them to come to church on Sabbath. Eman and Heba accepted the invitation.

After worship, I visited with Eman and Heba outside the church. Eman and Heba were happy to talk. They accepted my offer to pray for them. Then I asked them if they would like to have a copy of the Book of John in the Arabic language.

Eman accepted the book. She said, “We believe that Jesus is a special messenger from God. So, my daughter and I will read the book.”

A few days later, Shirley called me on the phone to ask me if I spoke the Sudanese language. She explained, “I met another family from Africa that I want you to visit.”

Shirley’s love and care for strangers keeps opening hearts. Her example helps us to want to work the same as Jesus did. “Only Jesus’ plan will give us real success in touching people’s hearts. The Savior made friends with people. He wanted the best for them. He showed love for them and took care of their needs. He earned their trust. Then He told them, ‘Follow Me.’ ”—Ellen G. White, The Ministry of Healing, page 143, adapted.

Shirley is friendly. She listens to people, serves them, and shows them love. She cares for them. Her love and care help break the “walls” that separate most people from Jesus. We can win hearts as Shirley does every day.

Jesus said, “ ‘All people will know that you are my followers if you love each other’ ” (John 13:35, ERV). When we have Jesus’ love in our hearts, people will open their hearts to us. This love is the same love that will cause people to want to become Jesus’ followers.
