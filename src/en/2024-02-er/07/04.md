God used William Miller to help people understand the Bible truth about the Second Coming. As Miller studied the Bible, he discovered a loving Savior. Jesus loved him more than he thought possible. With the Bible, a pen, and a notebook, Miller started reading the Bible from the beginning. Miller made sure he understood every verse he read before he studied a new verse. Miller also compared the verses he studied with other verses in the Bible. In this way, Miller allowed the Bible to explain itself.

`Read Isaiah 28:9, 10; Proverbs 8:8, 9; John 16:13; and 2 Peter 1:19–21. What important rules about understanding the Bible do you read about in these verses?`

William Miller compared Bible verse with Bible verse. As Miller followed this plan, the Holy Spirit showed Miller what the verses meant. Miller searched for Bible truth the same as for hidden treasure. God richly rewarded his efforts. Miller studied the Bible’s special messages about the future with the same carefulness.

`Read Daniel 1:17; Daniel 2:45; 1 Peter 1:10, 11; and Revelation 1:1–3. What do these verses teach us about how to understand the Bible’s special messages about time?`

The meaning of Bible symbols is not a mystery. A loving God gave us special messages in the Bible to help us get ready for the future. William Miller understood that the Bible explains its special messages. The Bible tells us the meaning of its symbols and word pictures. Wild animals are symbols of kings or kingdoms (Daniel 7:17, 23). Wind is a symbol of something that destroys (Jeremiah 49:36). Water is a symbol for people (Revelation 17:15). A woman is a symbol for a church (Jeremiah 6:2; Ephesians 5:22–32). The special messages about time in the Books of Daniel and Revelation are written in symbols. In these books, one day equals one real year (Numbers 14:34; Ezekiel 4:6). Miller used these Bible rules to help him understand the Bible. Soon he became surprised at what the Bible taught about the time when Jesus would come back.

`Why is it so important for us to understand the correct meaning for the Bible’s symbols?`
