#### Part I: Overview

Study Focus: John 21:1–19, John 21:18–25, John 8:40–46, John 4:46–54, John 12:32, John 15:1–11

At the conclusion, or epilogue, of John’s Gospel, Christ sought to instill the teachings of His spiritual kingdom, His vicarious death, and His sure resurrection in His followers’ hearts as well as in their minds. His disciples, however, even to the end, did not seem to internalize the truth of what He said. No matter how many times He tried to explain this truth to them and lead them to believe, they found it quite difficult to process.

Lest we become too hard on the disciples, isn’t this the problem with many Christians today? We hear the words of Christ and study them, but do they really become an integral part of our lives? Do they stay in our heads without reaching our hearts?

It is hard to believe, but true, that Peter and the other disciples thought that, during His earthly ministry, Christ was going to restore the literal kingdom to Israel by defeating the Roman power. After the Resurrection, the hope of the two disciples was crushed as they traveled to Emmaus. And as Jesus (unrecognized by them as the Savior) joined them, He explained to them the prophecies concerning Himself. Moreover, the reality of the Resurrection, and, shortly afterward, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, helped to actualize what He had taught the Twelve all along. Finally, it became so real to the disciples that they were willing to risk their lives for the cause of the gospel.

It seems that, in those last few weeks with the resurrected Lord, the disciples finally learned and believed more about what Jesus was trying to tell them. He was long-suffering with them to the very end, and He is as willing to be patient with us today. What would we do without His patience? May this thought help to inspire us to be more faithful in our minds, in our hearts, and in our living.

#### Part II: Commentary

**Meeting in Galilee (John 21:1–19)**

Even after the resurrected Lord appeared three times to the disciples, at the suggestion of Peter, they went back to fishing. They labored all night but had nothing to show for their efforts. Normally, they would have caught something, however small the catch. But Jesus intended that this failure would lead them to focus on being fishers of men. Our failure in something that we do well often leads us to seek divine aid.

Early that morning, Jesus showed up on the shore, performed the miracle of the great catch of fish, and then fed His followers breakfast. This story tells us that the risen Christ was a real person, just as He was before His death. Moreover, in preparing food, Jesus showed that He cared about the needs of His tired and hungry disciples. In doing so, Jesus showed them He would ever be their friend, caring about their needs as they endeavored to advance His ministry.

It is telling that, in this last meeting, the Lord focused on Peter. Right after His resurrection, Jesus specifically mentioned Peter by name, and now He singled him out again and asked him three pertinent questions concerning a most important subject—that of loving Him. Earlier, as Jesus was telling the disciples about His impending crucifixion, Peter insisted that he would die for Him (John 13:37). But in spite of that promise, Peter and the other disciples fled for their lives, thinking that their cause was lost. Later, Peter denied Christ three times, just as Jesus had predicted.

In the Mideastern culture, it’s shameful to deny one’s friends, and Peter keenly felt that shame. Knowing the shame that Peter felt, Jesus asked him three questions that were designed to assist in his healing and restoration. Three times Jesus asked him, by name: “ ‘Simon, son of Jonah, do you love Me?’ ” (John 21:16, NKJV). Jesus used the Greek verb agapao, which refers to God’s unconditional love, and Peter answered with the verb phileo, which often refers to loving a friend.

It seems that Peter did not feel that his love for his Lord was as elevated as his Lord’s love for him. Here, in his answer, Peter was showing humility and teachableness, traits that qualified him to “feed my sheep” (John 21:16). This gesture on Christ’s part proved that Peter was now restored and entrusted with taking care of Christ’s flock of believers. What a change! The impulsive and overconfident Peter had finally learned to be humble, distrusting self and trusting Jesus.

**Keeping Your Eyes on Jesus (John 21:18–25)**

It is justifiable to say that there seemed to be a sort of “competition” going on between two of Christ’s prominent disciples: Peter and John. Both were vying for His attention. Jesus had just finished restoring Peter before his fellow disciples and committing to him the pastoral care of His sheep. Amid this work of rehabilitation, Jesus included the prediction of how Peter was going to give his life for the gospel. (See John 21:18, 19.) Then Jesus called on Peter to follow Him, which was the only way to remain faithful and strong through the ebb and flow of ministry and even martyrdom.

As Peter walked with Christ, John was nearby. That apparently made Peter curious. If Peter was to suffer, was not John to suffer as well? After all, the call to follow was made specifically to him. That is why Peter asked: “ ‘But Lord, what about this man [John]?’ ” (John 21:21, NKJV). Knowing what was in Peter’s heart, Jesus quickly responded: “ ‘If I will that he remain till I come, what is that to you? You follow Me’ ” (John 21:22, NKJV).

Simply put, what Jesus was trying to convey to Peter is that the priority of following Him does not depend on who else does or upon what circumstances may arise. Peer pressure may lead us to veer this way or that, but we must be fully committed to Jesus, regardless of people or circumstances. This mindset is desperately needed today, when people tend to follow whims or public opinion. But, as faithful followers of Jesus, we cannot do that. We must follow Him because of our own personal convictions in Him as Savior because our salvation is a matter between us and God. When Jesus comes again, it will not matter what others think of us; it will only matter what God thinks of us.

We should not leave this section without addressing a potential misunderstanding that may arise in the minds of many concerning Jesus’ words about John. Jesus’ focus was on Peter’s need to follow Him regardless, not on what was going to happen to John. Notice the conditional statement: “ ‘If I will that he remain’ ” (John 21:22, NKJV). It was rather easy for Peter, and easy for us, to needlessly misconstrue Jesus’ clear words and miss His main point of remaining faithful.

At times, even our closest friends may misinterpret what we say. However, our best Friend Jesus understands fully what we say and mean. Consider this inspired statement in terms of putting our full trust in the unchangeable Jesus: “In His mercy and faithfulness God often permits those in whom we place confidence to fail us, in order that we may learn the folly of trusting in man and making flesh our arm. Let us trust fully, humbly, unselfishly in God.”—Ellen G. White, The Ministry of Healing, p. 486.

**Light and Darkness (John 8:40–46)**

There are some people who are determined to hold on to their mistaken opinions, no matter how much evidence they see to the contrary. They also tend to gather around themselves only those who agree with them, thus serving to reinforce their own errors.

Such was the case with the religious leaders. They were so blinded by their own self-centeredness and prejudice that they hated Jesus with a passion. It is so strange that they claimed to love the Father yet hated His Son. Jesus exposed this hypocrisy in these words: “ ‘If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I proceeded forth and came from God; nor have I come of Myself, but He sent Me’ ” (John 8:42, NKJV).

**Jesus Heals the Jewish Nobleman’s Son (John 4:46–54).**

In our study this week, we also consider the story of an eminent Jewish nobleman, who is an important officer in King Herod’s service. The nobleman’s son languished on his deathbed. All physicians had given up on him. In desperation, the father sought after the Great Physician, even though he did not really believe that He was the promised Messiah. Jesus knew that unless He healed the nobleman’s son, he would not believe that He was the Christ.

Although Jesus knew the man’s motives, He desired not only to heal his son but also to awaken genuine faith in the man and to bring salvation to the entire family. Jesus remarked to the nobleman, “ ‘Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will by no means believe’ ” (John 4:48, NKJV). These words pricked the father’s conscience and led him to question his selfish motives, setting him on a path of believing in Jesus for His own sake.

**Abiding in Jesus (John 12:32, John 15:1–11)**

When Jesus was “lifted up from the earth” (John 12:32), He drew many unto Himself, and He still draws many today. But being drawn to Christ is just the initial step in our saving relationship with Him, for we must continue to walk with Him and abide in Him, which requires determination and steadiness in our spiritual journey.

To highlight the importance of abiding in Him, Jesus mentions it seven times in only four verses, found in John 15:4–7. Without abiding in Christ, we “can do nothing” (John 15:5). The meaning of this verse becomes quite clear when we consider the real-life example of grafting a cutting into a vine. If the graft doesn’t adhere to the parent stock, it will dry up. Thus, without the parent stock, the graft can do absolutely nothing.

The quality of abiding conveys the idea of intimacy and permanency. The fruitful branch has a living connection with the vine. “Fiber by fiber and vein by vein, [the graft will] become knit with the Vine, and partake of its life. . . . As the graft receives life when united to the vine, so the sinner partakes of the divine nature when connected with Christ. Finite man is united with the infinite God. When thus united, the words of Christ abide in us, and we are not actuated by a spasmodic feeling, but a living, abiding principle.”—Ellen G. White, Sons and Daughters of God, p. 291.

#### Part III: Life Application

Think about and answer the following questions:

1.	Consider what happens when we place too much trust in people, even in our best friends, instead of in Jesus. In such situations, God, in His great love and mercy for us, allows such friends to disap­point us so that we may finally learn to place our ultimate trust in Jesus. To what extent, then, should we trust our best friends?

2.	When we know and believe that God has forgiven us, is it all right to believe fully in that forgiveness but not fully forgive ourselves, knowing that we don’t deserve that forgiveness? Why, or why not?

3.	Knowing that someday we may face the time of trouble alone, how dependent should we be on other Christians around us? Do we still need others to prop us up, or have we learned to draw strength from our companionship with Jesus? Explain.

4.	What does it really mean to you, in everyday life, that without Jesus you can do nothing? Specifically, what does that “nothing” refer to?
