#### Part I: Overview

Study Focus: John 18:38, John 19:4–22, John 20:19–31

Jesus spoke with confidence and certainty about His identity. Often, He alluded to His identity as the fulfillment of the promised Messiah and asked others to attest to His Messiahship. Why was their witness on behalf of His identity so important to Jesus? He wanted to save as many as possible into His eternal kingdom, and He knew that believing in Him was the only way to be saved from sin and this fallen world.

Jesus also appealed to many of His eyewitnesses to express their sincere convictions about their tangible experiences with Him. Mary’s testimony about Jesus’ sacrifice was powerful and meaningful. Her heart was totally open to His eyes, as all our hearts are, for Jesus knows the depth of every heart. Thus, He also knew the caviling and conniving heart of Judas.

Jesus likewise read the heart of Pontius Pilate, a heathen Roman gover­nor who was in some ways more truthful than many of Jesus’ accusers. Jesus also received the testimony of a doubter who had to see and touch for himself the evidence of His Lord’s resurrection. Jesus was patient with Thomas and showed him the clear evidence of His scarred body. This week, we also will study the most powerful witness of the Savior’s Messiahship—Jesus Himself, who testifies of His Messianic mission through His words of eternal life and through His mighty deeds.

#### Part II: Commentary

**Harking Back to Abraham**

John 8:56 implies that Abraham was shown a revelation of the future Messiah. This divine disclosure of glorious hope was meant to serve as confirmation of God’s universal plan of salvation. Upon beholding this magnificent revelation, Abraham “rejoiced” and was “glad.” By contrast, the Jewish leaders needed no vision to see Christ’s day, for they saw Him and His mighty works in person. Instead of being joyous, as their father Abraham was, they were instead angry and ready to kill Him.

Moreover, Abraham was shown a practical application of that vision, which revealed the graphic plan of human redemption. Abraham served as a type of God the Father, and Isaac as a type of Jesus, God’s only Son. The wood for the sacrifice was carried on Isaac’s back to the altar, just as Christ carried the wooden cross to the altar of Calvary. Both Isaac and Jesus, without any objection, were willing to be the sacrifice. It is hard to believe that a strapping young man such as Isaac, in the prime of his youth, would be so obedient, even unto death. Abraham’s incredible faith, yet painful reluctance, in sacrificing his only son—the son of promise—typified the Father’s willingness to let Jesus die for humanity.

The main difference between Jesus and Isaac was the substitute that was provided for the latter. But nothing was provided for Jesus. Christ’s sacrifice was indeed to be the Substitute for us all. In shedding His blood, Jesus gave for our redemption His life and His righteousness, which no one else possessed.

**The Witness of Mary**

As we turn our attention to the feast at the house of Simon the Pharisee, we must note that Jesus is the guest of honor, along with Lazarus, whom He had just raised from the dead. Mary, on the other hand, is not an honored guest. Simon and Mary are a case study in contrasts. Jesus had cleansed Simon from leprosy, but Simon had not yet permitted Jesus to heal him from the leprosy of his sinful choices. By contrast, Mary surrendered fully to Jesus and permitted Him to cleanse her from the leprosy of her sinful past. Simon felt obligated, in accordance with Jewish custom, to honor Jesus for healing him, and thus he invited Jesus out of a sense of duty. But Mary was completely committed and devoted to Jesus, spreading the fragrance of His love throughout the house. At the feast, she anointed the body of Christ, the soon-to-be-slain Lamb of God who was the vicarious Sacrifice sent to save sinful humanity.

Jesus came to Mary’s defense when she became the focus of everyone’s attention. Judas orchestrated a verbal assault against her for anointing Jesus, an assault that was supported by the disciples. Jesus described Mary’s act of devotion to Jesus as a wonderful thing because she did what she could for Him. Therefore, when we do our part out of genuine love, Jesus accepts such an effort as our best offering, for He knows the inner workings of a genuine heart. When we do our best for Jesus, He considers that good enough. If it is good enough for Jesus, it should be good enough for us, as well.

**The Unwitting Witness of Pilate (John 18:38, John 19:4–22)**

It is surprising and ironic that a pagan governor would, in a sense, take the side of Jesus, and proclaim His innocence, while Jesus’ own people, whom He had come to save, rejected Him, clamoring for His death. Living and governing in a very corrupt world, Pilate desired to know the truth, but he was doubtful that it existed. Such doubts about the existence of truth are prevalent, especially today. Truth is misconstrued as lies, as nothing but power ploys, and the light is labeled darkness used to subjugate the ignorant. Deceit is becoming increasingly normalized in our society. And, like Pilate, we cry out to know the truth.

Hence, what Jesus said to Thomas is so true and indispensable for our times: “ ‘I am the way, the truth, and the life’ ” (John 14:6). In these last days, we need to walk with Jesus, who is the Way. As we walk with Him, He teaches us the truth, by word and deed, which finally leads to eternal life. It is easy to become discouraged and even disillusioned as we are confronted with the happenings of our world; therefore, we must embrace Jesus, who is always the truth and in whom there is no trace of the darkness found in this life. He is constant, for He is the same yesterday, today, and forever.

A final thought about Pilate: he knew in his heart that Jesus was not just innocent. He also was convicted that Jesus was extraordinary in every way. Pilate never had witnessed anyone like Him. His wife confirmed this conviction by sharing the truth about Jesus with him and warning him not to condemn Him. In fact, Pilate himself pronounced Jesus innocent—not once, but three times.

But, as many do, Pilate succumbed to the pressure of the mob. He vacillated in a moment of weakness, thus violating his conscience. Pilate tried to please both Rome and the mob, but he ended up pleasing neither. Stripped of all his honors and exiled to Gaul, in France, Pilate’s heavy depression overwhelmed him, and he took his own life.

**The Witness of Thomas (John 20:19–31)**

Thomas’s case is quite a lesson book in faith and trust. Like Pilate, Thomas struggled with doubt, in spite of abundant evidence. But Jesus was willing to assuage his fears and misgivings. The Savior was gentle with Thomas, inviting him to touch His scars. Jesus also wants us to “come and see,” to experience Him personally for ourselves. It seems that whatever it takes to help us believe, He is willing to provide. He meets us where we are—in our despair, discouragement, or doubt.

John often deals with the topic of doubt in his writings. When he wrote his Gospel, he was confronting discouraged church members who were challenged by Gnostic heresies about the reality of Christ. In John’s day, as in ours, there were those who chose not to believe because they did not see all the evidence they desired, be it scientific or philosophical.

Many today focus on every bit of doubt raised in objection to Christ’s Messiahship and, thus, ignore the massive evidence of Christ’s reality and mission. These doubters insist on the entire cup of evidence being filled to the brim before they choose to believe. But in this fallen world, there is always room for doubt. We are surrounded by evidence: God’s amazing creation, life itself, divine providence, our conscience, and the measure of faith with which we are born. With that kind of evidence, seeing truly is believing.

Such an experience is exactly what Elisha prayed for when He entreated the Lord to help his doubtful servant to see, as recorded in 2 Kings 6:17: “ ‘Lord, I pray, open his eyes that he may see’ ” (NKJV). The Bible tells us what transpired in answer to Elisha’s prayer: “Then the Lord opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw. And behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha” (NKJV). So, we may conclude that real seeing is believing the bigger reality beyond our immediate circumstances.

**The Witness of Jesus**

Jesus is indeed the greatest witness to His own divinity and divine mission. Repeatedly and tirelessly, He endeavored to open the eyes and hearts of the intellectual and rich classes. The Savior greatly desired those who doubted to consider the obvious evidence about Himself. He ardently yearned for them to believe and be saved, though it was often to no avail. How often many of us wish to see and hear Jesus in person! But had we lived during the earthly ministry of Christ and seen all the evidence He presented, would we have believed?

We now have the advantage of many fulfilled prophecies, which we may study to learn about His mighty works and life-giving words. There is life inherent in His words, for His recorded sayings are congruent with His person. As Peter testified, Jesus possesses the words of eternal life; Jesus Himself testified that His words give life.

Let us consider the weight of the countless testimonies of changed lives that have occurred because of an encounter with Christ. Christ’s power to convert the hardened and hopeless human heart is on full display for us to ponder and to fill us with wonder. Consider how Christ, through the Holy Spirit, forms Himself, the hope of glory, within us. We sometimes have the tendency to believe what we should not believe. People do not always mean what they say or say what they mean. On the other hand, the Fountain of Truth, Jesus, is the opposite. He always says what He means and means what He says. We can fully trust what He says and what He means.

#### Part III: Life Application

Think about and answer the following questions:

1.	The Pharisees were privileged to see firsthand what Jesus said and did, but they resisted believing in the One who was God’s inestimable Gift from heaven. Thomas doubted, as some of the Pharisees did, but eventually he believed. Compare and contrast the different attitudes toward Jesus in Thomas and the Pharisees. What was the essential difference?

2.	Christ did not pray for His own disciples only, as recorded in John 17:9; He also prayed for all future generations who would believe the disciples’ testimony, as seen in verse 20. “ ‘I do not pray for these alone, but also for those who will believe in Me through their word’ ” (NKJV). Doesn’t this assertion imply that we have become believers in Christ because of His prayers for us and others? What does this reality tell you about His amazing love, care, and divine power?

3.	Think about Pilate’s vacillation and divided loyalties. What are some of the adverse consequences of such defective leadership? How does trying to please all in an attempt to accommodate their diverse views bring about confusion and consternation?

4.	Our lives exude a “fragrance,” or influence, on the people around us as we interact with them in our different spheres. We cannot emit the sweet fragrance of Jesus unless we are “fragranced” by Him. As we reflect on our daily lives, does the atmosphere that surrounds us draw others to Christ or repulse them away from Him?
