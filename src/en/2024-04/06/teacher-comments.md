#### Part I: Overview

Study Focus: John 1:32–36, John 6:51–71, John 5:36–38, and John 7:37–53

In this lesson, we further explore the testimony of John the Baptist. John was not confused or doubtful as to the identity of Christ. At every turn, John pointed to Jesus as the Son of God and as the embodiment of fulfilled prophecy. John was by no means a timeserving politician who pandered to the crowd; rather, he was committed to the revealed truth of God’s kingdom, regardless of whether it was accepted by a majority of the people or not. John was even willing to stand, alone and unwavering, for the truth that he was sure was sent from God.

This week, we also learn that truth brings about division and determines who will receive it with open minds and humble hearts.

#### Part II: Commentary

**The Baptist’s Humility of Soul**

John the Baptist did not immediately, or completely, disappear from the scene of history after he fulfilled his crucial and prophetic role as the Messiah’s forerunner. John was truly committed to Christ’s mission; nothing except imprisonment and martyrdom could stop him from his work. His example of radical commitment to the cause of Christ should inspire us to remain tenacious in His cause, as well.

Unfailingly loyal, John knew his proper limit and role in relation to Christ. This kind of realism and humility allows for no jealousy or competition. John declared plainly, “ ‘ “I am not the Christ” ’ ” (John 3:28, NKJV). John pointed people away from himself and led them to focus instead on Jesus, the “Bridegroom,” the one whom he served as his friend and in whom he rejoiced.

Christ is the One who came from heaven, from the bosom of the Father, and His living words give eternal life. John, the beloved disciple, cites his former teacher, the lowly-in-heart John the Baptist, who says of himself in relation to Christ, “ ‘He must increase, but I must decrease’ ” (John 3:30, NKJV). The increasing of Christ and the decreasing of self are listed in the right order.

We cannot truly be humble unless Jesus increases in our lives; He alone can crucify self and remove it from the throne of the heart. Of course, Satan tries to present John 3:30 in the reverse order: he encourages people to decrease first (works) and then watch Jesus’ grace increase in their lives. But such an attempt is a spiritual impossibility, for only the dominant power of Christ in the heart can subdue self. In other words, we must not put the proverbial cart before the horse.

A story is told of a young boy who enjoyed singing songs about Jesus, whom he loved with all his heart. He often prayed for Jesus to come and live in his heart, and he literally believed that Jesus would do so. But he was curious as to how the great Jesus could fit into his small body. His dad could not adequately answer his question, but this little boy answered his own question. He told his dad that Jesus was so much bigger than he was that when he invited Him into his heart, He must always stick out of him!

What a touching picture of our Christian witness! What bubbles out of us when we interact with people? Is it self or the Savior? The Savior longs to sit on the throne of our hearts, filling our lives with His saving grace like a sweet-smelling savor.

**A New Understanding of the Messiah (John 1:32–36)**

John the Baptist emphasized the agenda of Christ’s spiritual kingdom: spiritual regeneration and personal surrender of an individual’s heart to God. John’s message was at odds with the expectations that the Jews harbored about the Messiah. Ignoring the biblical prophecies about a suf­fering Savior, the Jews bypassed His humiliation. Instead, they focused their ambitions on the hope for a mighty king who would liberate them from the bondage of Rome and expand His rule over the world.

When we carefully consider John 1:32–36, we notice that John endeavored again to remind the Jews of the spiritual nature of the Messiah. Consider John’s emphasis on the ministry of the Holy Spirit as He descended and rested upon Jesus and empowered Him to baptize those who believed. Moreover, notice how John highlights Jesus’ eternal identity as the divine Son of God, as well as His being the sacrifice, the “Lamb of God,” who would liberate His people from the bondage of sin.

John’s announcement about the Messiah reinforces the need for us to focus on what is eternal in nature, as opposed to earthly things. Everything we see around us, even the greatest of possessions, will pass away. But spiritual realities will endure forever. We need to follow in the footsteps of our father Abraham, who “waited for the city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God” (Heb. 11:10, NKJV). The reference to “foundations” was intended to remind Abraham, the father of the faithful, of the solidness and permanence of God’s promise in contrast to the temporal nature of his nomadic life.

**Acceptance and Rejection (John 6:1–71)**

After the miracle of the feeding of the 5,000, the multitude was suddenly aroused to crown Jesus king over all Israel. But Jesus harbored no political aspirations, nor was He swayed, as many politicians are, by popularity or the majority public opinion. Rather, Jesus ardently desired to establish His kingdom in the hearts of the people. The people tried to coerce Jesus into fulfilling their political plans, but He withdrew to be by Himself with His Father.

The people wanted to accept Jesus on their terms, ignoring the fact that they needed to accept Him on His terms. In the end, they decided to reject Him because they chose to focus on what was immediate and temporary. They did not look beyond these things to the bigger picture of the eternal and unseen realities of God’s kingdom. It is the inclination of the un­converted human heart to reject what does not fit its long-held preconceived notions. As we can see, the people were so obsessed with the physical bread that they were blinded to the offer of Jesus’ spiritual bread, which they desperately needed for salvation.

Jesus offered Himself to the people as that spiritual bread came down from heaven, so that they might never hunger again. In the same way, Jesus offered Himself as the Living Water to the Samaritan woman, who drank from Him the Water of Life, never to thirst again. For many other disciples beyond the Twelve, Jesus’ loving attempts to reveal the light of divine truth seemed only to harden their hearts in rejection of that truth. Instead of trying to understand and believe, the people excused themselves by stating, “ ‘This is a hard saying; who can understand it?’ ” (John 6:60, NKJV). Thus, regrettably, they “walked with Him no more” (John 6:66, NKJV).

At that point, Jesus looked at His remaining twelve disciples and asked, “ ‘Do you also want to go away?’ ” (John 6:67, NKJV). Then Peter, who served as the group’s spokesman, said something profound, which was inspired by the Spirit: “ ‘Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life’ ” (John 6:68, NKJV). These are words of inspiration that we all must keep in mind! There is no place, and no one, to go to for salvation except Jesus.

**The Witness of the Father (John 5:36–38)**

John the Baptist testified several times to the reality of the true Messiah sent from heaven. But surely the Father’s testimony about His Son, along with the witness of God the Holy Spirit, are the most powerful. At Jesus’ baptism, all three members of the Godhead were fully engaged. The Father’s voice testified that Jesus was His “ ‘beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased’ ” (Matt. 3:17, NKJV). On that occasion, the heavens were opened “to Him [Jesus], and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting upon Him” (Matt. 3:16, NKJV).

There was nothing else that Jesus could have said or done to convince His opponents beyond what was said or done on the day of His baptism. Moreover, John the Baptist testified of the veracity of heaven’s witness. So why did Christ’s opponents not believe the audible and visual witness of the Father and the Spirit on His behalf? Why did they not believe in the divine mighty works and words?

The powerful testimony of Lazarus’s resurrection from the dead should have convinced the Jewish leaders that Jesus was the true Messiah. But, in their spiritual darkness, they could not see the light of God’s truth shining all around. They refused to believe, no matter what evidence was plainly set before their eyes. In fact, the Pharisees, always at odds with the Sadducees, found a convenient opportunity to unite forces to condemn Jesus to death. Shortly after, Jesus prayed, “Father, glorify thy name” (John 12:28). The Father’s voice testified on behalf of Christ’s sacrifice on the cross that He had “ ‘both glorified it and will glorify it again’ ” (John 12:28, NKJV).

**The Witness of the Crowd (John 7:37–53)**

Many of the common people, including some of the Gentiles, came to believe in Jesus, having witnessed His mighty works. Jesus became very popular among the masses who were not as learned and thus not as closed-minded or prejudiced as their leaders. The murderous jealousy of the leaders reached a boiling point. They adamantly refused to believe in any evidence for Jesus, human or divine, come what may.

#### Part III: Life Application

Think about and answer the following questions:

1.	Regarding the humility of John the Baptist: There is so much self-centeredness and self-aggrandizement in the world today. But John was cognizant of who he was and what his mission was all about. He never tried in the slightest way to upstage Jesus or usurp His position; He did not mind being eclipsed in order that the true Light might brightly outshine him. What should be our proper attitude when it comes to human position or recognition? What does the notion that Jesus must increase and we must decrease say about Jesus and about us?

2.	Regarding the crucial subject of salvation in Christ: How does studying and wholeheartedly believing the powerful testimonies of God, of John the Baptist, and of others that Jesus is indeed the unique and incomparable Son of God help us to be drawn to Him, knowing that we are helpless and hopeless without Him?

3.	Regarding feeding on Jesus, the Bread of Life: How do you apply this pertinent inspired counsel to your daily life: “What food is to the body, Christ must be to the soul. Food cannot benefit us unless we eat it, unless it becomes a part of our being. . . . We must feed upon Him, receive Him into the heart, so that His life becomes our life.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 389.

4.	How do we acquire a moral backbone to stand for the right when it comes to popularity, majority opinion, or peer pressure? We know from the Bible that the majority is not always right. How does having the support of God and His truth make us a majority, even when we are in the minority?
