#### Part I: Overview

Study Focus: John 8:23

The evidence continues to mount concerning the divinity of Jesus. In his Gospel, John provides more convincing proof that Jesus is indeed who He claims to be—the Son of God, sent to rescue sinful humanity. In this Gospel, Jesus reasons with people in order to get them to look at His pristine character, His divine credentials, His mighty words, and His miraculous works.

As the incarnate Son of God, Jesus came to save this sinful world. He was one with the Father. Thus, Jesus said and did everything in accordance with the will of the Father. Christ was God’s greatest gift to humanity, and without such a gift, the world would be doomed. Yet, sadly and ironically, in spite of this truth, most of the world, which He created, did not believe in Him. Neither did His own people. John made this point abundantly clear. What a tragedy that God’s creatures, made in His image, rejected His indispensable Gift! Jesus “was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the world did not know Him. He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him” (John 1:10, 11, NKJV).

This week, we shall study some pertinent prophecies in the Scriptures that clearly reveal Jesus as the promised Messiah. Moreover, we will examine the specific details of how these prophecies were precisely fulfilled. For example, we will look at the fulfillment of the prophecy about how Jesus would enter Jerusalem, riding on a donkey (Ps. 118:26, Zech. 9:9). We also will look at the prophecy of the disciple who would betray Him (Ps. 41:9). Moreover, we will study the dynamic of why some leaders decided to reject Him while, surprisingly, others chose to believe in Him. Ultimately, in this process, we will consider the question: What does it mean to have the mindset of reasoning “from beneath,” according to John 8:23, versus a mindset of reasoning from above?

#### Part II: Commentary

**Old Testament Prophecies of Jesus**

The precise fulfillment of the many Messianic prophecies in the life and ministry of Jesus is simply awe-inspiring. These Old Testament prophecies were fulfilled with incredible accuracy. The most hardened skeptic and doubter is rendered defenseless against the avalanche of evidence. Though Jesus knew how hardened the Jewish leaders were, He never gave up on them. He always tried from every possible angle to convict their stubborn hearts. Though many were not responsive to Him, He continued to reach out to them so that, at the very least, they might know that there was a declarer of truth among them.

It is easy to be critical of the Jewish leaders and to be baffled by their lack of faith in their own Scriptures regarding the Messiah. But how would we have reacted if we were in the same position, if our utmost priority was to anticipate a Jewish (not divine) military conqueror in the tradition of Moses or David, one who could vanquish the Roman presence from Israel and break its yoke? Remember, even Christ’s disciples, those closest to Him, were slow to believe in His spiritual kingdom. Indeed, it was only after His resurrection that they truly believed. (See John 2:22.)

The problem with the religious leaders is that they knew the letter of the law but not its spirit. Indeed, they knew the Written Word but, alas, not the Living Word. Jesus testified to this failing when He said to them: “ ‘You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which testify of Me. But you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life’ ” (John 5:39, 40, NKJV). Ancient Jewish traditions taught that merely knowing the Scriptures guaranteed eternal life. This notion is evident in what Hillel, a renowned rabbi of the first century b.c., reportedly taught about this subject. Hillel is quoted as saying, “One who has acquired unto himself words of Torah, has acquired for himself the life of the world to come.”—Mishnah Aboth 2. 7, Soncino ed. of the Talmud, p. 17 (quoted in the SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 955).

Thus, the Jewish leaders were so obsessed with the words of Scripture that they neglected the heart of it—Jesus. The leaders substituted a superficial intellectual assent for the regeneration of the heart. Searching the Scriptures, as they did, was not a bad thing in and of itself, but it prevented them from seeing the deeper meaning of Christ’s mission and His offer of salvation.

The apostle Paul resonates with Christ’s words to the leaders when he writes that the “letter kills, but the Spirit gives life” (2 Cor. 3:6, NKJV). Focusing on the letter, devoid of the Spirit, leads to legalism and hypocrisy, which in turn results in comparing oneself to others instead of looking unto Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our faith.

The Jewish leaders claimed to believe in Moses, their most revered prophet, but they did not believe in the divine “Prophet” whom Moses prophesied was to come. Upon his departure, Moses promised the people, “ ‘The Lord your God will raise up for you a Prophet like me from your midst, from your brethren. Him you shall hear’ ” (Deut. 18:15, NKJV). Jesus reminded the Jewish leaders that Moses, whom they greatly admired, believed in Him and His future mission. Yet, now that this promise was being fulfilled before their eyes, they refused to believe. Jesus remonstrated with them: “ ‘For if you believed Moses, you would believe Me; for he wrote about Me’ ” (John 5:46, NKJV).

Fulfilled Messianic prophecies, which very often deal with human relationship dynamics, reveal much regarding Christ’s character. Let us consider two such examples. The first prophecy is found in Psalm 41:9, which predicts, “Even my own familiar friend in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, has lifted up his heel against me” (NKJV). Jesus applied the prophecy to Himself, as the one betrayed by a friend: “ ‘I do not speak concerning all of you. I know whom I have chosen; but that the Scripture may be fulfilled, ‘He who eats bread with Me has lifted up his heel against Me’ ” (John 13:18, NKJV).

In Mideast culture to this day, sharing food with someone is a special act of bonding that brings emotional and spiritual closeness to a relationship. Thus, duplicity by one toward another with whom food has been shared is a sign of betrayal. Jesus spent three and a half years not only eating with Judas but forgiving and encouraging him. During this time, Jesus sought to protect the reputation of Judas. Though Jesus had ample justification for doing so, He did not seek to expose Judas as a thief publicly. In return, Judas sold Jesus for 30 shekels, the price of a common slave. Then, on the night of the Savior’s arrest, Judas approached Jesus and kissed Him. Despite this treacherous betrayal, Jesus actually called Judas “friend.” Jesus said to him, “ ‘Friend, why have you come?’ ” (Matt. 26:50, NKJV).

For the second example of fulfilled prophecy that reveals Christ’s charac­ter, let us consider Zechariah 13:6. This verse talks about the wounds that Jesus received by means of His crucifixion. His side was pierced, and His hands were wounded. Zechariah foretold in this verse that Jesus would receive these wounds in the house of His friends. By implication, Jesus refers to His arch betrayer as His friend and to His cruel crucifiers among the Jewish leaders as His friends! Thus, the pure and innocent shed blood of Christ does not cry out in vengeance against those who spilled it. His wounded hands are not clenched in wrath; they are stretched forth to embrace all in love and reconciliation.

**From Beneath (John 8:23)**

John spends most of chapter 8 referring to Jesus as the sublime and divine Son of God, sent by His heavenly Father to help hopeless earthlings. Everything Jesus talked about was heavenly. He was the heavenly light that illuminated a world darkened by sin. The Father bore witness that He sent His Son from on high to be a true Witness of the truth. All the gifts that Heaven bestowed on us in the person of Jesus were contrasted with earthly things when the Savior said to the Jewish leaders, “ ‘You are from beneath; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world’ ” (John 8:23, NKJV).

“From beneath” implies that the leaders were so earthly-minded that being heavenly-minded was an impossibility. They were so glued to their traditions and blinded by their own narrow and self-centered philosophies that they chose this world and death, refusing heaven and certain life in Jesus. Paul aptly described such a class of professed followers as having a “form of godliness” devoid of any godly substance. They substitute outward piety for inward purity. (See 2 Tim. 3:5.)

Unexpectedly, John tells us that “many believed in Him” (John 8:30, NKJV). This assertion contains a great lesson for us when things seem hopeless and many are faithless: light prevails even in a time of darkness. Jesus preached the truth regardless of people’s acceptance or rejection. We must do the same, in spite of discouraging circumstances.

The religious leaders’ disregard for the truth led them deliberately to close their eyes and blind their own hearts against it so that they would not see the light sent from heaven. Had they opened their minds to Jesus, they would have believed. But such an act would have threatened their preconceived notions. May we always be willing to open our hearts and minds to the truth, because as Jesus said, “ ‘You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free’ ” (John 8:32, NKJV).

#### Part III: Life Application

Think about and answer the following questions:

1.	Consider how Jesus’ life was a perfect reflection of His Father. Jesus often talked about His Father and the intimate relationship they had together. At one point, Philip asked his Master to reveal the Father to the disciples. Jesus responded, “ ‘Have I been with you so long, and yet you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father’ ” (John 14:9, NKJV). In everyday life, how does seeing the Father in Jesus impact your existence, and what dif­ference does that understanding make?

2.	Shouldn’t it be concerning, even alarming, when we, like the religious leaders, are confronted with the plain truth from the Bible and then deliberately turn away from it? What part does pride play in our violating our conscience and turning us away from the truth? How can the Holy Spirit help us to put our prideful opinions aside and become more teachable?

3.	Whatever usurps the priority of Jesus in our lives becomes, in reality, an idol. Scary as the thought is, if we aren’t careful, even our work for Him could potentially take His place in our lives. Bible study also could possibly take the place of Jesus. Contemplate this sobering statement and react to it: “As activity increases and men become successful in doing any work for God, there is danger of trusting to human plans and methods. . . . Like the disciples, we are in danger of losing sight of our dependence on God, and seeking to make a savior of our activity.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 362.

4.	What does it mean to have a “from beneath” mentality? Do we sometimes drift into that way of thinking? If so, how?

5.	Many believed in Jesus (John 8:30), despite all the unbelief around them. How does this fact encourage us not to give up on people who seem to be resistant to the light of God’s truth?
