#### ADDITIONAL THOUGHT
 
“Here is what we must do. We are not to wait for something special to happen. Instead, we are to make the most of our opportunities. We must do what must be done so that souls may be saved. We must not waste our time trying to figure out things that God has kept secret from us. Instead, we must yield ourselves to the control of the Holy Spirit. We must do the work we have been given by God to do. We must give the bread of life to souls who are dying of hunger for the truth.”—Adapted from Ellen G. White, Selected Messages, book 1, page 186.

“Every individual wants the power to influence others. But God’s people must see that putting themselves fully under God’s control is the only way they will be safe from the desire to control others. God’s grace [forgiveness and mercy] changes the heart. It will lead to oneness that has not yet been seen. All who yield [give in] to Christ will be in harmony with one another. The Holy Spirit will create oneness in faith.”—Adapted from Ellen G. White, Selected Messages, book 3, pages 20, 21.

#### DISCUSSION QUESTIONS 

`What does Ellen G. White mean when she says, “Every individual wants the power to influence others”? Why is that desire so natural to all of us? And what can we do to fight this desire in our own lives? (Read also <a class="verse" verse="Philippians 2:3, 4">Philippians 2:3, 4</a>.)` 

`Some argue that what will really make us one is service, not our beliefs. In fact, they argue that church teachings seem to divide people. So, they think church teachings should not be given an important place in the work we do for God. But why must we have oneness in our teachings and beliefs? Why can there be no oneness in the work we do for God unless we have oneness in what we believe? Why is shared faith a powerful tool for working together as one for God?`

`At the same time, how much room is there for differences in belief? Few people are going to understand truth in the exact same way. How can we be one in our faith as a church? At the same time, how can we allow for small differences in what we believe? How do people in your local church deal with differences in understanding but still remain one in faith?`

`How can the Bible be a tool to help the church be one in faith? What thoughts or feelings do we need to have in our study of the Word so that we can be one in work and faith?`
