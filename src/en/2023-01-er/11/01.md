### Read for this week’s lesson
2 Chronicles 20:1– 22; 1 Chronicles 21:1–14; 2 Peter 3:3–12; Matthew 6:24.

> <p>Memory verse</p>
> “ ‘Bring me thank offerings, because I am your God. Carry out the promises you made to me, because I am the Most High [above everyone and everything] God. Call out to me when trouble comes. I will save you. And you will honor me’ ” (Psalm 50:14, 15, NIrV).

SOMETIMES WE FEEL as if everything in life is out of control. There is too much war, killing, crime, sex, sin, too many natural disasters, sicknesses, money problems, and bad governments. The list goes on! When bad things happen, families often think about taking care of their own needs first. Many people want to feel safe. Of course, we can understand that, right?

Our need to feel safe and take care of our needs can take a lot of our daily energy. We have loans and bills to pay, children to take care of, and property to manage. We need clothes, food, and shelter. Jesus talks about the need for these things in His Sermon on the Mountainside. Jesus says, “ ‘Don’t worry, because your Father in heaven knows that you need all these things. What you should want most is God’s kingdom and doing what he wants you to do. Then he will give you all these other things you need’ ” (Matthew 6:32, 33, ERV).

When times are tough, we need to trust in God more than ever. This week, we will look at some Bible rules that we can follow during hard times.
