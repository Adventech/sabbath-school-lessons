### Two Best Friends

_by Chifundo Kanjo_

Bahadu Ibrahim lives in the middle of Malawi. Both of his parents were non-Christian. His parents expected him to accept their religion. Bahadu didn’t know any other religion, so he accepted their religion as his own.

Then one of Bahadu’s older brothers married a Seventhday Adventist woman and joined the Adventist Church. When Bahadu was a teenager, his parents sent him to live with his brother and his brother’s wife in Lilongwe. Lilongwe is the capital city of Malawi. When Sabbath came, Bahadu’s brother wanted Bahadu to go to church with him. Bahadu really didn’t want to go. But he felt he had no choice. So, for two years, Bahadu went to church every Sabbath.

After the two years, Bahadu went home to his parents in Kaluluma village. There, Bahadu made friends with another teenager. The teenager was an Adventist. Bahadu liked his new friend very much. His friend was kind and caring. Everyone in the village liked the young man and said many wonderful things about him.

The young man invited Bahadu to go to church with him on Sabbath. Bahadu really did not care about going to church. But he enjoyed spending time with his new best friend, even in church. So, Bahadu went to church with his friend. As time passed, their friendship grew. Bahadu’s friend explained that the seventh-day Sabbath was the true Sabbath of God. The friend gave Bahadu books to read. Little by litte, Bahadu started to understand new Bible truth about God and the Sabbath. But Bahadu wasn’t convinced that Saturday was the true Sabbath. Bahadu decided to compare the Bible with the holy book from his family’s religion. But Bahadu didn’t tell his parents what he was doing. He studied the Bible in secret. As Bahadu read the Bible, he discovered that Jesus is Lord. Bahadu decided to give his heart to Jesus and get baptized. Bahadu no longer went to church because he felt forced to go. He went to spend special time with Jesus, his new best Friend.

After Bahadu got baptized, his parents refused to have anything to do with him. They stopped paying his school bill. So, Bahadu couldn’t finish school with the rest of his class. Both of Bahadu’s parents died before accepting his decision to be a Christian. Bahadu has strong faith. He says, “The best decision I ever made was to become a Christian.” Today, he is a student at Malawi Adventist University, where he studies to become a pastor.

This quarter’s offering will support six learning centers and schools in Africa.
