### A Working for God in Malawi

A woman saw a Seventh-day Adventist young man walking on the road on the island of Chizumulu in Lake Malawi. The woman saw he wore a Pathfinder uniform.

“Where are you coming from?” the woman asked.

The student’s name was Levison Kawonga. Levison told the woman that he had finished a Pathfinder meeting at an Adventist church. His words touched the woman’s heart.

“I used to be an Adventist,” she said sadly. “I married an Adventist man, but we divorced.” The woman told Levison that she started to go to bars and wild parties after that. Then she moved to Chizumulu and married a local high-school teacher.

The next Sabbath, the woman showed up at the Adventist church. She enjoyed the worship there, the sermon, and the fellowship with the church members. Then the woman asked Levison for Bible studies. Levison was so happy! He came to the island to share God’s love. Before Levison came to the island, he joined a club of Adventist students at Mzuzu University. The club helped Adventist students to grow stronger in their faith. Club members met two times each week to pray with each other. The club grew bigger. Later it became the Mzuzu Seventh-day Adventist Church. The students decided to go to other places in Malawi to share Jesus’ love with people. One of those places included the island of Chizumulu.

Levison visited the woman and her husband in their home. After he studied the Bible with them, Levison gave them a few books. One of those books was The Great Controversy, by Ellen G. White. When Levison arrived for the second Bible study, he saw that the husband was reading The Great Controversy. The husband asked Levison, “Why do some people worship on Saturday and some people on Sunday?” At the end of the Bible study, the husband promised to go with his wife to church the next Sabbath.

Weeks and months passed. Then the man and his wife gave their hearts to Jesus and got baptized. Today, the man and his wife are members of the Chizumulu Seventh-day Adventist Church. They love to share Jesus with other people.

Levison believes that God can use young people to reach anyone. Levison says, “We need to take the Good News about Jesus to all people on the earth.” The Mzuzu Seventh-day Adventist Church started as a club of students. Those students were amazed what God would do when Levison went to Chizumulu. Glory to God! Part of this quarter’s 13th Sabbath Offering will support Adventist education in Africa. Thank you for your offering in second quarter 2021 that helped Adventist education in Malawi to grow.
