### Twin Surprises in Finland

_by Andrew Mcchesney_

When Simo Vehkavuori was a young man, he sold Bible books in Finland. Simo got a big surprise at a house he visited. Simo rang the doorbell. A woman opened the door. When she saw Simo outside, the woman said, “I want to order the set of ten Bible story books from you!” Simo was very surprised. Before Simo said anything, the woman was ready to buy. Simo didn’t even get a chance to tell the woman he was selling books or that he had Arthur Maxwell’s set of ten Bible story books for children.

“You must be surprised that I’m buying all these books from you,” the woman said. “Last night, God gave me a dream. In the dream, He showed me your face. God said, ‘This man will come to your house. Buy from him the set of ten Bible story books.’ So, that’s why I was ready to buy them right away.”

Another time, Simo stopped by a local business. Simo offered the business owner a copy of Ellen White’s The Great Controversy. The man said, “My wife and I know about this book. But we don’t understand anything about it. Our daughter is the manager for a religious school. She will be here tomorrow. Can you come back?”

Simo agreed to come back. Simo told his twin brother about what the local business owner said. Simo’s twin brother was selling books with Simo in town. Simo asked his brother, “Please pray that everything will go well tomorrow during my meeting with the business owner and his family.”

The next day, Simo went to the business. The owner introduced Simo to his daughter. The daughter became angry when she learned that Simo was Seventh-day Adventist. The woman said mean and nasty things about his church.

When the woman finished, Simo asked her for permission to speak. “Dear lady,” Simo said, “we serve a wonderful God in the Adventist Church! I want to follow and serve this God with my whole heart. We can trust Him wherever He leads us.”

The woman looked surprised. “Young man, I can see that God means so much to you.” Then the woman turned and said to her mother, “Mother, can you give me some money? I want to buy all the books that this young man has.”

Simo sold her the books. Then he prayed with the woman and her parents. When Simo went back to his room, he found his twin brother on his knees. Simo’s brother was praying for him and his meeting with the business owner and his daughter. Simo was so excited to share his good news. He told his brother about God’s miracle.

Simo is now retired. He said, “It was a powerful experience for me to see God work a miracle in that family.”
