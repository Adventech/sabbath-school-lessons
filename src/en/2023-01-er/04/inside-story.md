### A Young Artist’s Gift

_By Sachiko Obara_

My husband and I live in Japan with our 14-year-old son, Eichiro. Eichiro loves to draw. He wanted to buy an electric drawing pad or computer tablet to help him make his art. So, Eichiro decided to save money during his summer vacation to buy the tablet.

Eichiro carefully researched computer tablets online. He looked for the best tablet for his needs. Soon Eichiro found a tablet he liked. He went to the store with his father to see the tablet and try using it. Then Eichiro looked for ways to earn money to buy the tablet. I helped my son by paying him money to do extra chores around the house.

After some time, Eichiro saved up 55,000 Japanese yen. Yen is Japanese money. 55,000 yen is the same as 500.00 in U.S. money. Then Eichiro ordered his tablet online.

Eichiro was so excited. “My tablet will arrive soon!” he told me. Every three hours, he went to the online store to check when his package was coming.

A few days later, the package arrived. Eichiro opened the package carefully. First, he read the information booklet that came with the tablet. Eichiro learned all about the tablet and how to use it. Then he started to paint. For the next three days, Eichiro behaved the same as a professional artist. He painted all day in his “art studio.” (His art studio really was his bedroom!) Then he came out of his room and made a surprising announcement. “I’m thinking about giving my tablet away,” he said. Eichiro said he saw a show on TV. The show was made by the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Japan. The show was about how some Japanese artists were making a comic book from Ellen G. White’s book The Great Controversy. Eichiro saw a young Adventist artist on the TV show who was working on the comic book. The artist had an old tablet.

Eichiro said, “I want the artist to use my new tablet. I think my new tablet will help her to get more work done. I will ask God if this is what He wants me to do.”

I contacted the person in charge of the comic book. This person put me in touch with the young artist that my son saw on TV. Yes, the artist did need a new tablet, the same tablet that Eichiro had. But when the artist learned that Eichiro worked so hard for it, she refused to accept the tablet. I told the artist that Eichiro prayed about his decision. He believed God wanted him to give his tablet to the her. “Then I will accept the tablet with a grateful heart,” the artist said.

I believe the Holy Spirit touched my son’s heart in a powerful way. Let’s all obey God as my son did when God asks us to help Him do His work on earth.
