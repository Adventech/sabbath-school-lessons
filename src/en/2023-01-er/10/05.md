**Read the verses below. These verses teach us some important rules about managing money. What are these rules?**

`1 Timothy 6:17`

`2 Corinthians 4:18`

`Proverbs 30:8`

`Ecclesiastes 5:10`

Money can make people do crazy things. Satan tries to turn money into a curse. But it doesn’t need to be that way. With God’s help, we can say no to the devil’s plan by being good managers. We can start to plan now for what will happen to our money when we die.

Some of us may say, “I can give all my money away later in life.” So, while we live, we help no one with our money. We spend all our money on ourselves. We don’t support God’s work. As Christians, we need to do better than that. God expects us to do better than that because we are managers.

“I saw that many people don’t support God’s work while they live. . . . They wait until they are about to die. Jesus asks His followers to do more. We must not be selfish while we live. If you hold on to your property until you die, who will get your property? God’s cause, or death? Death. Losses happen all the time. Banks fail. People lose property. Many people plan to do something. But they wait until it is too late. Satan works hard to keep people from giving their money to God.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church, volume 5, page 154, adapted.
