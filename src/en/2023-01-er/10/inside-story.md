### Meet People Where They Are

_by Andrew Mcchesney_

Simo Vehkavuori is a retired pastor who lives in Finland. Simo walked to a lake near his house. The beach was crowded with people. Many people swam in the lake, too. Simo felt the Lord lead him to walk past the lake. Simo came to another smaller lake. There, he saw four young people sitting on the grass near the water. Simo said, “Hi, would you like to hear a story about the Finnish civil war a hundred years ago?”

The young people nodded. “Yes, please tell us!” When Simo finished the story, he said, “May I ask how you feel about religion?” “We believe in God,” they said.

When Simo was done telling the story, he told the young people that he had several cards for online Bible studies. The young people were interested in the Bible studies. Simo found that he had four cards in his pocket. “Wow!” a young woman in the group said. “The Lord knew there were four of us here. That’s why you have four cards with you!”

At another lake, Simo saw a young woman sitting in the sun. Simo said to her, “Hi, would you like to hear a story about the Finnish civil war?”

The young woman said yes. After the story, Simo asked her how she felt about religion. Then he told her how he became a Christian. The young woman was very interested in Simo’s story. When Simo finished, he said, “I have a book named Steps to Christ at home. Will you wait here while I go home and get it for you? It only will take me 20 minutes.”

The young woman agreed to wait. When Simo came back, he brought her the book and a Bible-study card. The young woman accepted both gifts. She told Simo she was grateful for them.

Another time, Simo met a married couple with their teenage son. Simo asked them, “Would you like to hear a story about the Finnish civil war?” After the story, Simo asked the parents how they felt about religion. The parents told Simo that they had a big problem at home. Their son was using drugs.

Simo said, “We need to pray together. The woman started to cry. After they prayed, Simo said, “I want to share a book with you. But the book is at my home.”

The man said, “We can drive there in our car.” After they drove to Simo’s house, Simo gave the man and his wife a copy of Steps to Christ and a Bible-study card.

Simo believes God blesses his efforts to meet people in Finland. No one refuses to hear his story about how he became a Christian. Simo says, “We must follow Paul’s example. We should go meet people. We shouldn’t wait for people to come to us.”
