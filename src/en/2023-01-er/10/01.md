### Read for this week’s lesson
Luke 12:16–21; Psalm 49:17; Proverbs 27:23–27; 1 Timothy 6:17; Psalm 24:1.

> <p>Memory verse</p>
> “I heard a voice from the sky. It [the voice] said, ‘Write this: From now on, happy are those [people] who die believing in the Lord.’ ‘Yes,’ says the Spirit. ‘They will have rest from their troubles. The good things they have done will go with them [continue to be a blessing after they die]’ ” (Revelation 14:13, WE).

As we get older, we start to think more about our retirement. Retirement is a big decision. Retirement is also a big change in life. Many people have a hard time retiring. Many older people also worry about the future. They worry about dying too soon, before they’ve taken care of their families. Older people worry about not having enough money when they retire. They worry about losing all their money, too. They also worry about who will take care of them if they get sick.

Ellen G. White explains where all these fears come from: “All these fears come from Satan. . . . Old people must follow God’s plan for their lives. Then their final days will be their best years and their happiest years. . . . Old people should stop worrying. They should try to be as happy as they can and get ready for heaven.”—Testimonies for the Church, volume 1, page 424, adapted. This week, we will study God’s advice for our final years. How should we get ready for retirement? What should we not do? What important rules should we follow?
