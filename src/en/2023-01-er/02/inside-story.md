### Making a Deal with God

_by Andrew Mcchesney_

Dmitry Bagal was a student from the old Soviet Union. He came to Germany to study about God at Friedensau Adventist University. A few months later, after he started school, Dmitry ran out of money. He decided to try to get a job at the school or in a nearby home for retired people. But whatever job he chose, Dmitry knew he wouldn’t earn enough money to pay for school. He couldn’t get a loan from the German government the same way German students could. So, Dmitry decided to ask the school for money. The money the school gave Dmitry was smaller than the loan from the German government. But Dmitry didn’t have to pay back the money to the school.

Dmitry prayed about his problem. He decided to make a deal with God. He prayed, “Lord, please bless me with a special gift of money. If You do, I promise to give You a second tithe to support Your work.” Tithe is 10% of all the money we get.

Dmitry asked the school for the money. He was so happy when the school gave the money to him. So, Dmitry started to pay a second tithe of everything he earned. Each time his classes started, he got the money again and again from the school. Paying a second tithe was a lot of money. But Dmitry somehow always had enough money to pay his school bill and buy the other things he needed. He also started to save some money for an emergency.

Then Dmitry’s five-year-old laptop computer started to break downwhilehewasworkingonhishomework.TwotimesDmitry had to buy parts to fix his computer.Then the laptop’s lid stopped closing shut. Dmitry needed a new laptop if he wanted to finish his assignment. He was happy that he saved some money for an emergency.

While Dmitry prayed about his emergency, he remembered a friend. His friend also was from the old Soviet Union. His friend and family went to the South American jungle to work for God. The high heat and rain had destroyed his friend’s laptop. His friend needed a new laptop badly. Dmitry needed one, too. But he didn’t have enough money for two laptops. In the end, Dmitry bought a new laptop and mailed it to his friend.

Soon after Dmitry mailed the package, he saw an ad on his laptop screen for the exact parts he needed to fix his laptop. Dmitry ordered the parts. He fixed his laptop, and it worked the same as a new one. His laptop continues to work today, eight years later. Dmitry knows that God blesses people who put His work first. Dmitry said, “The Lord continues to keep my old laptop running. The Bible says, ‘Anyone who is kind to poor people lends to the Lord. God will reward them for what they have done’ ” (Proverbs 19:17, NIrV).
