### Read for this week’s lesson
1 John 5:13; Deuteronomy 28:1–14; Proverbs 3:1–10; Malachi 3:7– 11; Matthew 6:25–33.

> <p>Memory verse</p>
> “ ‘Now, if you will be careful to obey the Lord your God and follow all his commands that I tell you today, the Lord your God will put you high [make you a big success] above all the nations on earth. If you will obey the Lord your God, all these blessings will come to you and be yours’ ” (Deuteronomy 28:1, 2, ERV).

God made special agreements with us. God’s agreements with us also are named promises. Most of God’s promises have two parts. So, both God and humans have a part to do. An example of a two-part promise is “If you do this, then I, God, will do that.” Or, “I, God, will do this, if you will do that.”

Another type of promise has only one part. An example of a one-part promise is: “I, God, will do this, even if you don’t do anything.” Only a few of God’s promises with humans have one part. Whatever we do or don’t do, we can trust God to give us sunshine or rain. After the Flood, God made humans and every animal on the earth a promise. God promised not to drown the whole earth in water again (Genesis 9:9–16). God also promised that until the end of the earth, we will have a time to plant crops (Genesis 8:22).

This week, we will study some very important two-part promises between God and His people. Let’s pray that we will keep our part in these agreements.
