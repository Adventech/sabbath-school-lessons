### Miracle Of An Adventist Frontier School

_By Chifundo Kanjo_

John Phiri went to two schools when he was young. The two schools were very different from each other.

As a youth, John left his home in Malawi to go to Zanzibar. Zanzibar is an island in the Indian Ocean. John studied his family’s religion there for three years. John learned how to start houses of worship in places where there weren’t any in Africa.

John finished school. Then he went back to Malawi. John was put in charge of two houses of worship. He also was told to spy on local Christians in his area carefully. The leaders of John’s religion told him to read a King James Bible to help him understand Christians and their religion better.

During the next few years, John joined three different Christian churches. John became a top leader in one of these churches. John continued to collect information about Christians for the leaders of his religion in Zanzibar. At the same time, John served as the leader at worship centers for his religion in two towns in Malawi.

John’s heart was touched as he read the Bible. Soon, John understood the teachings of the Bible better than he understood the teachings of his own religion. The more John learned, the more he wanted to know about Jesus.

John decided to go to a Seventh-day Adventist school in the frontier of Malawi. This school was very different from the school in Zanzibar. John was interested in the school’s Pathfinder club. He joined the club.

John fell in love with Jesus during a week of prayer at the Adventist school. John gave his heart to Jesus and got baptized. John stopped sending information to Zanzibar. John’s father was angry when he learned that John became a Christian. John’s father blamed his wife for John’s decision to become a Christian. So, John’s father divorced his wife.

Years passed. John wanted to serve God. So, John used everything he learned in school to serve God. In the past, John started houses of worship for his old religion in Zanzibar. Now, John decided to do the same thing for Jesus. John started churches in his country where there were none. John did this work for ten years. At this time, many people from John’s family gave their hearts to Jesus.

Later, John studied to be a pastor. John went to Malawi Adventist University. Today, John serves as an Adventist pastor. John said the Adventist frontier school changed his life. “Frontier schools are very important,” he said. “They help people get to know Jesus and accept Him as their personal Savior.”
