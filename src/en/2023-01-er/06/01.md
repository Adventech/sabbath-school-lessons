> <p>Memory verse</p>
> “ ‘It is worth nothing for you to have the whole world [everything this life offers us] if you yourself are lost’ ” (Mark 8:36, ERV).

JESUS gives us the best advice about what we should do with our money and our treasures. Jesus says: “ ‘Don’t store [collect] treasures for yourselves here on earth. Moths and rust will destroy treasures here on earth. And thieves can break into your house and steal the things you have. So store your treasure in heaven. The treasures in heaven cannot be destroyed by moths or rust. And thieves cannot break in and steal that treasure’ ” (Matthew 6:19, 20, ICB).

Jesus finishes by saying, “ ‘Your heart will be where your treasure is’ ” (Matthew 6:21, ERV). So, Jesus really is saying, “Show Me what you spend your money on. That will show Me where your heart is.”

Do you want to build up God’s kingdom? If yes, then support God’s work with your money. Put your time, money, prayer, and energy into God’s work. If you do, you soon will become more interested in His work.Your heart will be filled with more love for God’s work, too. This week, we will study Bible verses and ideas that teach us how to save our treasures in heaven. Then God will give us an everlasting reward at the Second Coming.
