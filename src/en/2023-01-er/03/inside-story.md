### Sabbath Test in Malawi

_by Sheron Ndhlovu_

A college in Malawi announced that its students must take all their final exams on the seventh-day Sabbath. This announcement filled the Seventh-day Adventist students with worry and fear.

One Seventh-day Adventist student at the college was named Lucy. Lucy and other Adventist students got special gifts of money to study at the college. They wanted to become teachers. The college was owned by the government of Malawi. There was not enough food in Malawi that year, in 2006. The government had very little money to buy food. So, the government leaders asked the schools to make their school week shorter. To save money, the college moved the final exams from Monday and Tuesday to Saturday. Lucy was upset about this change. The future of the Adventist students didn’t look good.

The Adventists decided to ask the college to change the day of the exams. Several students went to meet with the school manager. But the manager refused to change the day of the exams. Things got worse when the other students started to make fun of Lucy and her Adventist classmates for their Sabbath beliefs.

Lucy watched as many Adventist classmates agreed to take the exams on the Sabbath. In the end, only Lucy and three other students stood firm. Lucy and her friends decided to honor the Lord and His Sabbath. They prayed and again went to the school manager’s office to ask him to change the exam day.

At the office, Lucy felt shamed and insulted. The school manager told her that she should feel honored that the government gave her money to go to school. The school manager told her to think of her children who just lost their father. Now Lucy was taking care of the children by herself. The school manager told Lucy to take the exams on Sabbath so she could get a job to help her kids. But the insults didn’t cause Lucy to give up her faith. Lucy believed God would help her.

Lucy and her three classmates kept on praying. They asked their pastor to pray, too. The pastor talked with the president of the Adventist Church in Malawi. The president asked the government leaders to help Lucy, her friends, and all Adventist students in Malawi. That’s because this was a problem for Adventist students all across Malawi.

All of a sudden, the college changed its decision. They changed all the exams back to their old schedule. God answered the prayers of four loyal students in a powerful way. Lucy Nyirenda passed her exams and became a teacher. She says, “God promises that He won’t leave or fail the ones who trust Him.”
