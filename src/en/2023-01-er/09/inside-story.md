Not Afraid To Talk About Jesus

_by Andrew Mcchesney_

Simo Vehkavuori is a retired pastor. On an Easter Sunday, he stood in a train packed with people. Simo just finished preaching about Jesus. Now he traveled back home by train to Helsinki, Finland’s capital. A 24-year-old university student also got on the crowded train and looked around for a seat. Simo said to the young woman, “There aren’t any empty seats in this part of the train. If you stay here, you will have to stand the same as I am. But why don’t you walk through the train cars and see if you can find an empty seat?

The young woman came back to Simo a little while later. She said, “I found two free seats. One for me and one for you. Come with me!” Simo followed the young woman to the empty seats. He sat down across from her. Then Simo said to her, “Excuse me. But may I ask you how you feel about religion?”

“I’m not very spiritual right now,” she said. Simo asked, “Do you want to know how I became a Christian?” She said yes. Simo told her his story. As the train approached Helsinki, Simo

asked, “Would you mind if I remembered you in my prayers?” The student burst into tears. “Yes, that would be wonderful. Please do that!” Before Simo left, he said something to the student that he often tells new friends: “Jesus paid the price for our sins on the cross. This same Jesus has promised to come back and will take us to a home in heaven. Then we will live forever with Him. So, dear friend, let’s stay on the road to heaven until we get there.”

On another trip, Simo was surprised when a young woman said hello to him. The young woman shook Simo’s hand as he got on the train. Simo introduced himself. He said, “Hello, I’m a retired Seventh-day Adventist pastor.”

“That’s interesting,” the woman said. “I’ve never heard of Adventists. I want to hear all about your church on this trip. Here are two empty seats. Let’s sit together.”

Simo spoke about the Seventh-day Adventist Church the whole trip, which was 300 miles. As Simo and the young woman left the train, a man walked up to them. The man grabbed Simo’s hand in both of his hands. The man said to Simo, “Thank you for being brave enough to share God so that the rest of us on the train also could enjoy what you had to say.”

At 84 years old, Simo looks for ways to share Jesus with people on every train ride. “The older I get, the braver I get!” he said. “I’m not afraid to share Jesus!”
