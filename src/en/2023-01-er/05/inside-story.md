### From School Bully To Church Leader

_By Sheron Ndhlovu_

Edmond grew up in Mzuzu, Malawi. Edmond was a bad child. He refused to obey his parents, teachers, or any other adult. At school, Edmond hit other boys and his teachers. Both children and adults were afraid of Edmond.

Edmond had mean ideas. He thought it would be fun to bully the kids in the local Pathfinder club. Edmond and his friends went to Chasefu Seventh-day Adventist Church. There, the boys made fun of the Pathfinders when they marched and sang. Edmond enjoyed seeing the Pathfinders get upset. Edmond and his friends came back week after week to bully them.

As the weeks passed, Edmond started to become interested in the things the Pathfinders did. Edmond wanted to know more about what the Pathfinder children were doing and what they believed. When the church held some Bible meetings at Mzuzu Stadium, Edmond went. But he didn’t tell his friends because he was afraid they would laugh at him. Edmond also didn’t tell his parents. Edmond’s parents belonged to a different Christian church. Edmond was afraid his parents would punish him if they knew he went to the Adventist meetings.

At the meetings, Edmond fell in love with God. Edmond learned that God made the skies and the earth. God also made the seventh-day Sabbath. Edmond was afraid that none of the Adventists would like him. He had been very mean and nasty to the Pathfinder children and adults. So, Edmond expected everyone to reject him. In the end, Edmond did a very brave thing. He couldn’t change the past. But he gave his heart to Jesus anyway and got baptized.

Edmond’s parents found out about his baptism four months later. Right away, they ordered him to get out of their home. They told Edmond he was no longer their son. Edmond stayed in the homes of church members. These church members taught him more about the Bible. Edmond learned a lot about Bible truth. Edmond also worked so that he could afford to stay in school. Three years passed. Edmond’s parents saw that their son had changed. Edmond served God with faith. So, Edmond’s parents asked him to come back home.

Today, Edmond Tchiri is married to a Seventh-day Adventist wife. Edmond and his wife have two sons. Edmond also serves as a church leader at Chasefu Seventh-day Adventist Church, the same place where he used to bully the Pathfinders! Edmond says that God changed him from a school bully to a church leader. Edmond adds, “Don’t look down on children or give up on them, even the ones who behave badly.”

This quarter’s 13th Sabbath offering will support six more schools or learning centers in Africa.
