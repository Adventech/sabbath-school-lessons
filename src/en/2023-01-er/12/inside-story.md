### A Precious Treasure

_By John Kaganzi_

13-year-old Precious was upset with her father. Precious cried as Father led her through the gates of a Seventh-day Adventist school in Uganda. Precious didn’t want to study and live at the Adventist school. She wanted to study at the beautiful school that taught her family’s religion. “Beautiful buildings don’t make a school good,” her father told Precious. The beautiful school had not been doing well for the past three years. People didn’t respect this school now as much as they did in the past.

Precious said nothing more to her father. But her unhappiness showed in her face. When Father waved goodbye at the gate, Precious cried. “Why has Father put me in this ‘prison’ that is named a school?” she asked. A smiling woman came over to Precious. “Hello,” the woman said. “Let’s go to the house where the girl students live. I will show you where you will sleep.”

Precious was sad and didn’t want to go. But she followed the woman anyway. The woman carried Precious’s mattress and suitcase to the student house. That evening, Precious saw students standing in a line outside an old building. Precious wondered what was happening. Then she saw students carrying plates of food. Precious knew that the old building was the cafeteria. That evening, Precious ate a vegetarian meal for the first time in her life. Later, Precious heard a bell ring. She saw students run to the campus chapel for evening worship. Precious decided to go to the students’ house. But the doors were closed. So, Precious went back to the chapel. She stood on the porch, not sure what she should do. The smiling woman that helped her earlier came over to her. “Come inside the Lord’s house. It’s prayer time. Don’t be sad.”

The woman was so nice. Precious felt loved. She went inside the chapel. Right away, she stopped feeling sad. Students were singing in the chapel. Precious never heard singing so beautiful before. She also liked the worship time that happened after the singing. Worship only was 30 minutes long. Precious thought the worship was very interesting. She thought, “At least I will enjoy this part of school.”

Father didn’t come back to see Precious until the end of the quarter. Father was afraid that Precious would refuse to stay at school if he came any sooner. Father was surprised when Precious announced that she wanted to go back to the school after her school break was over. Precious told Father that she didn’t want to miss her nice teachers. The teachers started every class with prayer and a Bible verse. When Precious came back to school, the school held a week of prayer. Precious gave her life to Jesus.
