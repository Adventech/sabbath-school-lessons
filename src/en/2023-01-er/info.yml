  title: "Managing for the Master Until He Comes"
  description: "God wants to save sinners. He also wants to be their Friend. Sometimes we have a hard time understanding these two wonderful Bible truths. The Bible tells us, “The Father has loved us so much! God shows how much he loved us: We are called [named] children of God. And we really are his children. But the people in the world [who are not part of God’s church] don’t understand that we are God’s children, because they have not known him” (1 John 3:1, ERV)."
