The Cat And The Bible Bookseller

_by Andrew Mcchesney_

When Simo was a young man, he sold Bible books in Finland. Simo was selling books in the middle of winter near Turku. Turku is one of Finland’s oldest cities. Simo stopped at a nice house near the city. Two sisters lived in the house. They did not have husbands. Simo showed the sisters his books.

Right away, the sisters agreed to buy every book Simo had. After this surprising announcement, the sisters left Simo standing in the living room. Simo waited for them to come back.

Finally, one of the sisters came back downstairs. She held a big cat in her arms. The woman said to Simo, “Sir, aren’t you going to do anything to help our cat?”

Simo was more surprised. “What should I do?” he asked.

“Aren’t you the pet doctor that we just talked to on the phone?” she asked.

“No,” said Simo, “I’m the Bible bookseller.

For years after that, the sisters told their friends about how they thought Simo was the animal doctor. The sisters thought they had to buy all the “doctor’s” books first before he would heal their cat! The sisters laughed so hard when they told their friends that story. The sisters kept their promise to Simo. They bought all his books, even after they learned he wasn’t a vet!

Another time, Simo went to the forest to eat lunch and pray. It was Friday afternoon. Simo prayed, “Before this week ends, Jesus, please give me a chance to tell somebody that You are so wonderful.”

Simo finished his lunch. The he went to a farmhouse and knocked on the door. A woman opened the door.

Simo held out a copy of Ellen G. White’s The Great Controversy to the woman.

The woman said, “I’m not interested in the book at all. But I want to know what Jesus means to you.”

Simo told the woman about his love for Jesus. Then the woman invited Simo to come inside and pray with her.

At that moment, the woman’s adult daughter came to the door. The woman said to her daughter, “Join us.”

The three of them prayed together. Simo got up to leave. The woman followed him to the door. She said, “I want to buy that book you showed me.”

Later, a pastor started some Bible meetings in the area. Simo introduced the pastor to the woman and her family. The pastor went to the farmhouse and gave the family Bible studies. The family joined the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Today, the woman’s granddaughter is a church leader in the city of Helsinki. Helsinki is the capital city of Finland.
