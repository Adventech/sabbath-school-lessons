#### Praying for a Baby
_By MARJORIE CHISONGA_

My son was born a year after I got married. Then nothing. No more children.

People started to notice. “Why aren’t you conceiving?” one person asked. “Maybe you should go to the medical doctor for help,” another said.

Some people suggested that I visit the witch doctor.

My husband and I wanted more children. He taught at Rusangu Secondary School, a Seventh-day Adventist boarding academy in Monze, Zambia. I was studying to become an elementary school teacher.

What could I say to those inquiring about the size of my family? “That’s the way it is,” I repeated again and again. “God will provide.” I wasn’t sad or annoyed by people’s pity. But as time wore on, I realized that some of my more superstitious friends thought I was being  punished for some unknown reason.

Then my husband’s sister died, and we adopted her 3-year-old daugh- ter. Now we had two children in our home. My superstitious friends rejoiced, saying the girl’s presence would wake up my hormones and allow me to have another baby.

Still nothing happened.

But the biblical story of Hannah in 1 Samuel 1 gave me hope. Hannah was a prayerful woman who never gave up. She persisted until God granted her prayer, and she gave birth to Samuel.

My husband and I kept praying. We prayed for 13 long years. Then one day I noticed something was different. I was pregnant! My husband and I immediately knelt to pray with thanksgiving.

We named our second child Cheelela, which means “worthwhile” in the Tonga language. He was well worth the wait. In no time, I gave birth to a third son, Chakondela, which means “let it be so.”

My two younger sons are now 17 and 14—and they love Jesus.

God has blessed my family abundantly. We just had to be patient. When you ask God to give you something good in faith, He will give you more than you could possibly desire.
