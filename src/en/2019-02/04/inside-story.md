#### Division President Baptizes Father
 
_By ANDREW MCCHESNEY, Adventist Mission_

Samuel Saw, president of the Seventh-day Adventist Church’s Southern Asia-Pacific Division, grew up without a relationship with his father.

The two never spent time together in their home country of Myanmar. They didn’t talk about things.

“He never hugged me,” Saw said. “I was a boy without a father.”

Saw, who was raised by his grandparents, went on to study in an Adventist school and graduate as a pastor from the Myanmar Union Adventist Seminary in Myaungmya, a city of 280,000 people located about 140 miles (225 kilo- meters) west of Myanmar’s capital, Yangon.

Church work was challenging in the southeast Asian country where just four percent of the population is Christian. Buddhists account for about 90 percent of the population, and Muslims comprise 4 percent.

As a pastor, Saw told many people, “Reach out to your non-Christian family and other relatives.” But he never reached out to his own father.

Saw got married, had two children, and served as a pastor and church administrator in Thailand, Singapore, and the Philippines.

While serving as executive secretary of the Southern Asia-Pacific Division, Saw attended a Week of Prayer that prompted him to think hard about his father. He shared his childhood story with the speaker, and the two men prayed together.

“You’ve got to reach out to your own father,” the speaker said.

Saw prayed to God to give him strength. He felt pain when he thought about his father, and he lacked a desire to connect with him. He kept praying— and the unexpected happened.

“I was privileged to baptize my own father at the age of 76,” Saw said. Saw still remembers what his father said afterward.

“Son,” the elderly man said, “I want to be a Christian who goes to church with a songbook and the Bible in my hand. Please buy a songbook and a Bible for me, so I can carry them to church.”

Saw choked up with emotion as he remembered his father emerging from the water of the baptismal tank and wrapping his arms around him.

“It was the first time that he hugged me in my whole life,” he said.
