#### Missionary’s Joy Journal

_By Andrew McChesney, Adventist Mission_

The year couldn’t have gone worse for Elisa Albertsen, a native of Palmer, Alaska, who quit a promising career as a hairdresser to volunteer at a mission school in the Marshall Islands.

Just three months into the school year, she had to be airlifted back to the United States after dislocating a kneecap while playing soccer at Ebeye Seventh-day Adventist School.

After four months in the United States, Albertsen was still recovering and realized that she would have to break her promise to her students to return before the end of the school year.

Then she and her longtime boyfriend broke up.

Disappointed and discouraged, Albertsen decided to take a 40-day fast from secular music, books, and movies and to immerse herself in the Bible and the writings of Adventist Church cofounder Ellen G. White. It was then that she started a joy journal.

“I wanted to count 1,000 gifts God gave me,” she said. The daily entries in the joy journal began with simple things. Albertsen wrote that she was grateful for clean water and the sunlight shining through the window. As she continued to write, she remembered the words of the apostle Paul, “Rejoice always” (1 Thessalonians 5:16, NKJV).

When she discovered ants swarming over the food in her dog’s bowl, she thought, This is so frustrating. I hate ants! Then she remembered the joy journal and, peering closely at the busy ants, marveled at their perseverance, teamwork, and ability to carry a load many times their size.

In her joy journal, she wrote, “I thank God for ants. Through God, we can accomplish things that are much bigger than us.”

Albertsen also found joy in other negative circumstances. When someone criticized her, she wrote, “Thank You for that critical word because it puts me on track to improve and draw closer to You.”

She thanked God for her dislocated kneecap, realizing He strengthened her mentally and physically through the injury.

Albertsen is now 21 and back at Ebeye as a second-grade teacher. She pulled out the joy journal after catching a flu going around the island.

“When I lost my voice, I said, ‘Praise God because now I can hear my children better,’ ” she said.
