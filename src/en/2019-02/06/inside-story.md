#### A Strange Light

_By Andrew Mcchesney, Adventist Mission_

Ruth Jereh sang heartily as she walked home from the bar in her hometown, Mazabuka, in southern Zambia.

It was Friday evening, and she had spent the entire day drinking beer.

Suddenly a blinding light appeared in front of her. The light hung in space, and Jereh stared at it, not knowing from where it had come. Her song stuck in her throat, and she instantly became sober. Then the light vanished.

Trembling, Jereh made her way home. She didn’t say anything to her hus- band or 14 children that night, but she broke her silence in the morning.

“Honey,” she told her husband. “Yesterday, on my way back home, I saw a big light that scared me.”

“Stop drinking beer,” her husband replied. “This could be God talking to you.”

Later that day, a Dorcas worker visited Jereh’s home and invited her to an Adventist church meeting. With the previous night’s experience fresh in her mind, Jereh went with her husband.

Jereh had been raised in an Adventist home but left the church after marry- ing her husband, who belonged to another denomination. He played the saxo- phone in bars, and for years she sold homemade food as he played. Afterward, they would drink for hours.

It got to the point that Jereh would drink from morning until evening and forget her young children.

Drinking was part of Jereh’s life, and she struggled to quit after seeing the bright light. For two weeks, she woke up at night, frightened and weeping. “God, the life that I am living has caused me to neglect my children,” she said. “Help me to stop drinking beer.”

Then one day she lost all desire for alcohol.

Townspeople were stunned to see her sober. They knew how she had been before, and they asked which roots she had taken under the witch doctor’s direction to give up drinking.

“How did you stop drinking beer?” asked one. “Give us the root that helped you to stop,” said another.

Jereh replied to everyone, “The medicine that I used was prayer.”

Jereh also has used the power of prayer to win over her family for Christ. She was baptized, and, through her influence, 10 family members also have been baptized, including her husband.

“I always thank God in my prayers for allowing my family and me to start worshiping,” said Jereh, 62. “Worshiping God is very important in life.”
