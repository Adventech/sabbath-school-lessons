  title: "Adventist Heritage: Our Identity, Mission, and Message"
  description: "In recent years, people have become interested in tracing their biological roots. Multibillion dollar companies have sprung up to meet the growing demand, offering quick and easy do-it-yourself DNA tests that allow people to discover what percentage of their DNA is Chinese, Northern European, Southern African, or Native American, to name just a few examples. Perhaps we’ve become so interested in our history because knowing our past has an impact on our present and future. It offers us a sense of cultural identity. Similarly, understanding our church history gives us a sense of purpose and mission both in the present moving forward. The past, present, and future cannot be separated."
