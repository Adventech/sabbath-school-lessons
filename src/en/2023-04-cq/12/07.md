Share insights from this week’s memory verse and Bible study as well as any discoveries, observations, and questions with your Sabbath School class (or Bible study group). Consider these discussion questions with the rest of the group.

`How can we preserve a sense of urgency in sharing this message without having a fixed date to rally around like the Millerites did in 1844?`

`What is the implication of the angel messenger speaking with a “loud voice”? Why does this message need to be shared loudly?`

`How will the three angels’ messages ever go to the whole world if at least three billion people still haven’t heard Christ’s name?`

`How is the Sabbath included in the three angels’ messages?`

`What changes would we see in our daily lives if we followed the three angels’ messages like the people described in Rev. 14:12?`

`How do the three angels’ messages prepare us for Jesus’ second coming?`

`Are the three angels’ messages outdated, overused, or worn-out? Why or why not?`

`What other ways are the gospel message and doctrinal truth connected? What would some of the consequences of separating the two be?`

`How can we find the right tone in sharing some of the more offensive parts of our message such as coming out of Babylon?`

`What biblical promises can you claim when you’re patiently waiting for something?`
