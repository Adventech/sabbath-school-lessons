`What does Hazen Foss’ rejection of his calling and subsequent rejection by God tell us about how we should respond when God calls us to do something?`

`How would the church react today if a seventeen-year-old claimed to have the gift of prophecy?`

`How can we test a prophet to know if the prophet is true or false?`

`What can we learn from Ellen White’s hesitancy to accept the call to share her prophetic gift in public?`

`What is God’s purpose in sending the gift of prophecy to His people in the last days?`

`God didn’t send prophets when His people didn’t follow His laws. What does this say about how He operates and how He treats us?`

`What does Deuteronomy 18:22 and Jeremiah 28:9 teach us about a prophet’s predictions?`

`How can we avoid only accepting a prophet’s counsel when it agrees with our current lifestyle and beliefs?`

`In what ways could the writings of a modern, non-canonical prophet be misused in church?`
