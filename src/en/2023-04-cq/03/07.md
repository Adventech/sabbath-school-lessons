### inQuire

Share insights from this week’s memory verse and Bible study as well as any discoveries, observations, and questions with your Sabbath School class (or Bible study group). Consider these discussion questions with the rest of the group.

`The teenagers in Paris Hill committed to keeping the Sabbath before their parents. What does this tell us about our own duty to truth? What challenges do you face in following your convictions in your families?`

`Thomas Preble was instrumental in early Sabbath history, yet only a few years later he stopped keeping the Sabbath. Who else has been used by God but might not be saved in the Bible or throughout history, and how can we avoid this same outcome?`

`Ellen and James White only kept the Sabbath after reading a tract on it by Joseph Bates. What does this tell us about how God lead His movement into truth?`

`What can we learn from Frederick Wheeler’s interaction with Rachel Oaks after he preached and she confronted him?`

`How does seeing the Sabbath connected to the sanctuary and the judgment change our comprehension of it and how we live it out?`

`How does Isaiah 58 make the Sabbath more about others than about ourselves?`

`How do we avoid our own pleasures but still call the Sabbath a delight?`

`Is it ever okay to do the right thing for the wrong reason?`

`In what ways can your local church or group make the Sabbath more about joyful service than what it currently might be?`

`In what ways are we offering something to God through our Sabbath worship that He is not asking for?`

`How do we balance our own need for spiritual nourishment on the Sabbath with our responsibility to serve and provide for others?`

`The first Angels message in Revelation 14:7 contains a challenge to end time believers to worship God on the Sabbath. Why is honoring God through the Sabbath particularly important for end time believers?`
