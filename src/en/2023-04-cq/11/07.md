Share insights from this week’s memory verse and Bible study as well as any discoveries, observations, and questions with your Sabbath School class (or Bible study group). Consider these discussion questions with the rest of the group.

`What specific people groups are represented by the six descriptions Jesus listed in Matthew 25:35, 36?`

`What criteria does Jesus use to separate the nations when He judges?`

`What do we learn about Jesus’ character from Him identifying Himself so closely with the lowest people of society?`

`How was Jesus being countercultural by paying special attention to the poor?`

`Early Adventists were involved in the abolition and temperance movements. What lessons can we learn about how we should respond to social problems today?`

`What are some things that cause us to be distant from the very people we are called to minster to?`

`Edson White’s conversion led him to minister in one of the most challenging areas of his time. How should we respond when we see a very challenging mission field?`

`What stops our churches from a radical commitment to serving people in our communities?`

`How can we navigate around the challenges that might prevent us from ministering to the needy?`

`What motives should we have when we serve? What should we do when we realize we’re serving for the wrong reasons?`
