`God waited patiently for our movement to adopt various truths and practices. What does this teach us about how to deal with others who are on a similar journey?`

`Do you think so few people tithe regularly because there’s no direct or immediate punishment for robbing God? Or does it just come down to selfishness and laziness?`

`How is the local and global mission of the church impacted when God’s people are unfaithful in tithes and offerings?`

`The SDA Church collects tithe locally but distributes it both locally and globally. What are the advantages or disadvantages of this system over a model where all the money stays in the local church where it’s collected?`

`Why does God sometimes have conditions for His blessings?`

`Why does God still expect us to return a faithful tithe and offering, regardless of how it is used by those entrusted with it?`

`Can we still receive blessings through giving tithe even if we don’t honor God in every other area of our lives? Why or why not?`

`How can we overcome the mindset that all our money is ours and we can choose what we do with it?`

`What other ways are we impacted when we rob God of tithes and offerings?`

`What other ways is God affected when we rob Him of tithes and offerings?
