Share insights from this week’s memory verse and Bible study as well as any discoveries, observations, and questions with your Sabbath School class (or Bible study group). Consider these discussion questions with the rest of the group.

`In what ways has the health message benefited the Adventist Church? In what ways have various health movements detracted from the work of the church?`

`What lessons can we learn from how long it took the Adventist movement to adopt these new practices? How should their example inform the way we treat others who are learning about them for the first time?`

`Why should Christians pursue good physical health?`

`What might be some wrong motives for healthy living?`

`How are health benefits weakened when done for the wrong reasons?`

`How do we avoid developing a superiority complex when we have good health?`

`How do we tactfully, humbly, and lovingly decline something that we have decided not to partake of?`

`What are the implications of our bodies being a “temple of the Holy Spirit” (1 Cor. 6:19, 20)?`

`Why should the health message be closely connected with the three angels’ messages?`
