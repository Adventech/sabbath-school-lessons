Share insights from this week’s memory verse and Bible study as well as any discoveries, observations, and questions with your Sabbath School class (or Bible study group). Consider these discussion questions with the rest of the group.

`Why can love never be forced?`

`What kind of risks does love require?`

`Why do you think Satan is so successful at convincing us that following God is restrictive and following him is freedom? Why does this lie deceive so many?`

`In what ways could our understanding of God’s character be impacted if we don’t understand the great controversy theme?`

`Why does Satan direct his accusations not only against God but also against God’s children?`

`How can a better understanding of the great controversy theme make us better able to handle the daily trials of life?`

`How does the fact that Ellen White faced such difficulties when she received the vision and wrote The Great Controversy add to the importance of the message?`

`How does the cross demonstrate the true characters of God and of Satan at the same time?`

`How can we gain victory over Satan?`
