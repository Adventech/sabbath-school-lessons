### inQuire

Share insights from this week’s memory verse and Bible study as well as any discoveries, observations, and questions with your Sabbath School class (or Bible study group). Consider these discussion questions with the rest of the group.

`Why do you think God allowed the early Advent believers to make a mistake in their interpretations? What was the purpose in this?`

`For about thirteen years after he reached his conclusions, William Miller did very little with his groundbreaking understanding of the Bible. Why such hesitancy, and in what ways do we interact with God’s Word and share it with others in a similar fashion?`

`The truth of the Second Coming was new and given with a sense of urgency. How can we keep the freshness and urgency alive for us today, even though for many of us it’s something we have known for a long time?`

`God used a farmer to preach thousands of sermons about the Second Coming. What does this tell us about who is qualified to preach and share for Him today?`

`How can one be considered wise in the context of Matthew 25 and yet be sleeping? What does this experience look like?`

`The foolish virgins had apparently gotten used to borrowing oil, which brought them trouble when the bridegroom came. What could this borrowing look like in our lives today and how can we avoid it?`

`We live in a culture that seeks to be rewarded for doing very little, something the foolish virgins asked for as well. What other Bible stories can help us avoid this pitfall?`

`In what ways can we cooperate with the Holy Spirit so that we can be considered wise?`

`What should this parable teach us about how to respond to delay and waiting? `

`What other stories or passages reveal a similar dichotomy between the wise and foolish in the church? What are these varied and repeated descriptions trying to warn us of?`
