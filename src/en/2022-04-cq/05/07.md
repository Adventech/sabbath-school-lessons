`What evidence do we have in Philippians that Paul wrote this epistle during his first imprisonment in Rome? At what stage of his life did Paul write Philippians?`

`Was Paul’s expectation and hope to depart the body at death or to resurrect from the dead at the Second Coming?`

`What is the meaning of the word _martyr_? What did the apostle mean when he wrote that “to die is gain”? Is it possible for someone to glorify God by suffering a martyr’s death? How?`

`Why would it be beneficial for Paul to remain in the flesh rather than depart to be with Christ? Is the same true for us?`

`What did the apostle present as a better option than living in the flesh or dying? Is this our burning desire as well?`

`According to Philippians 3:10, 11, did the apostle expect to be with Jesus at death or at translation?`

`According to 1 Thessalonians 4:15–17, when did Paul expect to be with the Lord?`

`According to 2 Timothy 4:6–8, did Paul expect to get his reward at death or at the resurrection?`

`Why did the apostle Paul conclude that it would be better to remain in the flesh for the moment? Could this be true of us as well?`
