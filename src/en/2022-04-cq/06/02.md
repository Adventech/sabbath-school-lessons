The central theme of the Lazarus story is “belief and unbelief.” At each turn, the disciples, Martha, Mary, the crowd, and the religious leaders manifested either a not fully informed belief or a boldfaced unbelief that Jesus was the Messiah.

When Jesus suggested a return to Judea, the disciples objected (John 11:7, 8). Thomas said, “ ‘Let us also go, that we may die with Him’ ” (v. 16). Earlier the enemies of Jesus intended to stone Him in Judea (John 8:58, 59; 10:31, 39), but they were unable to because He was under the protective care of His Father. The disciples disbelieved that the Father could protect Jesus, however.

When Jesus said to His disciples, “Lazarus is dead, and I am glad that I was not there,” He explained why He was glad: “ ‘That you may believe’ ” (John 11:15, emphasis supplied). When Jesus told Martha that her brother would rise again (v. 23), she responded that she knew he would rise at the last day (v. 24), to which Jesus said, “ ‘I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in Me, though he may die, he shall live. And whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this?’ ” (vv. 25, 26, emphasis supplied). Like Peter (Matt. 16:16), Martha replied that she believed Jesus was the Christ, the Son of God (John 11:27), yet she did not fully understand her confession, as we can see by the way she reacted when Jesus commanded the removal of the stone (v. 39).

Mary echoed the words of Martha: “ ‘If you had been here my brother would not have died’ ” (v. 32, emphasis supplied). When Mary met Jesus, the crowd was wailing, and Jesus “groaned in the spirit, and was troubled” because of their unbelief (v. 33). Jesus then came to the tomb and wept. He did not weep for Lazarus but rather because of their future actions (see inSight). They were oblivious to who Jesus really was.

When Jesus commanded the removal of the stone, Martha objected, to which Jesus responded, “ ‘Did I not say to you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?’ ” (v. 40, emphasis supplied). Jesus then prayed to His father so that the people would realize He and His Father were a team working in unison, that “ ‘they may believe that you sent Me’ ” (v. 42, emphasis supplied).
