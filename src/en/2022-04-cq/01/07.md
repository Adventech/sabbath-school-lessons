`If God loved Adam and Eve so much, why did He place the tree of knowledge of good and evil in the garden?`

`Why does love necessitate freedom of choice?`

`Why did Satan disguise his identity instead of appearing to Eve as an angel of light?`

`Did God explain to Adam and Eve why they could not eat from one particular tree? If not, why not? How dangerous is it to delve into what God has not revealed? (cf. Deut. 29:29)`

`Why did God forbid Adam and Eve to touch the fruit? Why is it dangerous to add to God’s Word?`

`Why did Satan ask Eve the captivating question, “Has God said that you cannot eat of any tree of the garden”? How does Satan plant doubt in our minds in a similar way?`

`How did Satan’s words to Eve, “You will be like God, knowing good and evil” reflect Satan’s original temptation of the angels in heaven? (cf. White, _The Great Controversy_, 499.)`

`Which two lies does God reveal that Satan will tell again at the close of history?`

`How can we increase the volume of God’s Word in our lives?`

`After Adam and Eve sinned, what preventive measure did God take to ensure that there would never be an immortal sinner?`
