`What parallels do you find between Revelation 6:14–17 and Revelation 20:11? What event are these verses describing?`

`What evidence do we have that God functions on the basis of the principle of “innocent until proven guilty in a court of law?” If God knows all, does He really need a judgment?`

`Revelation 20:12 tells us that during the thousand years the wicked dead will stand before God in judgment. How can dead people stand before God?`

`Why does God allow the righteous to participate in the judgment of Satan and the wicked during the millennium (1 Cor. 6:1–3; Rev. 20:4–6)?`

`How does the extended meaning of the word spirit help us understand the manner in which the wicked dead stand before God?`

`What is the meaning of Revelation 20:13 when it states that “the sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them” (emphasis supplied; cf. Isa. 26:19)?`

`Why is it necessary that Satan and the wicked will witness the record of their lives after the millennium?`

`How do you explain that we are saved by grace through faith, but we are judged by works?`
