As we pointed out in Week 08, the judgment of the righteous before the millennium follows a three-step process:

* The judgment _review_ in heaven before the Second Coming (Rev. 14:6, 7; Dan. 8:14).
* The announcement of the _verdict_ and _sentence_ in heaven (Rev. 22:11).
* The _implementation_ of the verdict (the reward) when Jesus returns to earth (Rev. 22:12).

The judgment of the wicked during and after the millennium will follow the same three-step process. Before the process begins, however, Jesus will return to earth in power and glory. Revelation 6:14–17 describes the second coming of Jesus, when every mountain and island will be moved _out of its place_ (not be found) and the wicked will cry out for the mountains and rocks to fall on them to hide them from the _face_ of the One who is seated on the _throne_. Revelation 20:11 further describes the Second Coming, where there is One sitting on a throne before whose _face_ heaven and earth _find no place_. The brightness of Christ’s coming will destroy the wicked, and they will remain dead for one thousand years (2 Thess. 1:7, 8; Rev. 20:5). The three-step process will then begin:

1. _The Millennial Review_: At the Second Coming, the faithful martyrs will come to life (Rev. 20:4, 5), and they, along with the redeemed of all ages (1 Cor. 6:1–3), will participate with Jesus in the heavenly millennial judgment. During this judgment, the wicked dead will stand before God’s judgment bar, not in person but through the record of their lives (Rev. 20:12, 13). It is in this sense that the dead stand before God.
2. _The Verdict/Sentence_: After the judgment _reviews_ the lives of the wicked, the heavenly court will pronounce the _verdict_ and _sentence_. The redeemed “meted out to the wicked the portion which they must suffer, according to their works; and it was written against their names in the book of death.” (Ellen G. White, _Early Writings_ (Battle Creek, MI: Review and Herald, 1882), 291.)
3. _The Execution of the Sentence_: The third stage, the _execution_ of the sentence, will take place on earth after the millennium. The wicked will resurrect and see with their own eyes the record of their lives, and will confess the justice of their sentence (Isa. 45:23; Phil. 2:9–11). They will then be cast into the lake of fire to suffer the second death (Rev. 20:14, 15).

Here is the summary of events from the Second Coming to the destruction of the wicked (Rev. 20:11–15):

* Revelation 20:11: The Second Coming
* Revelation 20:12: The investigation and sentencing of the wicked in heaven during the thousand years. The dead will stand before God, not in person but through the record of their lives.
* Revelation 20:13: After the millennium, the sea and the grave will give up the wicked dead, and they will see with their own eyes the record of their lives and confess the justice of their sentence.
* Revelation 20:14, 15: The sentence will be executed in the lake of fire.
