The late Evangelical writer Robert Morey was quite certain that “the spirits of just men” were the departed souls of OT saints:

In this glorious picture described by the author, the earthly saints join in the worship which resounds from the myriads of angels and _disembodied spirits_ of fellow saints who have departed this life. These saints were justified through faith while on earth and are now perfected and completed in heaven. That the author is describing the blest condition of departed saints who now worship God before the throne is so clear that we must agree with the commentators that it cannot be questioned or doubted. . . . The “spirits of justified men now perfected” who are worshiping at God’s throne are obviously _conscious souls_ of believers during the _intermediate state_. (Robert A. Morey, _Death and the Afterlife_ (Minneapolis: Bethany House, 1984), 213, emphasis supplied.)

Are the “spirits of the righteous” really the “disembodied spirits” and “conscious souls” of the departed? To answer this question, let’s take the case of Moses, one of the notable heroes of Hebrews 11. After God buried Moses (Deut. 34:5, 6), there was a mighty dispute over his body between Michael the Archangel (cf. 1 Thess. 4:16; Dan. 12:1, 2; Rev. 12:7–9) and the devil (Jude 9). Do Jesus and the devil fight over corpses? Of course not! Michael had come to resurrect Moses, and Satan contested His right to do so. We know that Michael won the battle because Moses appeared to Jesus in glory on the Mount of Transfiguration fourteen centuries later. Nowhere does the transfiguration text say that the “spirit” or “soul” of Moses spoke with Jesus on the Mount.

Satan claimed that Moses was his because he had sinned when he killed the Egyptian and struck the rock twice. In the OT period, Jesus had not yet legally paid the price for the redemption of Moses. For this reason, Moses (and Elijah) talked with Jesus “of His decease which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem” (cf. Luke 9:30, 31). Moses and Elijah were sent by the Father to encourage Jesus to go forward with the redemption plan. The life record or “spirit” of Moses had not yet been “made perfect” because the blood of bulls and goats could not take away sin. When Jesus died on the cross, the life record (“spirit”) of Moses was made perfect!

Paul alluded to this in Romans 3:25, 26, where he wrote that Jesus offered Himself as a propitiation for our sins to “_demonstrate_ His righteousness, because in His forbearance, God had passed over the sins that were previously committed, to _demonstrate_ at the present time His righteousness, that He might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.”

`How does seeing behind the scenes of salvation history deepen the profundity of God’s plan and devotion of God’s heart to save humanity?`

`What is He saying to you through these texts?`

`How do you see Jesus differently or see Him again?`

`Prayer: How do you respond to seeing Jesus in this way?`
