The “spirit” (ruach) or “breath” (neshamah) is the life force that makes the body operational. These OT words sometimes appear in synonymous parallelism such as in Job 27:3, where the word breath in the first line is parallel to spirit in the second. God gives “breath” to people on the earth and “spirit” to those who walk on it (Isa. 42:5). Both “spirit” and “breath” are in the nostrils through which we breathe (Gen. 2:7; Isaiah 2:22; Job 27:3). When God takes away the “breath,” people die and return to their dust, but when He sends forth His “Spirit” they are created (Ps. 104:29, 30).

The NT word “spirit” (pneuma) parallels the cognate word (ruach) in the OT. The body without the “spirit” is dead (James 2:26); therefore when Jesus gave up His “spirit,” He died (John 19:30). When the beast from the abyss slew the two witnesses, the “spirit” (pneuma) came into their lifeless bodies and they lived (Rev. 11:7–9, 11). The uncommon NT word pnoe (Acts 17:25) means “breath.”

The OT word “soul” (nephesh) is translated “soul,” “life,” and “person.” Jacob took seventy persons to Egypt (Gen. 46:27). The life of the flesh is in the blood, because the blood takes the life-giving oxygen to the entire system (Lev. 17:11). Elijah complained that Jezebel was seeking to take his life (1 Kings 19:10). David pleaded for God to deliver his life from the sword (Ps. 22:20). At the resurrection God will redeem the life from the power of the grave (Ps. 49:15). The word soul appears four times in Ezekiel 18:4, and a proper translation would be, “Behold, all lives are Mine; the life of the father as well as the life of the son is Mine; the person who sins shall die” (literal translation). The soul is not immortal, because it can die! It goes down to the grave or pit at death, not to heaven (Ps. 30:3).

The NT word “soul” (psyche) parallels its use in the OT. As applied to the nature of man, the word simply means “life” or “person.” Paul assured the shipwrecked passengers that no one would lose their life, and all 276 persons survived (Acts 27:22, 37). Joseph took Jesus to Egypt because Herod was seeking His life (Matt. 2:19, 20). Jesus came to give His life a ransom for many (Matt. 20:28), and the Good Shepherd gives His life for His sheep (John 10:11). Paul and Barnabas risked their lives for the name of Jesus (Acts 15:26). Three thousand persons were saved on the Day of Pentecost (Acts 2:41), and Paul admonished every Christian person in Rome to be subject to the civil powers (Rom. 13:1). Souls can die because they can be saved from death (James 5:20).

We use the word in the sense of “person” when we say, “Not a soul showed up for the meeting,” “We baptized one hundred souls,” and “I pity that poor soul.” In the Bible, the word immortal never qualifies the words soul and spirit, and not once is consciousness apart from the body attributed to them.
