**Read This Week’s Passage: 1 Corinthians 15**

**Definition of Terms**

In this lesson we will study the meaning of two cognate words in different languages, the Hebrew word Sheol and the Greek word Hades. The word Hades was common in the Greek world and appears eleven times in the NT. However, the meaning of the word in the NT is not necessarily the same as in the Greek world. In other words, we cannot determine the meaning of the word Hades in the NT by how Greek philosophers such as Plato and Socrates used it. We must determine its meaning by the cognate OT Hebrew word Sheol.

Sheol has been translated in various ways: grave, hell, pit. The cognate Greek word Hades appears eleven times in the NT, and only once (in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus) does it refer to a place of burning. The translation of the word is confusing where it is rendered as grave, hell, depths, and Hades. In the lone exception, the apostle Paul wrote that the righteous would come forth from Hades at the resurrection (1 Cor. 15:55). Clearly, the translators understood that it would be absurd for the righteous to come forth from hell at the resurrection! So we are left with the question, what is the proper meaning of Hades?
