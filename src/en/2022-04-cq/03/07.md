`How does this week’s lesson bring comfort for those who die in Christ?`

`Using a concordance, give some additional examples of the words _Sheol_ and _Hades_.`

`How many times does the word _Sheol_ appear in Psalm 49:14, 15 and how is it translated? (Compare several versions.)`

`How do we explain Isaiah 14:9–11, where the wicked kings who are in _Sheol_ prepare to welcome the king of Babylon? The passage seems to indicate that the kings were conscious in _Sheol_.`

`What metaphorical language does Isaiah 38:10 use to describe confinement in _Sheol_?`

`Read Job 14:7–15. Which metaphors does this passage use to describe death and the resurrection? How do these metaphors bring comfort?`

`Make a list of the synonyms that appear in Jonah 2 that describe the place where Jonah went for three days. When Jonah cried out from the belly of _Sheol_, (Jonah 2:1), was he in a place of burning or in a watery grave?`

`Why does Revelation 6:8 say that death and _Hades_ followed the pale horse? Does the grave literally follow death?`

`How has Jesus having the keys of _Hades_ and of death change your life perspective?`
