How do we know that the word Hades is the Greek cognate of the Hebrew word Sheol? The answer is that the NT paraphrases or quotes OT verses and replaces the word Sheol with Hades. For example, Paul paraphrased Hosea 13:14 (in 1 Cor. 15:55) and replaced Sheol with Hades:

`Hosea 13:14: “O Death,      I will be your plagues! O Grave [Sheol], I will be your destruction!”`

`1 Corinthians 15:55: “O Death,      where is your sting? O Hades,      where is your victory?”`

The book of Acts provides another example. On the Day of Pentecost, Peter quoted Psalm 16:10 (in Acts 2:27, 31) and also replaced the word Sheol with Hades:

`Psalm 16:10: “For You will      not leave my soul in Sheol, nor      will You allow Your Holy One to see corruption.”`

`Acts 2:27: “For You will not      leave my soul in Hades, nor will      You allow Your Holy One to see corruption.”`

In this synonymous parallelism, the word soul in the first line is parallel to “Holy One” in the second and the word Hades in the first is parallel to the word corruption in the second. One cannot miss the point that the soul is the Holy One (not a part of the Holy One) and Sheol is a place of corruption and decay, not burning!

We find a prime example of the proper meaning of Hades in the RSV translation of Matthew 16:18: “And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the powers of death shall not prevail against it.” Hades is a place of death, not burning!

The KJV and NKJV translate the word Hades in Matthew 16:18 as “hell.” However, other versions transliterate the word as the “gates of hades” (NIV) and still others translate Hades as “death itself” (CEV), “the power of death” (NCV), and “not even death” (GNT). The Complete Jewish Bible replaces the expression “the gates of Hades” with the Hebrew, “the gates of Sheol,” which provides further evidence that in Jewish thinking, Hades is a cognate of Sheol. The idea that Sheol and death are enclosed by gates that keep the dead locked in finds its roots in the OT (Isa. 38:10; Ps. 107:18).

The immediately succeeding context of Matthew 16:18 explains why the gates of Hades and death would not prevail against the church. They will not, because they did not prevail against Jesus! (Matt. 16:21). He broke the fetters of death and the grave on the third day. The word Hades in Matthew 16:18 could easily have been translated “grave” in the KJV and NKJV. Death would not be able to keep Jesus or His church in Hades because He is the resurrection and the life!
