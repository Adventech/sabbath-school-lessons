  title: "Beyond Death"
  description: "We live in a world that is obsessed with the supernatural. Spiritualism has inundated the media and the entertainment world. One regularly hears about zombies, out-of-body and near-death experiences, ghosts, zombies, and spirits of the dead coming back as angels. Sadly, spiritualism, once taboo among Christians, has even infiltrated the Christian church. The foundational idea of spiritualism is that people can live in sin in this life and still live forever."
