#### My Wife Left Church

_By Daniel Gatan_

My wife has stopped attending the Seventh-day Adventist Church, but I have not given up hope. Here’s why.

During repressive Communist times, a woman in my home country, Romania, learned about the Adventist Church and began to attend Sabbath services regularly. This infuriated her husband.

“Where are you going at the same time every Saturday?” he asked.“Honey, I am going to the Adventist church,” she said.“I already know that,” he snapped. “You can keep going, but on one condi-tion: You cannot be baptized. I don’t want to hear that you’ve been baptized, or I’ll kill you.”

As the woman read the Bible and learned more about Jesus, she became convicted that she needed to take a public stand for Jesus through baptism.

Church members surrounded the newly baptized people after the Sabbath ceremony. They offered hugs and colorful flowers. Everyone was smiling except for one woman. She wasn’t sure how her husband would react.

That afternoon, she found her husband in the front yard when she returned home with flowers in her arms. He was sitting at a wooden table with a sharp knife sticking out of the top.

“Where are the flowers from?” he asked.“I was baptized today,” she replied.His face turned purple with rage.“Did you not believe me when I told you that I would kill you if you were baptized?” he said, pulling the knife out of the tabletop. “Get ready to die,” he said and lunged at her.

His wife fled to the back of the house, where the couple had a garden. Her husband caught up to her in the cornstalks. As he raised the knife over his head, the woman begged for one last wish: to pray. The husband agreed and watched as his wife knelt. He loomed over her as she spoke to God, holding the knife high above his head.

Suddenly, the knife blade silently slid out of the handle and fell harmlessly to the ground. The man’s face turned pale. His whole body began to tremble, and he fell to the ground beside the blade. His wife jumped to her feet and helped him up. Wordlessly, they went into the house. After some time, the husband was baptized. God changed his heart.If God can change this man’s heart, I know He also can touch my wife’s heart. I can trust in God even when all hope seems lost. dAniel GATAn, 68, is a retired construction worker from Plosca, Romania.
