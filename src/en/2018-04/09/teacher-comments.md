**Key Text**: Ephesians 5:1, 2

**The Student Will**:

- **Know**: Understand that his or her interaction with other people provides the most convincing evidence of the unity of the church.
- **Feel**: Sense the need to evaluate the nature and impact of his or her relationships with others. 
- **Do**: Ask God to work in and through his or her life to provide a witness to the truth of the gospel. 

**Learning Outline**:

1.	Know: Visible Unity
	+ Why is unity in doctrine alone insufficient to demonstrate visible unity to the world?
	+ How do our lifestyles and the ways in which we conduct relationships demonstrate our allegiance to Jesus?
	+ How does visible unity actively demonstrate the power of God?

2.	Feel: A Need to Evaluate
	+ How have the actions of another individual impacted your spiritual journey both positively and negatively? 
	+ How would you evaluate your current witness of your identity in Christ? 
	+ Why does reconciliation produce powerful emotions in both those being reconciled and those who are watching?

3.	Do: Attitudes Toward One Another
	+ What area of your life most needs the transformation of God so that you can provide a positive witness to the world?
	+ Do you need to embrace the ministry of reconciliation in your relationships?

**Summary**: Visible unity grows out of the new identity we embrace when we express faith in the saving work of Christ. The way we live and interact with others expresses the reality of the unity and provides convincing proof of both the character of God and of His transforming power.  

### STEP 1—Motivate

**Spotlight on Scripture**: Ephesians 2:13–16

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: As Christians live out their identity in the risen Christ, they provide a potent witness to the love and power of God. 

**Just for Teachers**: As you open this lesson, help students to recognize the importance of what people observe about their lives. Emphasize how our words and actions impact the way others view God and our connection to Him.   

**Opening Discussion**: Julie was adopted as a baby. She was placed in a home where she was nurtured and loved. In time, she blossomed into a kind, thoughtful Christian woman. She deeply loved her adopted family. Yet, as she grew into adulthood, she felt compelled to discover more about her birth mother and blood relatives. Julie filed a request for the contact details of her mother and was delighted when she received the information she was seeking. Before meeting her mother and her other blood relatives, Julie sent photos and the written proof of her connection to them. But these became irrelevant when the day came to meet her relatives face-to-face. They took one look at Julie and knew without a doubt that she belonged. Her new siblings were overwhelmed by the similarity between Julie and her mother. Not only did she look just like her birth mother, Julie even had the same mannerisms and tastes as her birth mother. Julie’s likeness to her birth mother was the most convincing proof that she was indeed part of the family.

In a similar manner, the New Testament writers suggest that the unity and love of Christians is the most convincing proof of their connection to Christ. How we look and act is a telltale sign of our connection with Him, more so than any other proof we can provide.

**Questions for Discussion**: What are you inclined to believe the most—actions or written proof? Why? What type of assumptions have you made about people based on their words and actions? Were all your assumptions correct?

### STEP 2—Explore

**Just for Teachers**: This section discusses kingdom living, which demonstrates the power of God. It accentuates the link between our actions and our identity in Christ. As you discuss the lesson with your class, emphasize that visible unity is not our own work but rather the work of Christ. We are called merely to live the new identity we have been given in Christ.

**Bible Commentary** 

**I. A New Identity** (Review Ephesians 2:13–16 with your class.)

As discussed earlier this quarter, the unity of the church is dependent upon the death and Resurrection of Christ that have made us a new creation, reconciled us to Christ, and provided us with a new identity in Christ. The call for believers to exhibit visible unity is, therefore, not a challenge to do the seemingly impossible. Rather, it is “a call to live out an identity that we are freely given when we submit our lives to Christ.”—Gregory A. Boyd, “Living in, and Looking Like, Christ,” in Servant God: The Cosmic Conflict Over God’s Trustworthiness, edited by Dorothee Cole (Loma Linda, Calif.: Loma Linda University Press, 2013), p. 410. It is only as we live out our identity in Christ that we provide proof of the gospel and God’s mighty power.

**II. Reconciled to God** (Review 2 Corinthians 5:17–21 with your class.)

Biblical reconciliation refers to the restoration of the relationship between previously hostile or quarreling partners. Although humans are responsible for the hostility and alienation in their relationship with God, Jesus reconciled us to God by dealing with the root cause of the enmity in the relationship. As our Substitute, He took the penalty for sin imposed by the law. God, therefore, must be seen as both the Initiator and center of reconciliation. Because God has reconciled all of humankind to Himself through Christ and given humans new life, Paul calls the Corinthians to live out their new identity as reconciled to God. They are to do this by continuing the ministry of reconciliation in the concrete situations of their everyday lives. Paul expects that the Corinthians will spread the message of reconciliation, and that the fruit of reconciliation will be manifested to those whom they encounter in their Christian journey. In the absence of outward evidence of their identity as reconciled, Paul is led to question whether the Corinthians have truly accepted the reconciliation that God has provided. He therefore calls them to “be reconciled to God” (2 Cor. 5:20, NKJV).      

**Consider This**: What is the difference between the meanings of reconciliation and justification? On what grounds is Paul justified in questioning the Corinthian commitment to God and the reconciliation that God has provided? What does embracing a mission of reconciliation look like?

**III. Living Kingdom Values** (Review Ephesians 4:25–5:2 and Romans 14:1–6 with your class.)

Living as a citizen of the kingdom of God involves more than reconciliation. It involves a new way of living that is radically different from the ways of the world around us, because it is based on different values. It involves not only an exchange of lordships, but an exchange of lifestyle. Christians are called to embrace a lifestyle that is characterized by love, grace, and mercy. Paul explains that our old lives must be laid aside in order for us to live out our new identity in the kingdom, which has been “created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness” (Eph. 4:24, ESV). This new life needs to be accompanied by a renewal of the mind in which our attitudes and priorities change. 

“The church is called to be an expression of this alternative society. . . . A place where the upside-down priorities of the Beatitudes operate. Where service is more important than status, where humility trumps hubris, where love is expressed instead of lust, and where collaboration replaces competition.”—Lowell C. Cooper, “Doing Justice, Loving Mercy—in the End Time,” in Do Justice: Our Call to Faithful Living, edited by Nathan Brown and Joanna Darby (Warburton, Victoria: Signs Publishing Company, 2014), p. 86. Living our new identity with these new priorities draws attention to the gospel. The harmony and unity that emerge when service replaces the use of others for selfish ends and humility replaces pride in one’s own accomplishments and status is so countercultural that it provides evidence of the power of God in the transformation of lives. 

**Consider This**: Why is it important that our identity as citizens in God’s kingdom be accompanied by a renewal of the mind? How well is your church doing in representing the alternative values of the kingdom of God? 

### STEP 3—Apply

**Just for Teachers**: This section asks students to reflect on whether their own lives and church accurately reflect their identity in Christ and, therefore, demonstrate proof of the power of God in their lives. 

**Application Questions:**

1.	What is the difference between the message of reconciliation and the ministry of reconciliation? 
2.	Many studies suggest that the actions and conduct of the church differ little from the society around it. Why do you think this relative lack of difference is the case? What might you conclude from such data?  
3.	In what practical ways can you demonstrate your identity as reconciled to God? To whom is God calling you to demonstrate kingdom living this week? What are you currently communicating to others by your words and actions?
4.	Which of the characteristics of life in the kingdom discussed in this lesson do you find most difficult to exhibit in your own life? How might Paul’s reference to the fact that Christ’s love compels us make a difference to your attitudes and motivation? 

### STEP 4—Create

**Just for Teachers**: The activities below provide options for class members to focus on one area of their lives that they have identified during the week as failing to provide the witness of their identity to the world around them. 

**Activities:**

1.	Pinpoint one of the characteristics of your old identity listed by Paul in Ephesians 4 that tends to creep back into your life (falsehood, stealing, unwholesome words, wrath, evil speaking, et cetera). Then identify the feature that Paul identifies should replace it. Find several texts about the feature that should replace your weakness and write them on small cards that you can carry with you. Reflect on them several times a day for the next week. At the end of the week, journal about what God has told you about your weakness and about what you need to do next.
2.	List practical examples of the type of speech that Paul calls for Christians to practice. As a starting point, you might like to consider ideas listed in 1 Thessalonians 5:11, Hebrews 3:13, and 2 Corinthians 13:11. Choose one of these examples and think about how you might apply it this week in your home, in your workplace, and in your wider circle of friends.
3.	Plan two group activities in which you seek to serve and show care to someone in your congregation and to someone in your community.
