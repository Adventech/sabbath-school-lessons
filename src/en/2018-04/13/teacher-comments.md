**Learning Outline**:

1.	Know: The Certainty of Renewal
	+ Why can we be certain that God will follow through with His promises of a harmonious future? 
	+ What does the description of the new heavens and the new earth reveal about the character of God and His ideal for His creatures?

2.	Feel: Longing for Unity
	+ How would you describe the difference between life on the earth made new and life now?
	+ When you consider your life and relationships, what needs renewal the most? 
	+ What is most attractive about the descriptions provided by John and the prophets of life in the new earth?

3.	Do: The Life of Hope
	+ In what ways does confidence in God’s promise of making all things new impact your life right now?

**Summary**: We can have certainty in the promise of a new heavens and a new earth without any trace of sin or disharmony. In the earth made new, all of creation will experience the peace and unity that God designed for His creation.

### STEP 1—Motivate

**Spotlight on Scripture**: Revelation 21:1–5

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: We are called to live in hope while we await the culmination of salvation history. At that time, our oneness in Christ and with all of creation will be fully realized.

**Just for Teachers**: As you introduce the lesson, focus on the certainty of the Second Coming and of God’s promise of a new heaven and earth without sin. Help your class realize that certainty leads to hope that should impact Christian living in a tangible way.

**Opening Discussion**: On October 22, 1844, William Miller and many thousands of other Christians waited expectantly for the return of Christ. As they waited, they joyfully sang songs and tried to imagine what it would be like to finally be with their Lord.

Miller had determined that the 2,300-day prophecy of Daniel would end that day. He assumed that this fulfillment indicated the date of Christ’s return. Longing to be with Jesus, the Millerites spread the news of Jesus’ soon coming to everyone they knew. Assured of God’s faithfulness in keeping His promises, many sold or gave away property. Such was their certainty and hope. 

Similar scenes have occurred throughout history as other biblical students have set dates for the Lord’s return. While mistaken in their notion that anyone could know the date of the Second Coming, the Millerites and those who have continued date setting demonstrate that living in hope of the fulfillment of God’s promises should make an impact on our lives right now.  

**Questions for Discussion**: What difference did the expectation of the Second Coming have on the Millerites? What difference has the certainty of Jesus’ coming made to your own life? Does it matter that you don’t know the date on which the fulfillment of God’s promises will occur? How can you best live in the hope of a new earth and restoration of relationships? 

### STEP 2—Explore

**Just for Teachers**: This section provides a focused study on the nature and extent of restoration that is promised in the Scriptures. 

**Bible Commentary**

**I. The Re-created Heaven and Earth** (Review Revelation 21:1–6 with your class.)

Creation and Redemption inextricably are linked together in the narrative of Scripture. While our focus often is drawn to the plan of Redemption, the Creation account provides the context to understand the plan of Redemption. The Creation account details the loving creation of man from dust and the Creator’s personal touch as He breathes life into the still form. The Creation account describes the ideal that God had in mind for His creation: a world that was untainted with sin, in which peace and harmony reigned and face-to-face communion with God was possible. 

When sin marred the perfect world of God’s creation, a plan was already in place for the restoration of God’s ideal. The plan involved the revelation of the divine ideal in the incarnated Son of God, who died to make reconciliation possible between God and humans. But this Incarnation was not the end of the story. The last two chapters of Revelation indicate that God will re-create the world in order to bring to fruition His original ideal of a world in which peace and harmony once again reign.

John’s description of the new heavens and new earth in Revelation 21 is carefully constructed. It contains imagery from both Isaiah (especially Isaiah 60 and 65) and Ezekiel (especially Ezekiel 40–48), as well as themes that link it to the promises contained in the letters to the seven churches. The new heavens and earth take the place of the former heavens and earth, which have “passed away” (Rev. 21:1). The world tainted by sin is no more. 

We also are told that there is no sea in the new earth. This statement might sound unusual to the casual reader; however, it is possible that the word “sea” is being used as a metaphor in this passage. In Jewish thinking the sea symbolically is linked to evil, oppression, and that which is frightening (compare with Rev. 13:1). When John claims that there is no sea in the new earth, he is suggesting that there is no longer any reason to fear evil, because all traces of it have been removed. See Ranko Stefanovic, Revelation of Jesus Christ (Berrien Springs, Mich.: Andrews University Press, 2002), pp. 575, 576. The absence of evil subsequently is reinforced by John’s claim that tears will be wiped away because their causes have been removed along with anything associated with the old way of life. That which destroyed relationships is now gone. 

Of primary importance in John’s description of the new earth is the declaration that God will dwell with His people(s) and be their God. “Our eternal home, therefore, will be characterized by community in the highest sense. It will be home not only to creatures but to the Triune God. The one who throughout eternity is the community of Persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—will grace the new community with the divine presence.”—Stanley J. Grenz, Created for Community (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker, 1998), pp. 292, 293. God had walked in the Garden of Eden with Adam and Eve and had manifested His veiled presence in the Old Testament sanctuary, but, both times, He had withdrawn His presence. With all traces of that which stands between God and man removed, humans will once again be able to commune with God face-to-face. God will reunite with His people, and unity with God brings with it a oneness with the rest of the redeemed as they once again fully reflect the image of God. 

**Consider This**: What is new about the new heavens, the new earth, and the New Jerusalem? How do these re-creations relate to the old entities? John does talk about the “springs of the water of life” (Rev. 21:6, NLT) and the “river of water of life” (Rev. 22:1, 2, NKJV) in the new earth. What is the significance of this water? 

**II. Harmony for All Creation** (Review Isaiah 11:1–10 with your class.)

It is easy to focus our attention solely on the benefits of the new earth for human beings. But to do so, is to omit the wider testimony of Scripture. Our being reunited with God is only part of the story. Isaiah indicates that harmony also will exist within the rest of creation.  

In Isaiah 11, we find that the righteousness and justice of God is at the center of His kingdom. These characteristics underlie the peace and harmony that are described in verses 6–10.

Isaiah’s description of life in the new earth has the fiercest predators lying peacefully with their prey and with humans. Isaiah connects with the reader through the imagery of a child herding domestic animals—a common practice throughout Israel’s history, one that even can be observed today among nomadic groups. In this passage, the animals most dangerous to the flock are pictured eating and lying down with the flock in the heat of the day. The peace and harmony among all creation is highlighted further by the emphasis on the ability of even the youngest child to play safely with animals that normally would pose a significant danger to an adult. 

**Consider This**: How does Isaiah 11:1–5 relate to verses 6–10? What is the relationship between wisdom, righteousness, justice, and peace? What reason is given for peace in this passage? What is meant by the knowledge of the Lord in this context?

### STEP 3—Apply

**Just for Teachers**: Knowledge about the restoration that God intends to bring about in the future should not be regarded as interesting trivia or as an excuse not to work for harmony among God’s people now. Help students to focus on the specific impact that the hope of renewal and restoration should have on their lives.

**Application Questions:**

1. What impact does the fact that God’s Word is true and trustworthy have on your life?
2. What difference does it make that God will dwell with His people face-to-face? Even though we don’t see God face-to-face now, He is still among us. How can we experience community with Him now?
3. If everything is going to be made new, why does it matter what you do with the resources around you now?
4. Compare the promises to the seven churches found in Revelation 2 and 3 with the description of the new earth in Revelation 21 and 22. What similarities do you find? What might this indicate about how hope of restoration should impact our lives now?

### STEP 4—Create

**Just for Teachers**: Revelation 21 and Isaiah 11 present a vivid picture of the harmony and community we can expect to experience in the new earth. Help students understand its extent and reality so that they will yearn for what is to come and share that hope with others. 

**Activities:**

1. Create a collage or scrapbook page in which you contrast the reality of relationships now with relationships as they are described in the new earth. 
2. Share the hope that you have for a new beginning with someone who needs to know that there is something beyond his or her current problems.
