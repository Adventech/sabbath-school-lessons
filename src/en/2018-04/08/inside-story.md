#### Punished for Others’ Sins

_By Andrew Mcchesney, Adventist Mission_

When people first met the young boy, their first question was not “What’s your name?” but “What’s wrong with your legs?”

Jack Chen crawled along the ground in his rural home in central Taiwan until he was five. Through daily physical exercises, he managed to build enough muscle to stand upright when he entered first grade. But he walked awkwardly on the balls of his feet, prompting teasing and taunts of “Freak!” from the other children. Sometimes, the boys spat on him as they passed by.

Chen was born with a leg disease that puzzled doctors. But Chen and his parents had no doubt about the cause: Someone had done something wrong in the family, and now they were being punished.

“My family worships idols, and my parents believed that we were being punished for something that they or our ancestors had done,” Chen said.

When Chen was 12, a family friend suggested that Chen, who was lagging in public school, might have a better chance studying at a nearby Seventh-day Adventist school.

Chen heard about Jesus for the first time when he enrolled in the seventh grade. He read the Bible for the first time. He decided at the age of 13 to give his heart to Jesus.

The answer to his biggest question—why he was being punished for other people’s sins—came about a year later when he read of Jesus healing a man blind from birth. He read, “And His disciples asked Him, saying, ‘Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?’ Jesus answered, ‘Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but that the works of God should be revealed in him’ ” (John 9:2, 3; NKJV).

Chen felt a heavy burden being lifted as he read those words. “I realized that this was not a punishment but a blessing,” he said. “If I didn’t have this disease, my family and I never would have had a chance to know God.”

Chen went on to graduate from Taiwan Adventist College and now serves as a pastor in the coastal town of Jiading. He walks with a slight limp in one leg but otherwise functions normally. He is married and has two young sons.
