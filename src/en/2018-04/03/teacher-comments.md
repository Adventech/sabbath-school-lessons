### STEP 1—Motivate

**Spotlight on Scripture**: John 17:20, 21

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: Followers of Jesus have been called to represent the love and character of God to the world around them through their unity with one another. 

**Just for Teachers**: Emphasize that when we call ourselves Christians, people around us begin to judge Christianity and God’s character based on what they observe about our interactions, whether or not we are aware of our impact. 

**Opening Discussion**: When I moved to the United States for postgraduate study, I found myself unwittingly an ambassador for my country of citizenship. When people listened to me talk, they assumed that my accent was representative of the accents of all New Zealanders. They assumed that my clothing style reflected the current fashion in New Zealand. In fact, all my words, actions, and even food choices were scrutinized and assumed to accurately reflect my background. In many cases, the assumptions made by those around me were correct; but in other areas, their assumptions misled them. 

Every Christian is called to be an ambassador for God. How we think and act impacts the way the world understands His character. When we act selfishly, causing disharmony, the world perceives a divided and powerless God. But when we display love and unity with one another, we display the true character of God.  

**Questions for Discussion**: When have you been an unwitting ambassador? What sort of impression did your actions leave with regard to the person, country, or sport you represented? Are you more likely to make a better impression when you have chosen to be an ambassador? Give reasons for your answer.

### STEP 2—Explore

**Just for Teachers**: This section provides a focused review of the relational aspects of the prayer of Jesus in John 17. 

**Bible Commentary**

The lengthy prayer in John 17 follows what some scholars have identified as a typical farewell address. The content of the prayer itself suggests that the prayer was intended as an encouragement for the disciples, who would soon face challenges without the physical presence of Jesus. 

**I.	The Key Relationship** (Review John 17:2, 3, 20–23 with your class.)

At the very heart of the prayer in John 17 is the relationship between the Father and the Son. It is a relationship of perfect love and unity that has existed from “before the creation of the world” (John 17:24, CJB). The Father is identified as “the only true God” (John 17:3, NKJV), the Holy Father (John 17:11), and the Righteous Father (John 17:25). These titles describe both His character and His righteous actions. Jesus is identified in the prayer as Christ (John 17:2), the Son (John 17:1), and the Sent One (John 17:3), who does what the Father asks. 

The relationship between the Father and Son provides the basis and example for what Jesus requests from His followers. The relationship between the Father and Son also features in the words that Jesus utters about eternal life. Eternal life is dependent upon knowing both the Father and the Son. But notice that it is not simply knowledge of Their existence. The clarification that one must know that the Father is “the only true God” and that the Son was sent by the Father suggests that a personal and experiential knowledge is required for eternal life. The symbolism of the names used for the Father reinforces this thought by implying that those who receive eternal life have experienced the righteous and redemptive actions of God.  

This passage characterizes both the Father and Son not only by Their divinity and oneness, but also by Their generous giving. The Father gives to the Son, and the Son, in turn, passes on much of the things that the Father has given Him. 

**Consider This**: How does the use of the titles Father and Son relate to the main messages of John 17? In what sense are the Father and Son one? What does the giving character of God mean for His church? 

**II. Glory and the Mission of Jesus** (Review John 17:1–5 with your class.)

The mission of Jesus was to reveal the name and words of God to the world (John 17:6–8) and to bring honor and glory to Him. A name in Hebrew culture was both a distinguishing mark and a definition of character. So, when Jesus stated that He had revealed the Father’s name, we should understand that He had revealed the nature and character of God. Jesus revealed these two things by displaying the loving character of God through His actions. 

Jesus begins His prayer by asking God to glorify Him. The request was not merely a selfish request. It was grounded in the unity of the Father and Son, and it contributed to Jesus’ mission to reveal the character of the Father. The nature of the oneness of the Father and Son meant that if Jesus were glorified, the Father would be automatically glorified. Jesus was thus praying that He would complete His mission so that the Father’s love would be seen, and He would receive the honor and glory that are due Him.  

**Consider This**: Review the use of the words “glory” and “glorification” elsewhere in John; then define what John means by the word “glorification.” Does it refer to what happened at Christ’s ascension or to something else? In what sense do Christ’s followers receive glory?  

**III. Jesus Prays for All of His Followers** (Review John 17:6–26 with your class.)

As Jesus’ prayer continues, the mission of the believers is also revealed as one that makes known the character of God and brings glory to Him. The prayer of Jesus for His disciples recognizes the difficult journey that lay ahead of them as they attempted to fulfill this mission. 

Jesus begins by praying for His followers’ protection by invoking the name and character of God. In effect, He asks the Father to guard and protect believers, because He is a loving, merciful God, who is faithful to His promises. God’s protection of His followers is necessary, because the disciples remain in a world that is hostile to the values and principles they espouse. They are, therefore, targets of Satan, who seeks to prevent their witness to the world. 

Jesus demonstrated that representing God in the world can be done best by demonstrating His character through our daily lives. Cognizant of the fact that His disciples had been arguing over who would be the greatest in the kingdom, Jesus prayed specifically for the oneness of the believers. Envy, pride, and greed had the potential to divide them, and, consequently, destroy the picture of God they were to demonstrate to the world. Oneness, on the other hand, would demonstrate not only the nature and character of God, but also His transforming power. It is significant that Christ did not pray only for unity between believers. He also prayed for their unity with Himself and His Father. Jesus recognized that unity between one another is dependent upon unity with God. It is as we are united with Him that we develop a oneness in purpose with Him that, in turn, transforms our relationships. 

Transformation is also in view when Jesus requests that the disciples be sanctified by the truth. As they interact with the truth as it is in Jesus, the followers of Christ will experience the transformation of their lives. This transformation is essential if the followers of Christ are to be witnesses of the truth.	

**Consider This**: Why do you think Jesus prays that His followers be with Him and see His glory? What does Jesus ask God to protect, and why? What transformations occur when we are connected to Jesus? How can Christians remain connected to Jesus?  

### STEP 3—Apply

**Just for Teachers**: The questions below can help class members to evaluate their own roles and motivations in representing God’s character. 

**Thought and Application Questions:**

1.	Why is it important that we know God personally and not simply know about Him?
2.	What aspects of God’s name and character motivate your witness to the world?
3.	Which of the petitions of Jesus on behalf of His disciples is most meaningful in the twenty–first century church? 
4.	How would you evaluate your current witness to the character and nature of God? How can we improve our witness? 
5.	What type of unity is Jesus wishing for His followers? Hint: Consider the type of unity He has with His Father. What does this unity look like in practice?

### STEP 4—Create

**Just for Teachers**: The activities provided below allow personal or group reflection on the connection between our actions and our witness.

**Activities:**

1.	Compare the Lord’s Prayer in Matthew 6 with the prayer of Jesus in John 17 and then answer the following questions. What similarities and differences do you note? Is unity alluded to in Matthew 6? If so, where? What aspects of God’s character are appealed to in each prayer? 
2.	Write a journal entry that explores your honest response to the relationships and mission to which you have been called. 
3.	Collect recent news articles about Seventh-day Adventists. Sort them into two groups: (1) articles that reflect a positive image of God’s character and (2) articles that reflect badly on God’s character. Choose one or two for reflection. What actions might have led to a different outcome? Was disunity a factor in any of the outcomes? Why, or why not?
