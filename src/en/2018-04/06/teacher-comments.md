**Summary**: Metaphors of the New Testament church illustrate the vital nature of dependence upon God and the harmonious relationships that God’s people are called to have with one another.

### STEP 1—Motivate

**Spotlight on Scripture**: 1 Corinthians 12:12

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: Our relationship with God brings us into a unique relationship with other Christians. It impacts the way we see ourselves and one another as we are brought face-to-face with our common dependence upon God for all our needs and our common call to serve Him. 

**Just for Teachers**: The story discussed below illustrates how a single relationship can alter other relationships. Help your class see the importance of the initial relationship and the role that a common mission plays in changing relationships between those involved with the mission.

**Opening Discussion**: When Wendy accepted a job at a hospital in a foreign country, she found herself surrounded by unfamiliar people in an unfamiliar culture. Her immediate workmates hailed from a variety of ethnic backgrounds and adhered to an assortment of the world’s major religions. At first glance, she had little in common with them. However, as she spent time with her new workmates, she discovered that one had trained in her country. Another was an Orthodox Jew and, as such, respected the Sabbath. But it was not these common elements that impacted her relationships the most. It was their common relationship to the hospital that really brought them together. They were all overly tired from long hours on call. They all sat together doing paperwork and dictation late into the evening and attended the same conferences. They all rejoiced when long-term clients became well enough to go home, and they grieved when others died. Their common relationship to the hospital changed the way they related to one another so that within a few months they were socializing regularly outside of the hospital.   

**Questions for Discussion**: Describe one relationship that transformed the relationships you had with other people. What factors about the primary relationship made the difference in your other relationships? How might this help you to understand the ways in which your relationship with Jesus changes your relationship with others?

### STEP 2—Explore

**Just for Teachers**: The Bible contains a great many images of the church. Five metaphors have been introduced in the Standard Edition lesson this week. This section explores three images that have been chosen to represent the relationships the church has with each member of the Godhead. As you examine each metaphor, try to understand how it portrays the unity God desires for His church, and, also, explore how the relevant Member of the Godhead is portrayed as contributing to that unity.

**Bible Commentary**

**I. The People of God** (Review 1 Peter 2:9; Exodus 19:5, 6; and Leviticus 26:12.)

The apostle Paul’s identification of the church as the people of God connected the New Testament church with the history and promises of Israel. Jewish believers would immediately associate the phrase with their rich history of being a covenant people, for the term is, at its very core, a relational one. The emphasis of the term, however, is not on the members of the people of God, but on the actions and character of God. It is God alone who has created this people. It is God who has chosen His people, and it is God who purchases, redeems, and saves His people. We are, therefore, God’s possession and take our identity and direction from Him.

The term people of God highlights the privileged status we share because we have been set apart to serve a God who is just and merciful. As individuals and as a group of believers, we have experienced the grace of God. The metaphor of the people of God thus also emphasizes the shared aspects of our journey. Together we have been chosen and set apart, and we have experienced God’s grace and favor. Together we share an identity rooted in Christ, and together we have a shared purpose to proclaim the wonders of our God. The metaphor, people of God, has the potential to unite us as we recognize our common failed past, our common privileged present, and our common future hope in Christ.

**Consider This**: Why does Peter emphasize the idea of becoming a people? What difference should our identity in God make to our everyday lives? 

**II. The Temple of the Holy Spirit** (Review 1 Corinthians 3:16, 17.)

The metaphor of the church as a temple likely raised differing pictures in the minds of Paul’s audience. Jewish believers would connect the church with Israel’s history and the magnificent temple in Jerusalem that was central to Jewish religion and culture. Gentile believers outside of Palestine may have visualized pagan Greco-Roman temples, such as that of Apollo. Nevertheless, Paul’s point about the church as a temple would be understood by all. Ancient Near Eastern temples shared common features and symbolism. Temples were carefully constructed from the finest materials, for they were primarily a dwelling place for divinity. While God could not be contained in a building, the presence of His temple provided assurance that God, nevertheless, dwelt among His people as He had promised. Because God dwelt in the temple, the temple was both holy and a place of communication between God and His people. The presence of a temple also proclaimed the strength and power of God. It was an affirmation that God was interested and involved in the affairs of His people. 

The church, like a temple, must be a fitting representative of the God that dwells within it. It is thus called to reflect His character. While each individual member is called to represent God, the reflection of God’s character by the church, as a whole, provides a stronger witness to a watching world. Consequently, a united church demonstrates both the character and the power of God. Damage to the united demonstration of God’s character destroys God’s temple by impacting its use and function.  

**Consider This**: How is God’s presence visible in His church? In what specific ways is the function of the temple of the Holy Spirit compromised by destruction of the unity of the church? Paul warns that God will destroy the person who destroys the temple. Why is the penalty for this destruction so harsh? 

**III. The Body of Christ** (Review 1 Corinthians 12:12–26.)

The metaphor of the body was used by some Greco-Roman politicians, such as Menenius Agrippa, to emphasize the unity of the state; so, Paul’s inclusion of this metaphor to illustrate unity was not new. However, Paul’s interpretation of the metaphor was very different from that of Menenius. The politician saw unity as occurring when the lower classes understood their place in the hierarchy and submitted to the rule of the ruling patricians. Paul, on the other hand, encouraged the church to honor the weaker and less visible members of the body, who were equally necessary for the function of the church. The diversity of the members of the church was to be embraced, for God Himself had arranged the various parts and roles. Of equal importance in Paul’s illustration of the body is the interconnectedness of each part. Each part needs the other and, in turn, is affected by the success and failure of the others. 

**Consider This**: Paul’s view of the body clashed with the views of ancient politicians. How does the metaphor of the body continue to challenge the attitudes and values portrayed in society around us?

### STEP 3—Apply

**Just for Teachers**: All the metaphors of church unity studied in this lesson include a reference to a member of the Trinity. Help your class to understand the central role that our relationship to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit play in bringing this unity to fruition.

**Application Questions:**

1.	The metaphor of the people of God calls us to recognize that our identity is in God. In what ways does our identity in God relate to unity? We often identify ourselves in other ways, such as nationality. What identities do you tend to reveal before you reveal to others your identity in God? Do these alternate identities or labels get in the way of unity in the church?
2.	How does viewing other people as members of the body of Christ impact the way you see and interact with them? How does this impact the way you see yourself and your own value?

**Activity**: Write a letter of appreciation for the gifts or service of a member of your church who usually doesn’t get much recognition. 

### STEP 4—Create

**Just for Teachers**: This activity reviews the principles found in the metaphors studied this week and applies them in a new way. It creates awareness of the importance of conveying the principles of Scripture in a way that can be easily understood in each culture and time period in history.

**Activities:** The New Testament authors used metaphors that were understood easily by their readers. Jewish listeners could visualize the temple and knew its importance and heritage. Likewise, most listeners were familiar with shepherds and their relationships with sheep. However, these ideas are more difficult for us to visualize today. Brainstorm possible twenty-first century metaphors of church unity that would be understood more readily in your own culture. Then choose one of these ideas to write a parable or tell a story to emphasize how the church should function.
