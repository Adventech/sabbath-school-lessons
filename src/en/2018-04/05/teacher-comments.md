### STEP 1—Motivate

**Spotlight on Scripture**: Acts 2:42–47

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: As we share in worship and fellowship, the Holy Spirit works through us to transform our attitudes to that of love for one another. This transformation gives glory to God.

**Just for Teachers**: There are multiple benefits of the togetherness described in Acts 2. The most important factor highlighted by this story is that working together with a common purpose helps us to forget the things that divide us, thus transforming the ways that we see one another.

**Opening Discussion**: During the first half of the nineteenth century on the North American continent, Christian churches experienced a religious revival commonly called the Second Great Awakening. Although it is often remembered for its excessive levels of emotionalism, this revival had other important effects. Convicted not only of their own sins but also of the evil around them, Christians set out to reform their society. Thousands of Christians joined voluntary societies that had singular aims, such as reducing alcohol consumption or reducing poverty. Many of the societies were quite successful in achieving their aims. But there was a side effect that no one expected. Christians from different denominational backgrounds, who normally fought over doctrine or simply ignored each other, found that working closely together on a project with common goals led them to enjoy one another’s company and want to worship together. Like the church in Acts, the Christians involved in voluntary societies found that spending time in close relationships with others who shared a common motivation bred harmony between them.

**Questions for Discussion**: Think of other examples in which working closely together with a common goal or motivation unexpectedly brought people together in harmony. What was the central motivation that brought the early church together? How often do you remember the motivation that brings you together with other Christians? 

### STEP 2—Explore

**Just for Teachers**: Discussions of Acts 2:42–46 often focus on the list of behaviors that the early church practiced. As you explore these verses, try to move the focus to attitudes, values, and relationships. Consider what motivated the behaviors.

**Bible Commentary**

Acts 2 provides a glimpse into the life of the first Christian community. It was a community experiencing the power of the Holy Spirit and convicted of the importance of the message of the gospel. It was also a community that demonstrated God’s love practically through a profound unity in the Spirit that is repeatedly highlighted in the early chapters of Acts. Such unity does not occur by accident.   

**I.	Defining Devotion** (Review Acts 2 with your class.)

The early followers of Jesus are described as continually devoting themselves to the apostles’ teaching and fellowship. To give devotion to something involves being faithful to it. The wholehearted attention that faithfulness demands means that devotion cannot happen without a significant level of commitment and discipline. Therefore, devotion cannot be ordered or imposed on others. Rather, true devotion flows from one’s own attitudes and priorities. It is a response of the heart. 

**Consider This**: How would you describe devotion? What forms does devotion take in the twenty-first century? Are all these forms of devotion healthy? Why, or why not? 

**II. Devotion to God** (Review Acts 1:12–14 and 2:42–47 with your class.)

The first object of the early church’s devotion was God. This is demonstrated in their devotion to adhering to the teachings of the apostles, prayer, and to the praising of God. The commitment paved the way for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost (Acts 1:12–14) and continued after it. Devotion to God thus preceded any change in the Christian’s interactions with other people. As believers accepted Christ and devoted themselves to Him, they placed themselves in a position where the Holy Spirit could work to transform their lives. Luke is careful to emphasize that it was not only one or two believers in isolation that practiced wholehearted commitment to Christ. All those who experienced God’s power were together and shared the same devotion. But we should not forget that the loving interactions with others both inside and outside of their community were also acts of devotion to God. When we respond to God’s grace in tangible ways, we honor Him. 

**Consider This**: What underlying motivation was there for the early Christians to be devoted to God? What might total devotion to God look like in the twenty-first century? Is emulation of the early church feasible?

**III. Devotion to Fellowship** (Review Acts 2:42–44 with your class.)

The word “fellowship” is translated from the Greek word koinōnia. It is derived from the Greek root koinos, which means “common,” “shared,” or “mutual.” It thus referred to what was held in common between people. The word koinōnia itself was often used in Greek literature to describe the closeness, commitment, and mutual bonds of the marriage relationship. It includes the ideas of close association in which there is a mutual sharing with each other, as well as the idea of goodwill that manifests itself as sharing with others. In Acts 2, fellowship is expressed as shared time, shared activity, shared mission, and shared possessions. However, what the believers shared in common only occurred because of the foundation they had in common: that is a shared relationship with Christ. While it is easy to list the activities of the early church that were a manifestation of fellowship, fellowship in the New Testament is primarily about relationship, not activity. Believers had relationships with one another and shared a common life precisely because they had a relationship with Christ. The nature of the relationships between believers was an intimate one. This intimacy was witnessed in the early church through the unusual act of sharing meals with other believers, regardless of socioeconomic status or ethnic background.  

**Consider This**: What key words do you find in Acts 2:42–46 that reveal more about the nature of the fellowship that the early Christians shared? Why does Luke emphasize the idea of joy and thankfulness in this passage? 

**IV. The Results of Devotion** (Review Acts 2:45–47 and Acts 4:32–37 with your class.)

As the believers devoted themselves to God and fellowship, they not only recognized their common bond in Christ, but they also became more aware of the needs of those around them. They responded by helping in any way they could, including selling their property and distributing their possessions. The Greek construction of verses 44–45, with the repeated use of the imperfect tense, suggests that this was not a one-time event but, rather, a regular and ongoing practice in the community. It was a response that grew out of love for God and for one another. However, this awareness of the needs of those around them was not the only result of the devotion of the early believers. Luke also emphasizes their joy, which was expressed in thankfulness and praise to God and the fact that other people were attracted to this healthy and vibrant Christian community. 

**Consider This**: What other positive results might you expect in a community fully devoted to God? If giving was a voluntary action by members of the church community, why did Ananias and Sapphira die? 

### STEP 3—Apply

**Just for Teachers**: This section seeks to help uncover the motivations for current behavior and devotion and then encourages consideration of how members can put themselves in a place where the Holy Spirit can transform those attitudes. 

**Thought Questions**:

1.	What things or people claim your devotion? What is the basis for your commitment to these things? Do any of them aid in the mission of the church? Do you need to rethink the focus of your devotion?
2.	In what ways do you express your joy and thanksgiving for the grace you have experienced in Christ?

**Application Questions:**

1.	In what tangible ways can you spend more time growing together with other Christians in worship and fellowship? 
2.	What obstacles get in the way of the intimate sharing of your journey with Christ? How might you move past these obstacles? 

### STEP 4—Create

**Just for Teachers**: The following activities are designed to help members respond to areas in which the Holy Spirit has challenged them to renew their devotion to God or fellowship. They provide practical first steps toward improving fellowship between members. 

**Individual Activity**:

Write a letter to God in which you confess the objects and people who have been the center of your devotion, and then ask Him to bring you to a place where your devotion is centered in Him. 

**Group Activities:**

1.	Develop a plan for your Sabbath School class to deepen their fellowship with one another outside of Sabbath morning.
2.	Plan a shared activity with the goal of helping others or furthering the mission of the church. Then invite fellow members to join you, including those with whom you may have strained relationships.
