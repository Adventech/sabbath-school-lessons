**Key Text**: Revelation 4:8–11

**The Student Will**:

- **Know**: Define true worship and its role in the great controversy between God and Satan.
- **Feel**: Have a sense of awe and thankfulness for who God is and what He has done for them. 
- **Do**: Worship God with both heart and mind. 

**Learning Outline**:

1.	Know: True Worship
	+ What is meant by the word “worship”? What actions might be considered part of worship?
	+ How can we distinguish true and false worship from each other?
	+ How can we ensure that God remains the center of our worship?
D.	What role does worship play in each of the three angels’ messages?

2.	Feel: The Greatness of God
	+ What aspect of God’s character is the most meaningful to you? Which aspect speaks most to your situation today?
	+ What feelings and emotions come to mind when you consider what God has done for you?

3.	Do: Responding With Our Whole Being
	+ How is worshiping God with our hearts different from worshiping God with our minds?  
	+ What do these two aspects of worship look like in practice? 
	+ How is it possible to magnify God when we cannot make Him larger? What is magnified in the process of our worship? 

**Summary**: Worship involves showing honor and respect, as well as serving and obedience. The character and redemptive actions of God call forth a response of worship from His creatures as together they recognize their dependence upon God. 

### STEP 1—Motivate

**Spotlight on Scripture**: Revelation 14:6, 7

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: True worship is a heartfelt response to who God is and what He has done for us. 

**Just for Teachers**: Worship is a key issue in the end times. The identity of who is worshiped defines our allegiance. As you open the lesson, emphasize the importance of identifying correctly who is worshiped.

**Opening Discussion**: One summer day, John decided to pick a few of the abundant mushrooms that grew near his home. He had taken a course in mushroom hunting and knew something about the identification of mushrooms. He spotted a group of mushrooms that he thought were edible and picked them for his evening meal. He intended to check them with a field guide on his return home to be sure they were edible, but by the time he reached home, he was running late for an appointment. Sure in his own mind that the mushrooms were indeed edible, he cooked and ate them. But John’s identification of the mushrooms had been wrong. He had eaten a dangerously poisonous species of mushroom that destroys the liver and frequently results in death. Eight hours later, John started vomiting, and tests showed that his liver and kidneys had been damaged badly. While John survived, his mistake nearly cost him his life.

The apostle John warns us that we need to be equally careful about the identification of the object of our worship. God is the only object we should be worshiping, and our worship should reflect our allegiance to Him. 

**Questions for Discussion**: Why was distinguishing between edible and poisonous mushrooms difficult?  What could John have used to distinguish between them? How might your answer help you to think about how you distinguish between true and false systems of worship?

### STEP 2—Explore

**Just for Teachers**: This study section examines the nature of worship and its role in the great controversy. Emphasize that understanding what constitutes true worship is essential to preventing Satan from deceiving us with counterfeit forms of worship. Don’t let the class get sidetracked into discussions about worship styles and preferences. 

**Bible Commentary**

**I. The Nature of Worship** (Review Revelation 4:8–11 with your class.)

The Bible uses multiple words in Greek and Hebrew to describe different aspects of worship. The Hebrew words for worship emphasize honor, respect, and reverence by focusing on the actions of bowing down, prostrating, or otherwise humbling oneself before another person. However, worship in the Old Testament is not confined to bodily actions. It also includes the concepts of obedience and service that demonstrate the reality of our worship. Isaiah clearly indicates that simply going through the motions of worship activities without obedience is not worship at all (Isa. 1:10–17, Isaiah 58). 

In the New Testament, we find a similar variety of words that can mean to bow down, revere, show honor and devotion, or to serve. The most common word for worship in the New Testament is proskyneō, which literally means “to kiss toward.” It likely reflects the custom of showing honor to a king or official by bowing before them and kissing their feet, an action understood as an admission of dependence or submission to the person in authority (see William F. Arndt, F. Wilbur Gingrich, Frederick W. Danker, and Walter Bauer, A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2000], p. 882). In using this word to describe the worship of God, we can therefore deduce that more than the physical action of kissing or bowing down is intended. To worship God is to recognize the greatness and majesty of God, to understand that He is the Creator and we are creatures, and to admit one’s own unworthiness, helplessness, and absolute dependence upon Him. Such admission also carries with it the implication of willingness to accept God’s lordship over our lives.

True worship has several important features. First and foremost, it is directed at God and Him alone (Deut. 6:13, Matt. 4:10). Second, it is never forced. It is a spontaneous response to the character of God and His redemptive actions on our behalf. It begins from the heart and not from the expectations of others. Third, worship is not simply a Sabbath morning activity or a part of a worship service. It is a lifestyle. We are to live and breathe our responses to what God has done for us. The living creatures in the throne room, pictured in Revelation 4, worshiped continually day and night. While such intense focused worship is not possible in our lives, this figure undercores the idea that each word and action of ours should bring honor to the name of God. 

True worship has the potential to unite us in ways not possible otherwise. When we focus our lives on worshiping the Center of our faith, we are less likely to see the things that divide us. Whether alone or in a worship service, we worship with others around the world, giving praise to God. Thus, worship gives us the opportunity to recognize that we are part of something beyond ourselves. At the same time, worship reminds us of our dependence upon God. Pride and jealousy, which contribute to disharmony, dissolve when we recognize that we are all creatures who depend on God.

**Consider This**: In what sense can obedience be considered worship? What does a life of worship look like? 

**II. Worship and the Great Controversy** (Review Revelation 14:6–12 with your class.)

The importance of understanding true worship is highlighted by the central role that worship plays in the three angels’ messages and in the wider context of the great controversy between God and Satan. The battle commenced with Satan’s rebellion in heaven and his pride-filled comparison of himself with God (Isa. 14:14). The cosmic war continues with his challenging the very character of God. While God demonstrates His character through an outpouring of love and grace, which calls forth a response of worship, Satan calls forth worship through deceit. Satan seeks to remove focus from God by setting up an alternate system of worship. The message of the first angel is a reminder that the only person who deserves worship is God, the Creator of the universe. Honoring the seventh-day Sabbath that He sanctified is an act of worship and allegiance to Him. However, to limit the meaning only to the day of worship is to miss the sweeping implications of the message. Worship of the Creator occurs not only by direct worship of Him on the day that He appointed, but also by valuing His creation. You cannot truly worship the Creator while you destroy and abuse what He has created. The message of the second angel displays the love and grace of God, providing a warning for those who have been deceived by counterfeit approaches to salvation and worship. Finally, in the third angel’s message, we see that choosing the wrong focus of worship ultimately leads to death, while choosing to worship God alone leads to life. Because God is the Creator and Sustainer of life, we would expect nothing less. When we are disconnected from the Source of life, there is only death.  

**Consider This**: Why do you think that worship is central to the three angels’ messages? How can you be sure that you are worshiping the Creator and not falling for one of Satan’s schemes to distract you? In what ways do the messages of the three angels draw us together in unity? 

### STEP 3—Apply

**Just for Teachers**: We often limit the extent of worship to what happens on a Sabbath morning. However, worship is much broader than this. Help your class to explore the wider dimensions of worship. 

**Application Questions:**

1.	Worship is much more than the singing of songs and praying. Why do you think we rarely consider worship outside of the Sabbath and other religious services?
2.	Why do you think that some individuals find a lack of meaning in worship services? How might this relate to the rest of their week? 
3.	How can we make worship a lifestyle?
4.	Is your current participation in worship activities a response from the heart?  

### STEP 4—Create

**Just for Teachers**: We are called to worship the God who has created and redeemed us. The activities provided help participants to focus on God, the Center of our worship. 

**Activities:** 

1.	Create a responsive reading for a worship service that helps people to focus on different aspects of God’s character.
2.	Plan an evening of prayer. Structure it so that participants are presented with a clear focus for prayer on a regular basis over the evening, and vary the mode of prayer for each focus. 
3.	Listen to a song that extols the greatness or majesty of God. Then pray that God will help you to experience the beauty and character of God in new ways.
4.	Present a basket of common household objects to your class. Ask the group to consider how God is like each of the items in the basket. Then thank God for helping you to remember the many dimensions of His nature and character.
