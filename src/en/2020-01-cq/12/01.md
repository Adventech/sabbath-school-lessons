Read This Week’s Passage: Daniel 8

Cleansing the Universe

Some elements of culture glorify sin. It is portrayed in movies and media. The masses pay to consume the reenactment of sin. The fact is that culture doesn’t view sin as sin. It is simply seen as human nature in its evolutionary progression. Even the Christian community thinks of sin in flippant, trivial terms, where grace is portrayed in a way that minimizes the gravity of what sin really is.

The Bible illustrates through the sanctuary that sin cost heaven everything. In order to remove it from the universe forever, it will require a painstaking process of transparency and transference. The cleansing of the universe forever from sin must involve the cleansing of the sanctuary from sin. This lesson will explore that cleansing as found in Daniel chapter 8.
