Daniel’s prayer encapsulates the spirit of Christ’s love for His embattled church. Daniel intercedes on behalf of his people even as Christ intercedes on our behalf before the Father. Daniel asks for the mercy of God on behalf of his people even as Jesus pleads mercy on our behalf. Daniel identifies himself with God’s people’s sins; Jesus becomes sin for us and identifies Himself with us.

The church is portrayed in Scripture as the bride of Christ. Though it has its faults and shortcomings, it is still the apple of God’s eye. As Ellen White states, “Enfeebled and defective as it may appear, the church is the one object upon which God bestows in a special sense His supreme regard. It is the theater of His grace, in which He delights to reveal His power to transform hearts” (White, The Acts of the Apostles, 12).

Daniel exhibits the spirit of Jesus and gives us a picture of the love of Christ on behalf of His church. It is the same spirit that we, as Christians living in the end of time, are to have as the church goes through the final crisis.
