`How does our world currently view the papacy?`

`How does our culture view the position that the papacy is the little horn power of Daniel 7?`

`How can we love the members of the system yet be faithful to sharing what the Bible says about the system?`

`How does the backdrop of the great controversy between Christ and Satan reframe how you share about the little horn power? What does God revealing the little horn power reveal also about the character of God?`

`What are some practical pointers for how we should and should not share the message of Daniel 7?`

`More than a revelation of the new superpower, what is the larger message when we zoom out from Daniel 7?`
