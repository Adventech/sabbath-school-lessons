### Introduction

Can the book of Daniel have any practical bearing on our lives today? Is it relevant to twenty-first century living? The answer is found in the words of Jesus in Matthew 24:15, where He gives an unmistakable book endorsement: “’Therefore when you see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet standing in the holy place’ (whoever reads let him understand),”

Notice these ideas found within Jesus’ endorsement of the book of Daniel:

1. Daniel is an inspired prophet and by implication the book of Daniel is trustworthy. 
2. The book of Daniel should be read and studied. 
3. The book of Daniel will be understood. 
4. The prophecies within the book of Daniel will be fulfilled. 
5. The book of Daniel’s message is relevant and practical for end time living. (Leslie Hardinge, Jesus is My Judge, p. 1)

According to Jesus, the book of Daniel is indeed relevant for twenty-first century end-time living. Daniel literally means “God is my Judge.” Laodicea, God’s last day church, means a “people judged.” Thus, Daniel can be seen as a type of God’s people that will be living during the time of judgment just prior to the second coming of Jesus. 

The book of Daniel has within it two main genres: stories and prophecies. There are eight stories; six of the stories depict characteristics that we are to seek to emulate as the prophecies are being fulfilled and two of the stories depict characteristics that we are to seek to avoid as the prophecies are being fulfilled (c.f. Leslie Hardinge, Jesus is My Judge, p. 6).

This series of inVerse lessons on the book of Daniel will be divided into two main sections. The first section will be focusing on the eight stories in Daniel and drawing practical applications to our daily lives. The second section will be dealing with the main prophecies in Daniel. 

Ellen White indicates there are rich blessings in store for those who read and study the book of Daniel: “When the books of Daniel and Revelation are better understood, believers will have an entirely different religious experience. They will be given such glimpses of the open gates of heaven that heart and mind will be impressed with the character that all must develop in order to realize the blessedness which is to be the reward of the pure in heart” (Ellen White, Testimonies to Ministers, p. 114).

The book of Daniel is relevant, enriching, practical, and essential for end-time living. 

May the promised blessing found within Jesus’ endorsement of Daniel be yours.
