Read This Week’s Passage: Daniel 10

Delay

We live in a world of instant gratification and quick fixes. Our devices give us access to instant answers right at our fingertips. We hate waiting for anything. If our computers are keeping us waiting, we simply upgrade to newer, faster ones. Waiting is considered a waste of time in the twenty-first century.

In the tenth chapter, Daniel urgently prays and waits for three weeks before his prayers are answered. Thereafter, the angel comes and explains the reason for the delayed response. Often, when we wait for God to respond, we do not have the luxury of an explanation for the delay. Yet waiting on God is a critical piece of the Christian development puzzle.
