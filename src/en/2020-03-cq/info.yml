  title: "Foundations of Discipleship"
  description: "For a while, the word discipleship was a buzzword in many religious and spiritual circles. The religious ones spun the term to mean the implementation of ritual and religious habits. Their emphasis was on discipline and training. The spiritual ones reinterpreted discipleship to mean following the esoteric Jesus of history. Recast as a hippie vagabond life, discipleship meant being free from theory and theology but obsessed, instead, with an esoteric and mystical quest for fulfillment."
