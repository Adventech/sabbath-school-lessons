title:  Walking in Wisdom

What is the most important truth that we, as Christians, can know? Of course, it is that Jesus Christ died for our sins and that, through faith in Him, we can have eternal life. This is a truth that we could have never figured out on our own. Instead, it was a truth that had to be told, or revealed, to us. And it has been revealed to us—in the Word of God.

There’s a great deal of truth, knowledge, and wisdom that we would never have known were it not for what God has revealed to us in His Word. But this knowledge and wisdom have not been given to us just as knowledge, just as something to know. Rather, we are to live out in our own lives this truth, this knowledge, and this wisdom.

`Read Colossians 4:5, 6. In what situations does Paul indicate we especially need to “walk in wisdom”? Why might that be?`

Unfortunately, as Christians, sometimes we are anything but Christian! And, as Paul indicated (quoting Isaiah 52:5), Israel was also a stumbling block for unbelievers: “For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you” (Rom. 2:24). How we act toward others, especially those not of our faith, matters a lot (see Titus 2:5, 2 Pet. 2:2). A Christian home, a gathering of youth for prayer rather than for mischief; simple kindnesses; and a calm, patient spirit speak volumes to those who are watching to see whether our profession is genuine or not.

In Colossians 4:6, Paul focuses especially on the words we speak: “Let your speech always be gracious” (ESV). More than simply kind or polite, the words we speak should be prompted and permeated by God’s grace through the influence of the Holy Spirit.

“Seasoned with salt.” Opposite to the world’s definition of “salty” speech, our words should be fitting and appealing to those we address.

“That you may know how you ought to answer each one” (NKJV). Only the Holy Spirit can give us the right words at the right time for the right purpose and prepare the minds of the hearers for the message we “must” share (here, too, dei is used—see yesterday’s comments on Colossians 4:4).

`Think about your words, your actions, and how you walk before others. What message are you sending about your faith and what it means to be a Christian?`
