Paul’s relationship with the Colossians was different from his relationship with those in Philippi. He included them among those who “have not seen my face in the flesh” (Col. 2:1). Nevertheless, Paul assures them, as he did the Philippians, that he thanks God for them and is “always” praying for them.

`Read Colossians 1:3–8. What three things does Paul thank God for?`

Paul brings together the three virtues that he mentions in other places: faith, hope, and love (see 1 Cor. 13:13, 1 Thess. 1:3, 1 Thess. 5:8). Notice that Paul doesn’t credit the Colossians for these things. He thanks the Father for them, because as James says they are among the “good and perfect” gifts that we receive from Him (James 1:17, NIV). When we see the love God has for us, it leads us to faith in Christ (Eph. 2:4–8), and we receive the hope of heaven. Peter describes it as “an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that does not fade away, reserved in heaven for you” (1 Pet. 1:4, NKJV).

Paul also emphasizes that the gospel is trustworthy because it is based on “the word of truth.” This is an expression Paul uses elsewhere in reference to the inspired word of God (see 2 Cor. 6:7, 2 Tim. 2:15). Unlike “the word of men,” it works “effectually” in those who believe (1 Thess. 2:13) and accomplishes God’s will (Isa. 55:11). So, when the gospel is proclaimed, the power of God is manifested through the work of the Holy Spirit on the hearts of the hearers, and people respond. The gospel itself produces the fruit because it is “the word of life” (Phil. 2:16).

Perhaps what is most amazing is the spread of the gospel in such a short period of time. Within about thirty years of Christ’s death and resur­rection, Paul could already say it had spread “in all the world” (Col. 1:6). A little later in the same chapter, he says the gospel “was preached to every creature under heaven” (Col. 1:23, NKJV). The extensive Roman road system made possible rapid communication and travel, which is how Paul’s epistles could be circulated so widely and quickly. But it is the power of God working through the word that gives birth to spiritual life in a person (James 1:18, 1 Pet. 1:23), making them a new creature in Christ (2 Cor. 5:17).

`In Colossians 1:5, Paul writes about “the hope which is laid up for you in heaven.” What is your understanding of that hope, and why does it apply to you personally, even though you are truly unworthy?`
