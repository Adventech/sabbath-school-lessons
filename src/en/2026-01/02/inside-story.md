#### Messenger of God

Oscar stood still, praying, as three barking, snarling dogs surrounded him outside a house in Kenya. The owner, who had unleased the dogs as Oscar approached the house, came over. “Who are you?” he demanded.

“I’m a messenger of God,” Oscar said.

“What message has God sent you with?” the man said.

“It’s the message of God,” Oscar said. “Can I come in?”

The man called off the dogs and tied them up.

He looked at Oscar expectantly after they entered the house. “Let’s pray,” Oscar said. The man didn’t close his eyes. Oscar prayed and then began discussing the first five books of the Bible, the Pentateuch.

The man wasn’t a Christian. He belonged to a major, non-Christian world religion, but he knew those books of the law. He asked many questions, and the two men became friends. Today, the man and his wife are Seventh-day Adventists.

On another occasion, a homeowner expressed interest when Oscar offered Bible lessons. He sent away his three children, ages 6, 8, and 13. As they left, Oscar saw that they were limping in pain. “Let the children come here so we can pray,” he said. Then he saw that the children had chiggers, a tiny mite with parasitic larvae that live on or under the skin and cause irritation.

Oscar prayed for the children and left to buy medication.

The family thought that the chiggers were caused by witchcraft. But when Oscar returned, he helped the family clean their house and bedding. He instructed the parents to bathe the children, and then he provided the medication. The children were clean. Oscar prayed for the children again, and he studied the Bible with the parents. Later, the family became Adventist and sold land for the construction of a new Adventist church.

In sharing the gospel, Oscar also goes from church to church on Sundays. In Kenya, it’s a tradition to allow visitors to greet church members. But once, a church leader invited Oscar to a worship service and then refused to allow him to speak upon learning that he was an Adventist. Oscar stayed for the worship service. As he left, he recognized several members as his neighbors, and he went over to greet them.

“The Bible is like a big ocean, and this is not the time to wait for the pastor to come and teach you,” he said. “I have lessons that you can study yourself.”

Seven people accepted the Voice of Prophecy Discovery Bible lessons on the spot. Others were wary but later agreed to take the lessons. Today, 43 people from the church are studying the Bible with Oscar. “Not bad for a meeting where I wasn’t allowed to speak,” he said with a smile.
