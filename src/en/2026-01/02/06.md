`Read Colossians 1:9–12. What specific requests do you find in Paul’s prayer?`

Paul prays “that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will.” Paul describes knowing God’s will as “wisdom and spiritual understanding” (Col. 1:9, NKJV). Wisdom comes, first of all, by trusting God fully, being willing to do His will (John 7:17), and not leaning on our own understanding (Prov. 3:5). But the question often arises, “What is God’s will for me in this situation?” There are four main sources from which we may learn God’s will as we seek it prayerfully:

1.	The most important source of wisdom is the Bible. “Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path” (Ps. 119:105, NKJV).

2.	God has given us special wisdom for the last days through the Spirit of Prophecy (Rev. 12:17, Rev. 19:10) as manifested though the writings of Ellen White. The Bible encourages us to “believe in the Lord your God, and you shall be established; believe His prophets, and you shall prosper” (2 Chron. 20:20, NKJV).

3.	God’s will and leading may also be known through providential circumstances, by asking Him to open or close doors (see Col. 4:3).

4.	The Holy Spirit guides us once we have learned to recognize His voice: “Your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, / ‘This is the way, walk in it,’ / Whenever you turn to the right hand / Or whenever you turn to the left” (Isa. 30:21, NKJV).

Paul prays that the Colossians may “walk worthy of the Lord” (Col. 1:10, NKJV). Of course, no one is inherently “worthy,” but God counts us worthy by His grace and calls us to live in accordance with that high calling (Eph. 4:1, 1 Thess. 2:12, NKJV). Paul uses the verb “walk” or “walked” three more times in this letter alone (Col. 2:6, Col. 3:7, Col. 4:5). It means to live and act in accordance with God’s law (Exod. 18:20), which is possible only through the work of the Holy Spirit (Ezek. 36:27).

Paul also prays that their (and our) lives may be “fully pleasing” to the Lord and then lists several ways to do that: “Being fruitful in every good work” (Col. 1:9, 10, NKJV); then “increasing in the knowledge of God” (Col. 1:10, NKJV); and, finally, in “giving thanks” (Col. 1:12, NKJV).

`If someone were to ask you, “How do you know that God is leading you in one direction or another?” how would you answer—and why?`
