### Read for This Week’s Study
Phil. 1:1–18, 1 Cor. 13:1–8, Jer. 17:9, Col. 1:1–12, 1 Pet. 1:4, Ps. 119:105, Isa. 30:21.

> <p>Memory Text:</p>
> “Being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ” (Philippians 1:6, NKJV).

Paul quite intentionally begins his epistles with words of ­greeting—and thanksgiving. “Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ” (Col. 1:2, 3, NKJV).

We, like Paul, have much to be thankful for. We have experienced God’s grace in profound ways—ways that even angels cannot comprehend. The same is true of God’s gift of peace, which embraces harmony with God and the hope flowing from God’s love.

On a human level, we can give and show appreciation to others and hope that people appreciate the things we do for them. Parents pray that their children will love God and appreciate someday, if not now, the real sacrifices they’ve made to give them the best upbringing they could. But, as human beings, we make many mistakes, and we learn from them (or at least we should).

This week we’ll consider Paul’s opening words of thanksgiving and prayer in Philippians and Colossians, which may enrich and strengthen our own prayer life.
