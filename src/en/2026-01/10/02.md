Job asked, “Where can wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding?” (Job 28:12, NKJV). Paul answers: in Christ, “in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge” (Col. 2:3, NKJV; compare 1 Cor. 1:30). If we have Christ, we have everything, even the “full assurance of understanding” the purpose of life (Col. 2:2, NKJV). Through Him the mystery of God, which embraces the entire plan of salvation, has been revealed.

`Read Colossians 2:1–7. What is Paul’s purpose in writing this epistle?`

The Greek word paraklēthōsin means “encouraged” or “strengthened” (Col. 2:2). Paul’s desire is not only to help the believers in Colossae recognize false teachings but also to “unite” (sumbibasthentes) them in Christian love. The tense used for both verbs—“encouraged”  and “united”—indicates Paul’s confidence that this epistle will achieve its intended purpose.

He did, however, commend them for “your good order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ” (Col. 2:5, NKJV).

The Greek term taxis, translated “order,” is used in the New Testament in reference to the priestly orders of Aaron (Luke 1:8, Heb. 7:11) and Melchizedek (Heb. 5:6, 10, NKJV; Heb. 6:20, NKJV; Heb. 7:11, 17, NKJV), but Paul applies it to order in the church (1 Cor. 14:40), including here. Sometimes there is a tendency to consider church order and organization as merely an ecclesiastical institution with no theological significance.

But by prescribing proper decorum in worship (see, for example, 1 Corinthians 11), and specifying how elders and deacons should be selected (1 Timothy 3, Titus 1), Paul was very careful to preserve order in the church. Through these measures, God’s wisdom and the teachings of the Bible are preserved and promulgated.

As a result of the correct teaching that the Colossians had received from Paul’s associates, they had “steadfastness” of faith. It cannot be shaken because it rests on a solid biblical foundation that, if adhered to, would help protect them from the errors being promoted by the false teachers.
