#### Part I: Overview

Key Text: Colossians 2:16, 17

Study Focus: Colossians 2

In the conclusion of Colossians 1, Paul expresses his desire for his audience to grow in maturity in Christ (Col. 1:28). In Colossians 2, he elaborates on this idea. Colossians 2:1–5 sets the basis for what comes next. Paul wants his readers to “knit together in **love**” (Col. 2:2, NKJV, _emphasis added_), to attain “to all riches of the full assurance of **understanding**, to the **knowledge** of the mystery of God” (Col. 2:2, NKJV, _emphasis added_), and to strengthen their **faith** in Christ (Col. 2:5; _emphasis added_). In short, Paul wants his readers to grow in their faith, in their knowledge of the mystery of God, and in their love for Christ and for one another. In essence, Paul is exhorting his audience to be “complete” in Christ or, to use a different term, to demonstrate “maturity” in the exercise of their faith. In Colossians 2:6–23, Paul gives more details on how this goal can be accomplished.

This week’s lesson emphasizes two major themes:

1.	Completion in Christ involves knowing Him and growing in Him. This protects us from being misguided by false teachers.

2.	Completion in Christ also involves trusting solely in Him for salvation, not in regulations. It is important to note, however, that the Cross makes the ceremonial law unnecessary, not the moral law. The Old Testament ceremonial events were but shadows of the future work and sacrifice of Christ. These types came to an end with His death. The Ten Commandments, nevertheless, including the seventh-day Sabbath, are still valid for Christians.

#### Part II: Commentary

**Illustration**

“When James Garfield, later to become President of the United States, was principal of Hiram College in Ohio, one father asked him if the course of his [son’s] studies could not be shortened so that his son might be able to complete his studies in less time. ‘Certainly,’ Garfield replied. ‘But it all depends on what you want to make of your boy. When God wants to make an oak, he takes one hundred years. When he wants to make a squash, he requires only two months.’ ”—Michael P. Green, 1500 Illustrations for Biblical Preaching (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Books, 2000), p. 356.

Paul said, “He who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ” (Phil. 1:6, ESV). Commenting on David’s spiritual journey, Alan Redpath expresses the same idea: “The conversion of a soul is the miracle of a moment, the manufacture of a saint is the task of a lifetime.”—Redpath, The Making of a Man of God: Lessons From the Life of David (Grand Rapids, MI: Fleming H. Revell, 2013), from the Foreword.

**Knowing Christ and Growing in Him**

From reading Colossians, we can conclude that Paul was very worried about the infiltration of false teachers into the church. This concern is likely expressed by the sentence “What a great conflict I have for you” (Col. 2:1, NKJV). In this context, the term “conflict” probably means “anxiety” or “concern.”—William Arndt et al., A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2000), p. 17. The Greek word translated as “conflict” is used elsewhere in reference to a struggle against human or spiritual opposition (for instance, 1 Thess. 2:2). In this context, it is employed to describe the apostle’s “untiring labor—an intense wrestling and struggle for the spread, growth, and strengthening of the faith as the goal of his mission.”—David J. Williams, Paul’s Metaphors: Their Context and Character (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 1999), p. 290.

The term “conflict” comes from the context of sports, more specifically from the athletic contests. Thus, it suggests the idea of excruciating effort. These data indicate that Paul did not view dealing with false teachings as a minor matter. Should we? Very likely, by his conflict or struggle for the Colossians, Paul intended his prayers to be for them. Paul prayed that their hearts might be strengthened so that they would not be misled by false teachings. Paul wanted them to be “knit together in love, to reach all the riches of full assurance of understanding and the knowledge of God’s mystery, which is Christ” (Col. 2:2, ESV).

The concept of knowledge is very important in Colossians. Throughout the letter, Paul wants his audience to have knowledge of “the grace of God in truth” (Col. 1:6, NKJV); God’s “will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding” (Col. 1:9, NKJV); “the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles: which is Christ in you” (Col. 1:27, NKJV); “the mystery of God, both of the Father and of Christ” (Col. 2:2, NKJV). Thus, in short, Paul shows that the antidote against false teachings is knowledge of God and Christ (Col. 2:1–4, 8). This knowledge comes from the Word of God, as Paul hints in Colossians 3:16: “Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord” (NKJV).

**Christ, Our Only Hope of Salvation**

In Colossians 2:11–15, Paul extols Christ’s saving work for us. In Christ, we were circumcised “with the circumcision made without hands” (Col. 2:11, NKJV), meaning the work of Christ in our heart. We were “buried with Him in baptism” and “raised with Him” (Col. 2:12, NKJV). In other words, God made us alive with Christ and “forgave us all our sins” (Col. 2:13, NIV). In short, Paul is saying that Christ is our only hope of salvation.

However, some of Paul’s statements in Colossians 2, especially from Colossians 2:11–23, are used by many today to suggest that the apostle is talking about the cancellation of the Ten Commandments; more specifically, it is argued that the seventh-day Sabbath is no longer valid, nor binding upon Christians. Contrary to this assertion, Colossians 2 is not about the cancellation of the Ten Commandments. Paul implies several times throughout his letters, in Colossians and also elsewhere, that the Ten Commandments are valid for Christians, as one can see in the following passages.

Paul quotes the fifth commandment in Ephesians 6:2, 3; the sixth, seventh, and eighth in Romans 13:9; and the tenth in Romans 7:7 (and also in Romans 13:9). In Colossians 3:20, he repeats an exhortation that is found in Ephesians 6:1: “Children, obey your parents” (NKJV). Based on Ephesians 6:1–3, one can conclude that the exhortation “Children, obey your parents” (both in Eph. 6:1 and Col. 3:20) is grounded on the validity of the fifth commandment (Eph. 6:2, 3; compare with Exod. 20:12). In all these passages, it is implied that the Ten Commandments remain mandatory for believers under the new covenant. Additionally, the vice and virtue lists in the Pauline Epistles—and specially the vice list found in Colossians 3:5–9—are backgrounded by the Ten Commandments (see David W. Pao, Colossians & Philemon, Zondervan Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament [Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 2012], p. 220).

A non-Adventist scholar recognizes, “There are good reasons for believing . . . that the Ten Commandments . . . are still binding on us. When Jesus, for example, talks about ‘the commandments,’ it is clear that it is the Ten Commandments he has in view (Luke 18:20). Similarly, when Paul talks about the law in Romans 7:7, he is referring to the Ten Commandments.”—Iain D. Campbell, Opening Up Exodus, Opening Up Commentary (Leominster, UK: Day One Publications, 2006), p. 83.

Regarding the seventh-day Sabbath, the evidence from the New Testament points out that it is binding for believers under the new cove­nant. Like Jesus, Paul was a Sabbath keeper (see Luke 4:16, Acts 17:2). In Revelation 14:6, 7, an allusion to the fourth commandment underscores the validity of the seventh-day Sabbath for Christians. Similarly, when Paul and Barnabas protested against being worshiped by idolaters, they called attention to the worship of “the living God, who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and all things that are in them” (Acts 14:15, NKJV; see Exod. 20:11). It is also possible that in his portrayal of Christ’s preeminence in Colossians 1:15–20, Paul has both Genesis 1 and 2 and Exodus 20:8–11 in mind. These two passages have in common the theme of Sabbath (see John K. McVay, “Colossians,” in Ángel Manuel Rodríguez, ed., Andrews Bible Commentary: New Testament [Berrien Springs, MI: Andrews University Press, 2022], pp. 1745, 1751–1753).

Given that Paul was a Sabbath keeper, he clearly cannot be arguing for the cancellation of the Ten Commandments in Colossians 2:11–23. Thus, the “handwriting of requirements” (Col. 2:14, NKJV) nailed on the cross is not referring to the moral law. Instead, it may be a reference to the ceremonial law or a sort of debt certificate. Likewise, Colossians 2:16 is not discussing the weekly seventh-day Sabbath. Instead, the text may refer to (1) the ceremonial sabbaths, (2) the sacrifices offered during Jewish festivals or, perhaps, (3) keeping the seventh-day Sabbath for the wrong reasons. For details, see John K. McVay, “Colossians,” in Ángel Manuel Rodríguez, ed., Andrews Bible Commentary: New Testament (Berrien Springs, MI: Andrews University Press, 2022), pp. 1752, 1753.

#### Part III: Life Application

Meditate upon the following themes. Then ask your students to answer the questions at the end of the section.

Philippians 1:6 is certainly one of the most well-known passages in the Bible. We love this promise: “He who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ” (NKJV). It is essential to remember that completion in Christ involves the process of getting to know Him through His Word. Indeed, there is no way to remain in Him unless His words abide in us (John 15:7). From the Word of God we receive nourishment for spiritual growth (1 Pet. 2:2), which includes growth in faith (Rom. 10:17). As the psalmist says, “And those who know Your name will put their trust in You” (Ps. 9:10, NKJV). The knowledge of God and His Word prevents us from being misguided by false teachings.

The true knowledge of God naturally leads to submission and faithfulness to Him. In that regard, the moral law plays a critical role, since it teaches us about God’s character and reveals His will to us. Yet, some people say that the law is an obstacle to the gospel. Nothing, however, could be further from the truth. The reality is quite the opposite. In the words of Joe M. Sprinkle, a non-Adventist scholar, the moral law “is a prelude to the gospel” in the sense that it “points to Christ who is the fulfillment of the law.”—Sprinkle, Biblical Law and Its Relevance: A Christian Understanding and Ethical Application for Today of the Mosaic Regulations, quoted in Roy E. Gane, Old Testament Law for Christians: Original Context and Enduring Application (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2017), p. 4, footnote 2.

**Questions:**

1.	Share a favorite Bible text with the class. In what way has this text nourished you, strengthened your relationship with God, or protected you from false teachings?

2.	How does the moral law point to Jesus? How is Jesus the fulfillment of the law? Why is it false to says that the moral law is an obstacle to the gospel?
