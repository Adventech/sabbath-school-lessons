`Read Philippians 4:10–13, 19. What keys does Paul reveal for a contented, happy life?`

When extreme circumstances strike (hunger, illness, injury, loss), one begins to reflect on the things that really count and to dwell on the blessings that are usually taken for granted. When we are “brought low” (Phil. 4:12, ESV), “in need” (NIV), or left with “almost nothing” (NLT) is when faith rises to the occasion.

Conversely, when we “live in prosperity” (NASB), it should always be with the recognition that it could vanish in an instant (see Prov. 23:5). As both Job and Paul remind us, we brought nothing into the world when we were born, and we will take nothing with us to the grave (Job 1:21, 1 Tim. 6:7).

Note the following Bible promises:

•	Psalm 23:1—“The Lord is my shepherd; I have everything I need” (GNB).

•	Matthew 6:32—“Your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things” (NKJV).

•	1 Peter 5:7—“Give all your worries and cares to God, for he cares about you” (NLT).

•	Philippians 4:19—“My God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus” (NKJV).

And, most wonderful of all: “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me” (Phil. 4:13, NKJV). Perhaps none of us can fully grasp what “all things” entails. Certainly, as with any request for God’s help and strength, we must ask according to His will. But many times, we don’t even ask for things we know fit His will. That’s why James 4:2 says, “You do not have, because you do not ask” (ESV).

Here are some things we can ask for confidently because we know they are in harmony with God’s will:

•	Salvation for a loved one or friend (1 Tim. 2:3, 4)

•	Courage to share our faith (Rev. 22:17)

•	Forgiveness when we confess and forsake wrong (1 John 1:9)

•	Strength to obey God’s commandments (Heb. 13:20, 21)

•	Love for those who hate and mistreat us (Matt. 5:44)

•	Wisdom for challenging situations (James 1:5)

•	Understanding the truth in God’s Word (John 8:32)

`How do you deal with the things that you have prayed for that have not yet come, or perhaps might never come?`
