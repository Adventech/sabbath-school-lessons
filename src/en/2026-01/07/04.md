`Read Philippians 4:4–7. How are we to experience “the peace of God”?`

After touching on, again, the need for unity (Phil. 4:1–3), Paul moves on to another theme: rejoicing in the Lord (Phil. 4:4–7).

How many times have you been stressed over things that ultimately melted effortlessly away as quickly as they appeared? For good reason, Jesus repeatedly emphasized that we should not worry (see Matt. 6:25–34, Matt. 10:19), and Peter reminds us that we can cast all our worries or anxieties (ESV) on the Lord, “because He cares for you” (1 Pet. 5:7, ESV). In fact, the increasing problems worldwide should inspire us with hope that the coming of the Lord is near (compare Matt. 24:33, Luke 21:28, James 5:8).

The antidote to anxiety in everything, including every situation, is sending up a prayer of faith (Phil. 4:6, 7). Clearly, we are to believe and act on our prayer as having been answered even before we see its realization, because we are to pray “with thanksgiving.” Also added is the word “supplication” (Greek: deēsis), signaling times of extremity and urgency (see, for example, Luke 1:13, Phil. 1:19, 1 Tim. 5:5, James 5:16). Our prayers are still “requests,” but we can know our petitions have been received as long as we ask “according to His will” (1 John 5:14, NKJV). Then we can rest and have peace, knowing that all our requests are in God’s hands.

`How do the following passages enlarge our understanding of God’s peace? Ps. 29:11, Isa. 9:6, Luke 2:14, John 14:27, 1 Cor. 14:33.`

God’s peace is something the world can never give, because God’s peace comes from the assurance that we have the gift of eternal life through Jesus our Savior (Rom. 5:1, Rom. 6:23). This peace impacts every aspect of life and “surpasses all understanding” (Phil. 4:7, NKJV). It cannot be grasped by the mind alone, as the Greek word nous (minds) used here indicates.

`How would you describe to someone what it means to experience “the peace of God”?`
