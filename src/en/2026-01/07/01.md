### Read for This Week’s Study
Phil. 3:17–4:23, 1 Cor. 15:42–44, John 14:27, Ps. 119:165, Job 1:21, 1 Tim. 6:7.

> <p>Memory Text:</p>
> “Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God” (Philippians 4:6, NKJV).

This week’s lesson concludes our study of Philippians, and it is packed with valuable lessons and maxims for daily living. It seems that many of the high moral values that guided the apostle Paul’s life are found in the closing verses of the epistle. Similar to the teachings of Jesus, which focus on the inner person, what Paul shares with us are secrets to living a joyful Christian life.

Even when things don’t go the way we would like, which happens more often than we would like, we don’t need to be worried or anxious or discouraged. Instead, there are principles that will help us find inner strength to face the challenges that life brings, and thus we can experience a settled and lasting peace that only God can give. The present and the future are in His hands, and He will supply everything we need.

Most important, we need not place our hopes in earthly systems of government, which regularly disappoint us. As Christians, we are citizens of God’s heavenly kingdom. And with that citizenship comes privileges, wonderful privileges. And responsibilities, too.
