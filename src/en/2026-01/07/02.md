All of us have, at one time or another, found people we admire and want to emulate. For children, it’s especially important that they have good role models. Ideally, this would be their father and mother. As they grow, they will find other role models, perhaps connected with their chosen career or even in biographies they have read. They can also learn how various Bible characters dealt with challenges and compare them to their own life experiences.

Unfortunately, in today’s media, bad role models abound. We are bombarded with clickbait—stories detailing the salacious problems and messed-up lives of celebrities. Paul’s readers in Philippi, though of course not dealing with the internet, nevertheless faced similar challenges.

The fact is, the world Paul lived in was very corrupt, immoral, and evil, as is ours today. There has always been—and always will be, at least until the end—more than enough evil to go around. The question for us is: How do we respond to it?

`Read Philippians 3:17–19. How are good and bad role models described in this passage? What keys are given to distinguish between them?`

We must not miss Paul’s love toward those with whom he disagrees—he weeps over them! Notice also that he doesn’t call them his enemies but “enemies of the cross of Christ” (Phil. 3:18). Paul recognized that much larger issues were at stake, namely, how the Cross breaks down barriers and places us all on the same level, as sinners in need of a Savior (see Eph. 2:11–14).

Also, not to be overlooked is how Paul urges the Philippians to focus on the good examples, not the bad; to observe carefully those whose manner of life is much like his own. Interestingly, Paul uses similar language in warning the Romans to “note those who cause divisions and offenses, contrary to the doctrine which you learned, and avoid them” (Rom. 16:17, NKJV). The deceivers in Rome are described as those who “do not serve our Lord Jesus Christ but their own belly” (Rom. 16:18, NKJV).

`Though, of course, Jesus is the only perfect pattern, there are others who, at least in certain areas, could be good role models. At the same time, what kind of role model do you present to others?`
