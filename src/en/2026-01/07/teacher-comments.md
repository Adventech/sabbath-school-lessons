#### Part I: Overview

Key Text: Philippians 4:6

Study Focus: Phil. 3:17–4:23

Jesus and the apostles portray Christians as living simultaneously in two different realms. Jesus said, “ ‘Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s’ ” (Matt. 22:21, NKJV). Although members of human society, believers must ever bear in mind that they may already enjoy some privileges of their heavenly citizenship. More than that, they are warned to seek these benefits as a signal of their union with Christ: “If then you were raised with Christ, _seek_ those things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God” (Col. 3:1, NKJV; _emphasis added_).

As members of the heavenly commonwealth, we must “walk worthy of the calling with which” we were called (Eph. 4:1, NKJV). This calling includes living with joy and peace, regardless of the difficulties we face in our work for Christ, knowing that the heavenly city is our definite home (Heb. 13:14). By faith, Abraham “waited for the city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God” (Heb. 11:10, NKJV). There is “an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that does not fade away, reserved in heaven,” for us (1 Pet. 1:4, NKJV).

This week’s lesson emphasizes three major themes:

1.	Members of the heavenly commonwealth live with maturity, serving as models worthy to be emulated.

2.	Christian joy, like peace, is not dependent on external circumstances, for it is rooted in a close relationship with God through Christ.

3.	A joyful and contented life is possible, even in this tumultuous world, but it requires obedience to biblical principles.

#### Part II: Commentary

**Illustration**

The story is told of Dr. Thomas Lambie, who “went to Ethiopia as a medical missionary. After some time he wanted to buy land for a mission station. An Ethiopian law said that no land could be sold to foreigners. Because Dr. Lambie had great love for Christ and the Ethiopians, he gave up his American citizenship and became an Ethiopian citizen. Then he bought the properties needed for his work.”—Paul Lee Tan, Encyclopedia of 7,700 Illustrations: Signs of the Times (Garland, TX: Bible Communications, Inc., 1996), p. 1176. Likewise, believers are individuals who, because of their love for Christ, are willing to give up their earthly citizenship for the sake of the heavenly citizenship. They see themselves as “strangers and pilgrims on the earth” (Heb. 11:13, NKJV).

**Members of the Heavenly Commonwealth**

Paul suggests that Christian leaders should be patterns or examples to be copied by others (Phil. 3:17, NKJV). This notion is contrasted with the conduct of false teachers, described as “enemies of the cross of Christ” (Phil. 3:18). They are further portrayed as doomed to destruction, worshipers of their own impulses, “whose glory is in their shame—who set their mind on earthly things” (Phil. 3:19, NKJV). Conversely, Christians must be aware that their “citizenship is in heaven” (Phil. 3:20, NKJV) and live accordingly.

The Greek word translated as “example” in Philippians 3:17 is _symmimētēs_. It occurs only once in the New Testament, which suggests that Paul deliberately chose this word so as to convey a very specific and unique message. In literal translation, it means “fellow-imitator,” someone “who joins others as an imitator.”—William F. Arndt, et al., A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2000), p. 958. In fact, Paul coined this term “to stress his desire that there be a community effort in following his example: ‘Imitate me, one and all of you together!’ ”—Gerald F. Hawthorne, Philippians, Word Biblical Commentary, vol. 43 (Dallas: Word, Inc., 2004), p. 217. This notion is similar to what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 11:1: “Imitate me, just as I also imitate Christ” (NKJV). Ultimately, Christ is the perfect model for Christians. In Christ, believers can become good models for others, as Paul also indicates in 1 Thessalonians 2:14: “For you, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus” (NKJV).

As citizens of heaven, we must live with purpose, holding on to the hope that our Savior will come from heaven and transform our mortal bodies into glorious ones (Phil. 3:20, 21). Until that day comes, we must wait for Him (Phil. 3:20) and stand fast in Him (Phil. 4:1), assured that our heavenly status is far better than our earthly status.

**Joy and Peace**

Paul teaches that Christian joy and peace are not dependent on external circumstances. He makes it clear when affirming, “Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I will say, rejoice!” (Phil. 4:4, NKJV). As we know by experience, in a sin-filled world, it is impossible to live always under perfect circumstances. So, how can we rejoice always if joy is dependent on external circumstances? In fact, to experience joy always is possible only “in the Lord.” Here we see “the true basis of Christian joy and the sphere in which it thrives.”—Philippians, Word Biblical Commentary, vol. 43, p. 173.

It is important to note that the call to rejoice in the Lord is not just good advice—it is a command. Living with joy is so important for Paul that he refers to it three times throughout the letter (Phil. 3:1; Phil. 4:4, 10). As an example to his audience (Phil. 3:17), he can urge them to rejoice in the Lord (Phil. 3:1, Phil. 4:4) because he himself did the same (Phil. 1:18; Phil. 2:17, 18; Phil. 4:4). Joy is one of the major themes in Paul’s letter to the Philippians. The Greek verb _chairo_ (“to rejoice”) occurs eight times (Phil. 1:18 [two times]; Phil. 2:17, 18, 28; Phil 3:1; Phil. 4:4, 10); the verb _synchairō_ (“rejoice together”) occurs two times (Phil. 2:17, 18); and the term chara (“joy”) occurs five times (Phil. 1:4, 25; Phil. 2:2, 29, ESV; Phil. 4:1). What makes this call to joy even more remarkable is that the person who wrote it was in prison!

Christian peace, like joy, is not dependent on external circumstances. Jesus said, “ ‘Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you’ ” (John 14:27, NKJV). Again, this kind of peace is possible only in the Lord. Jesus said, “ ‘I have told you this so that you might have peace _in me_’ ” (John 16:33, NABRE, _emphasis added_). Likewise, when using the phrase “peace of God,” Paul indicates that God is the source of peace. The phrase also can mean “the peace produced by God” or “the peace that God gives.” Whatever the exact meaning is, believers can experience the peace that “surpasses all understanding” (Phil. 4:7, NKJV) only through their relationship with God. Paul would say, **the peace of God** (Phil. 4:7) is possible only because “**the God of peace** will be with you” (Phil. 4:9, NKJV; _emphasis added_). In short, how do believers who are conscious of their heavenly citizenship live? They live with joy and peace.

**Instructions for a Happy Life**

A joyful life does not happen by chance. It is necessary to follow certain principles and, for this reason, Paul provides a series of instructions in Philippians 4, many of them in the form of imperatives.

“Rejoice in the Lord always” (Phil. 4:4, NKJV). The repetition, “Again I will say, rejoice” (Phil. 4:4, NKJV), indicates that this commandment must be taken very seriously.

“Let your gentleness be known to all men” (Phil. 4:5, NKJV). “The Greek word translated as ‘gentleness’ (_epieikēs_) is an interesting, multi-faceted term. In the context of how we treat others it means to be kind and gentle, while in relationships it is to be courteous and tolerant, and in legal situations it connotes leniency.”—Grant R. Osborne, Philippians: Verse by Verse, Osborne New Testament Commentaries (Bellingham, WA: Lexham Press, 2017), p. 167.

“Be anxious for nothing” (Phil. 4:6, NKJV). This command is likely based on Jesus’ teaching, “ ‘Do not be anxious about your life’ ” (Matt. 6:25, ESV; see also Matt. 6:27, 28, 31, 34). Achieving this state doesn’t sound easy, does it? Paul hints that we can overcome anxiety by presenting our prayers, supplications, thanksgivings, and requests before God.

“Meditate on these things” (Phil. 4:8, NKJV). Paul lists a series of good things we should think on: things that are true, noble, just, pure, lovely, and of good report. He adds that these things are virtuous and praiseworthy.

“The things which you learned and received and heard and saw in me, these do” (Phil. 4:9, NKJV). In other words, follow good models!

Again, it is noteworthy that the result of following these guidelines is presented through a remarkable statement, “And the peace of God . . . will guard your hearts” (Phil. 4:7, NKJV). Only two verses later, in a near-synonym statement, Paul strongly suggests that the peace of God is possible only because “the God of peace will be with you” (Phil. 4:9, NKJV).

#### Part III: Life Application

Meditate upon the following themes. Then ask your students to answer the questions at the end of the section.

J. I. Packer rightly said, “Lack of good models always tends to lower standards, and unfortunately good models have been in short supply throughout this century.”—Packer, “Some Perspectives on Preaching,” in Preaching the Living Word (Geanies House, Scotland: Christian Focus, 1999), p. 31. God expects us, as Christians, to fill this gap (Matt. 5:13, 14). As citizens of the heavenly commonwealth, we are called to please God by “being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God” (Col. 1:10, NKJV), until the day we partake in the inheritance of the saints (Col. 1:12).

For now, we can enjoy gladness and peace, even amid the surrounding negative circumstances. Such joy and peace are possible only by means of a close relationship with God. Though there may be no peace on earth, we can find peace in Christ (John 14:27). A life of peace and joy is not the result of chance. The Bible gives us a series of instructions to help us achieve the abundant life that God intends for His children. In general terms, no other set of instructions can surpass the Ten Commandments. Ellen G. White puts it very masterfully when she says, “Our prosperity and happiness depends upon our unwavering obedience to the law of God. . . . Not one of those ten precepts can be broken without disloyalty to the God of Heaven. To keep every jot and tittle of the law is essential for our own happiness, and for the happiness of all connected with us.”—The Signs of the Times, March 3, 1881.

**Questions:**

1.	What are some of the ways that we, as Christians, can be good models today, both in our churches and in our communities?

2.	What is the connection between obedience to the law and a life of joy and peace?
