`Read Colossians 1:28, 29. What is Paul’s focus? Why do you think “everyone” (ESV) is repeated three times?`

The focus of Paul’s preaching was Christ and Him crucified (1 Cor. 1:23). According to Ephesians 5:27, the purpose of Christ’s sacrifice is “that He might present her [the church] to Himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and without blemish” (NKJV). Thus, the aim of Paul’s gospel preaching is to “present everyone mature in Christ” (Col. 1:28, ESV). He does this by teaching and warning—teaching the various points of Christian doctrine and practice (2 Thess. 2:15, 1 Tim. 4:11, 1 Tim. 5:7, Titus 1:9) and warning of the consequences for rejecting the gospel and of the dangers of false teachers (Acts 20:29–31, Rom. 16:17).

This is how we grow to be mature Christians, by accepting the teachings and heeding the warnings of Scripture. Maturity is an important concept. The parents of a newborn baby celebrate every milestone—first words, learning to walk, and learning to read. What parent would not be alarmed if their child, after several years, was still unable to walk or talk? Growth and development are normal and expected. The same is true of the Christian life.

The Greek word translated “mature” (teleios) means perfect and without defect. Through the process of Christian growth, we become keenly aware of the depth of God’s law and that its requirements are “exceedingly broad” (Ps. 119:96, NKJV). We understand it extends to “the thoughts and intents of the heart” (Heb. 4:12).

But we need to be careful, which is why Paul used the word “warning” in Colossians 1:28. The way that “seems right . . . is the way of death” (Prov. 14:12, NKJV). Spiritual discernment comes from a Spirit-guided knowledge of God’s Word. False teachings usually have some truth but either add to or take away something of what the Bible says _(see Isa. 8:20)_. The latter often succeeds, if not by directly doubting what God says, then at least by questioning whether it is really possible or whether it is applicable to our day. We must be wise as serpents but harmless as doves when it comes to discerning doctrinal truth from error.

`How do you understand what it means to be “perfect in Christ Jesus” (Col. 1:28)? How does an understanding of what Jesus accomplished for us at the cross help in knowing what it means to be “perfect in Christ Jesus”?`
