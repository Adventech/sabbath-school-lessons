`Read Colossians 1:23 (NKJV). What do you think Paul means by remaining “grounded and steadfast” in the faith? (See also Col. 2:5 and Eph. 3:17.)`

There are four different types of “if” statements in Greek, each with different nuances. The one with which Colossians 1:23 begins assumes that the condition is true. That is, Paul encourages the Colossians with the thought that they will, indeed, continue in the faith. As Paul soon indicates, he has already seen evidence of their faith and steadfastness (Col. 2:5). Nevertheless, their hope is still conditional on their persisting on the path of faith that they have entered.

This idea of persisting is the meaning of the Greek word translated “continue” (Col. 1:23, NKJV). It is used of the scribes and Pharisees who continued to demand of Jesus an answer as to what should be done with the woman caught in adultery (John 8:7); also of Peter continuing to knock at the door after Rhoda recognized his voice but left it locked and ran inside to tell the others (Acts 12:16). It is also used by Paul, who encourages Timothy to remain faithful to the doctrinal and practical instructions he has given (1 Tim. 4:16). His meaning here is similar except that it is applied to believers generally.

As we will see in next week’s lesson, Paul is concerned that the Colossians may chase after human-based ways of salvation instead of holding fast to the hope offered by the gospel (see, for example, Col. 2:8, 20–22). The word “grounded” refers to having laid a solid foundation of faith and love based on God’s Word (see Matt. 7:25, Eph. 2:20, Eph. 3:17).

Related to this idea is the Greek word translated “steadfast,” referring to an immovable structure and, by extension, to a Christian who cannot be “moved away from the hope of the gospel” (Col. 1:23). The same word is used in 1 Corinthians 15:58: “be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord” (NKJV).

Contrary to the common belief of “once saved, always saved,” Paul is saying something completely different.

`What has been your experience regarding the importance of continuing to exercise faith? That is, why must you always make a conscious choice to do that? What will happen if you don’t?`
