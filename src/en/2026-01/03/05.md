Jesus’ last prayer for His disciples was dominated by one key theme: unity. Jesus looked beyond the cross to reunion with His Father and reunion with us: “Father, I desire that they also whom You gave Me may be with Me where I am, that they may behold My glory which You have given Me” (John 17:24, NKJV). Jesus prayed that the Father would keep His children so “that they may be one as We are” (John 17:11, NKJV). He also underscored the dire consequences of disunity—it becomes a reason for many not to believe. Twice in this brief prayer, Jesus emphasizes our oneness with Him and the Father is so “that the world may believe” and so “that the world may know that You have sent Me” (John 17:21, 23, NKJV).

`Read Philippians 1:27 and compare John 17:17–19. What do both Jesus and Paul say is indispensable for unity in the church?`

The Greek word in Philippians 1:27 translated “let your conduct be worthy” is politeuomai, which means “live as a citizen”—not of any earthly kingdom but as a citizen of the heavenly kingdom. The Sermon on the Mount paints a beautiful picture of what it means to be children of the heavenly Father and members of His kingdom: poor in spirit, meek, hungering and thirsting for righteousness, merciful, pure in heart, peacemakers, turning the other cheek, loving one’s enemies, blessing those who curse us, doing good to those who hate us. In short, “to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God” (Micah 6:8).

It’s difficult to be upset or angry with someone like that, or is it? Sometimes we resent people who seem to be too good. We may even be tempted to cut them down to size or find a weak point to prove that they’re not as good as they seem, all so that we feel better about ourselves. Instead, why not see how much more loving we can be, how generous, how merciful, how humble?

Ellen G. White spoke of those who “love the world and its gain better than they love God or the truth.”—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, p. 277.

So often disunity in the church ultimately stems from pride. “As pride and worldly ambition have been cherished, the spirit of Christ has departed, and emulation, dissension, and strife have come in to distract and weaken the church.”—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, pp. 240, 241.

How crucial that we each learn the humility and meekness that Jesus modeled for us! What a different church we would have, wouldn’t we?
