In the New Testament, the terms “firstborn” and “first begotten” almost always refer to Jesus (see Luke 2:7, Rom. 8:29, Heb. 1:6, Rev. 1:5), including both occurrences in Colossians. But even when it refers to others, it does not necessarily mean the one born chronologically first. The biblical concept of the “firstborn” emphasizes the special relationship a son bears to his father, regardless of birth order. Also, there are instances of younger sons being more prominent: Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph, to name a few.

David, though the youngest of eight sons, is anointed king (1 Sam. 16:10–13), and through the psalmist God said, “I will make him My firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth” (Ps. 89:27, NKJV). He also tells Moses, “Israel is my firstborn son” (Exod. 4:22, ESV). In this sense, then, the term connotes first in terms of preeminence.

`Read Colossians 1:15–17. What reasons does Paul give for Jesus being called “the firstborn over all creation” (NKJV)?`

Clearly, Paul does not mean to suggest that Jesus was the first being created. In fact, he categorically excludes that possibility. Twice, in two different ways, he says Jesus created all things. They were created by Him and for Him (Col. 1:16). In both cases, Jesus is indicated as the personal agent through whom God carried out the process of Creation (see also Eph. 3:9, John 1:1–3, Rev. 4:11).

Paul’s statement is as comprehensive as possible. All means all—spatially (heaven and earth), ontologically (visible and invisible), and functionally (thrones, dominions, principalities, powers). The latter terms normally refer to angelic beings (see Eph. 3:10, Eph. 6:12). As if to make sure he cannot be misunderstood, Paul also indicates that Jesus existed “before all things” (Col. 1:17). The Greek expression can mean precedence in rank as well as in time, but in every other instance in Paul’s writings, it refers to time (see, for example, 1 Cor. 2:7, Gal. 1:17, Eph. 1:4).

Another reason Paul gives for Jesus’ preeminence is that “all things are held together in him” (Col. 1:17, NET). The Greek word (synistēmi) literally means “bring together” or “unite.” Jesus is the unifying factor of the universe, not only because of His role as Creator but also because He is the Redeemer.

`God, the Creator, died for us. What could our works add to that? Why is the idea that our works could add to what Christ has done already for us blasphemous?`
