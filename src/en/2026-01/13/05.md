`Read Colossians 4:14, 15 and 2 Timothy 4:10, 11. How is Luke distinguished from Demas, and why?`

The apostle John tells us, “Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him” (1 John 2:15). Luke’s love for Jesus and His kingdom led him to stand by Paul to the end, come what may, whereas Demas loved this world more than the world to come.

`Read the following passages. What counsel is given for those awaiting the Second Advent?`

1.	Mark 13:32–37

2.	Titus 2:11–14

3.	2 Pet. 3:10–14

4.	Rev. 3:17–21

Jesus and the apostles frequently warn us to “watch,” be vigilant, and be ready always for the Master’s coming so as not to be taken by surprise. Unfortunately, as did the disciples who failed to heed Jesus’ command to “watch and pray” (Mark 14:38, NKJV), many will not make the necessary preparations. It all comes down to who or what has our hearts, because we cannot serve two masters.

In the message to Laodicea, Jesus gives us a clear prescription. First, repent of our sins. Second, we are to open our hearts to Jesus and let Him be in control, which then (third) enables us to obtain the “gold” of faith and love tested by trial and victorious over temptation.

`What specifics might Jesus be asking you to repent of in your life? What part of His prescription are you in need of most?`
