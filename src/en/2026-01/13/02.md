We learn much from Paul about spreading the gospel. His travels covered an estimated 13,400 miles. This is astonishing, since much of it was on foot and some of the time he was also in prison.

Paul spent considerable time in centers of trade, such as Corinth and Ephesus, from which the message could then spread to inland towns. He also returned to churches that he had raised up in order to strengthen and encourage the new believers there. When he couldn’t visit the churches personally, he sent letters. This way, the believers knew that he remembered them and cared about them.

`Read Colossians 4:7–9; compare Ephesians 6:21. How is Tychicus described, and what reasons does Paul give for sending him and Onesimus to Colossae?`

Some things are best communicated orally rather than in writing. It would be interesting to know what news the two men conveyed to the Colossians. Judging from Paul’s intent that these things would “comfort” (NKJV) and “encourage” them (Col. 4:7–9, ESV), it probably included details about Paul’s circumstances in prison. In any event, such communication was also important as a means of maintaining the personal ties that bind believers together.

Tychicus, whose name means “fortunate,” was clearly a trusted emissary. Described as a “faithful minister” and “fellow servant,” he was one of two men from Asia selected by Paul (Acts 20:4) to accompany him on his journey with the collection for needy believers in Jerusalem. He was also with Paul during his second imprisonment in Rome, whence he was sent to Ephesus to strengthen the work there (2 Tim. 4:12). Paul also thought about sending him to Titus, in Crete (Titus 3:12). Accompanying him was Onesimus, whom Paul had converted in Rome (see Lesson 1) and describes as “faithful.”

It seems Paul also wanted to know about the circumstances of the believers in Colossae. It would not be difficult to send word back to him by someone, if not by Tychicus himself. This was another way Paul conveyed his love and concern for the believers there, even though he had not visited the church personally, and how he strengthened them in the faith so they could reach others.

`How do these personal things in Paul’s letters not only show his humanity but, in a small way, affirm the validity of his ministry?`

#### Additional Reading: Selected Quotes from Ellen G. White

We are the Lord’s family, His children, and by Him we are to be instructed in regard to what is and what will be in the future. Vigilant waiting and earnest looking are required in preparation for the solemn events soon to take place. Perfect men and women in Christ do not spend all their time in waiting, in meditation and contemplation. While we should have quiet, prayerful hours of meditation, when we leave the busy bustle and excitement to commune with God, to learn from Him His will concerning us, we are not to forget that we have a positive message of warning to bear to the world.\
Enoch walked with God, and he bore a message of warning to the inhabitants of the old world. His words and actions, his example of piety, were a continual witness in favor of the truth. In an age no more favorable to the development of a pure, holy character than is the present age, he lived a life of obedience. So filled had the earth become with impurity that the Lord washed it by a flood. He turned the world upside down, as it were, to empty it of its corruption.\
Enoch was holy because he walked with God in God’s way. In him the world had an example of what those will be who, when Christ comes, are caught up in the clouds to meet Him in the air. As Enoch was, so are we to be. Personal piety is to be blended with the most earnest and energetic warnings and appeals. We are to point to what is, with what is to be following fast after. We are instructed to be “not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord.” We are to be earnest in our efforts to clear the King’s highway, to prepare a people for the coming of the Lord. Fervency of spirit must be brought into our service for the Lord. The lamps of the soul must be kept filled and burning.\
Service for God demands the whole being—heart, mind, soul, and strength. Without reservation we are to give ourselves to God, that we may bear the image of the heavenly instead of the image of the earthly. There must be a quickening of the sensibilities, that the mind may be fully awake to the work to be done for all classes, high and low, rich and poor, learned and ignorant. We are to reveal the tenderness shown by the great Shepherd as He gathers the lambs in His arms and carefully guards His flock from harm, leading it in safe paths. Christ’s followers are to show His tenderness and sympathy, and they must also show His intensity of desire to impart the truths that mean eternal life to the receiver.—Christ Triumphant, p. 46.
