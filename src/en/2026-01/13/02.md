We learn much from Paul about spreading the gospel. His travels covered an estimated 13,400 miles. This is astonishing, since much of it was on foot and some of the time he was also in prison.

Paul spent considerable time in centers of trade, such as Corinth and Ephesus, from which the message could then spread to inland towns. He also returned to churches that he had raised up in order to strengthen and encourage the new believers there. When he couldn’t visit the churches personally, he sent letters. This way, the believers knew that he remembered them and cared about them.

`Read Colossians 4:7–9; compare Ephesians 6:21. How is Tychicus described, and what reasons does Paul give for sending him and Onesimus to Colossae?`

Some things are best communicated orally rather than in writing. It would be interesting to know what news the two men conveyed to the Colossians. Judging from Paul’s intent that these things would “comfort” (NKJV) and “encourage” them (Col. 4:7–9, ESV), it probably included details about Paul’s circumstances in prison. In any event, such communication was also important as a means of maintaining the personal ties that bind believers together.

Tychicus, whose name means “fortunate,” was clearly a trusted emissary. Described as a “faithful minister” and “fellow servant,” he was one of two men from Asia selected by Paul (Acts 20:4) to accompany him on his journey with the collection for needy believers in Jerusalem. He was also with Paul during his second imprisonment in Rome, whence he was sent to Ephesus to strengthen the work there (2 Tim. 4:12). Paul also thought about sending him to Titus, in Crete (Titus 3:12). Accompanying him was Onesimus, whom Paul had converted in Rome (see Lesson 1) and describes as “faithful.”

It seems Paul also wanted to know about the circumstances of the believers in Colossae. It would not be difficult to send word back to him by someone, if not by Tychicus himself. This was another way Paul conveyed his love and concern for the believers there, even though he had not visited the church personally, and how he strengthened them in the faith so they could reach others.

`How do these personal things in Paul’s letters not only show his humanity but, in a small way, affirm the validity of his ministry?`
