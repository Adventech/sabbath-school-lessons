Books have been written about the purpose-driven life and the purpose-driven church. While “purpose-driven” may not be quite right, a clear “purpose focus” is vital for accomplishing any meaningful endeavor. Paul’s life and ministry, as well as that of his coworkers and the other apostles, exemplify this focus (see Phil. 3:13, 14). The results speak for themselves—the gospel spread rapidly throughout the Roman Empire and beyond (Col. 1:23). The same focus is needed today.

`Read Colossians 4:12, 13. What purpose is described, and how is it to be accomplished?`

As we mentioned in an earlier lesson, Epaphras was probably instrumental in the spread of the gospel to Colossae and to the nearby cities of Laodicea and Hierapolis (see Lesson 1). His greetings and prayers for these churches were no doubt greatly encouraging to believers there. Epaphras’s prayers had a clear focus—that the Colossians would “stand perfect and complete in all the will of God” (Col. 4:12). Let’s consider more carefully the rich components of this prayer.

_Stand._ The word means to stand firm and unmoved, which is possible only by being “grounded and steadfast” in the faith and confident of the truth of the gospel (Col. 1:23, NKJV). The same word is used several times by Paul in reference to the battle against “the wiles of the devil” (Eph. 6:11) and withstanding the forces of darkness through divine power by putting on “the whole armour of God” (Eph. 6:10–18; compare 2 Tim. 2:19).

_Perfect._ The word refers to the perfection of character that finds its ultimate expression in sacrificial love (Matt. 5:44, 48) by those who will never claim to have “arrived” (Phil. 3:12–15, NIV).

_Complete_. This powerful word means to satisfy fully or bring something to full measure. It is used of Abraham’s being “fully convinced” that God would do what He promised, though humanly impossible (Rom. 4:21, NKJV), and Paul’s being strengthened by the Lord so that “the message might be preached fully” through him (2 Tim. 4:17, NKJV).

_All the will of God._ The word “all” is comprehensive. Paul himself prayed that the Colossians would be filled with a knowledge of God’s will, “live worthily of the Lord and please him in all respects” (Col. 1:9, 10, NET) through “His glorious power” (Col. 1:11, NKJV).
