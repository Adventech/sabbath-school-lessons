Timothy’s role as a co-sender of this epistle has already been mentioned (Phil. 1:1). Now Paul begins to detail how valuable Timothy is as one of his coworkers. He is described as an evangelist (2 Tim. 4:5) whom Paul had sent to Macedonia (1 Thess. 3:2; compare Acts 18:5, Acts 19:22) and, on several occasions, to Corinth (1 Cor. 4:17, 1 Cor. 16:10). Previously he had worked with Paul and Silas in Corinth (1 Thess. 1:1, 2 Thess. 1:1) and later in Ephesus (1 Tim. 1:2, 3; compare Acts 19:22). Paul describes Timothy as being “like-minded” (Phil. 2:20, NKJV). The Greek word (lit. “equal in soul”) suggests he was like Paul in many ways, including his commitment to Christ, his energetic efforts to spread the gospel, and his concern for the Philippians specifically.

`Why do you think Paul speaks so positively and at such length about Timothy here (see Phil. 2:19–23)? What else does Paul say about him (see 1 Cor. 4:17, 2 Tim. 1:5)?`

Another quality of Timothy’s mentioned by Paul is his “proven charac­ter” (Phil. 2:22, NKJV). The Greek word describes a person who has been thoroughly tested by trials (Rom. 5:4) and whose character and service has proved to be genuine (2 Cor. 2:9, 2 Cor. 9:13). Paul knows this to be true of Timothy because he has seen it demonstrated through the many occasions that they worked alongside each other in spreading the gospel.

It is the difficult experiences of life that test our mettle and demonstrate who we are on the inside. Ellen G. White puts it this way: “Life is disciplinary. . . . There will be provocations to test the temper; and it is by meeting these in a right spirit that the Christian graces are developed. If injuries and insults are meekly borne, if insulting words are responded to by gentle answers, and oppressive acts by kindness, this is evidence that the Spirit of Christ dwells in the heart.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, p. 344. She goes on to say that if “the hardships and annoyances that we are called to bear” are “well endured, they develop the Christlike in the character and distinguish the Christian from the worldling.”—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, p. 344.

`Think about the provocations, hardships, and annoyances you have faced recently. Have these been “meekly borne” and “well endured”? What can you do to enable these experiences to help make you more disciplined?`
