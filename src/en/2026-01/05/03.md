In Philippians 2:14, Paul urges the Philippians to “do all things without complaining and disputing” (NKJV). The challenges to church unity are so serious that it cannot be maintained without significant effort on our part. Unity within the church is a by-product of our union with Christ and obedience to His Word. And it’s vital to our witness, as Paul proceeds to point out, calling us to “shine as lights in the world” (Phil. 2:15).

On a moonless night, away from the glare of cities and street lights, more stars are visible, and they seem to shine much more brightly. It’s the contrast that makes the difference. The blacker the sky, the more clearly the stars stand out. It’s the same with our witness. The greater the moral darkness around us, the starker the contrast between the lives of God’s true followers and that of worldlings. How important it is, then, not to let the artificial lights of worldly ideas, pressures, and practices cause our witness to fade into the background or to disappear entirely.

`Read Philippians 2:15, 16. How does Paul describe what we, as children of God, are to be and to do?`

“Blameless” means “faultless, without reproach.” It is used especially of Job and his blameless character (see Job 1:1, 8, NKJV; Job 2:3, NKJV; see also Job 11:4; Job 33:9). The Greek word translated “harmless” literally means “unmixed, pure.” Jesus, in view of the vicious attacks that His witnesses are likely to face, encourages us to be “harmless as doves” (Matt. 10:16). Paul similarly urges us to be “simple concerning evil” (Rom. 16:19, NKJV). Our modern media channels are not known for pure, uplifting, and inspiring content. In times like these, David’s practice is a great rule for us today: “I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes” (Ps. 101:3).

We should never fear being different—our faith should increasingly set us apart. The goal is to “shine as lights in the world” (Phil. 2:15). The only way to do that is to reject conformity to this world (Rom. 12:2) by “holding fast the word of life” (Phil. 2:16, NKJV). Our choices determine whether we have lived with “the day of Christ” in view or have “run in vain” (Phil. 2:16, NKJV; compare 1 Cor. 9:24–27).

`If there are areas of your life that you would consider “worldly” (and there probably are), how can you be cleansed from them?`
