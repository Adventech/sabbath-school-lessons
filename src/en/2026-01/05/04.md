`Read Philippians 2:17; 2 Timothy 4:6; Romans 12:1, 2; and 1 Corinthians 11:1. What is Paul saying in these passages?`

Paul has already expressed a surprisingly ambivalent view toward whether he lives or dies in service to Christ (Phil. 1:20–23). Now he suggests the very real possibility of “being poured out as a drink offering” (Phil. 2:17, NKJV). This imagery is based on the ancient practice of libations, which involved pouring out a liquid (such as oil, wine, or water) as an offering to God (see, for example, Gen. 35:14, Exod. 29:40, 2 Sam. 23:15–17). The apparent “waste” of a valuable liquid in an act of devotion may remind us of Mary’s act of anointing Jesus’ head and feet with the “very costly oil of spikenard” (Mark 14:3–9, NKJV; John 12:3, NKJV). While not a drink offering per se, it clearly represented an enormous sacrifice that fittingly illustrated the infinite sacrifice of Christ for our salvation.

Should Paul be executed for his work of spreading the gospel, he would rejoice because his life was being “poured out” as an offering to God. Because libations in the Hebrew Bible generally do not stand alone but accompany a sacrifice (see Num. 15:1–10, Num. 28:1–15), Paul would consider the giving of his life as the fitting complement to the “sacrifice and service” of believers in Philippi, who, through faith, have chosen to devote their lives to God as a “living sacrifice” (Rom. 12:1).

The early Christians, including those in Philippi (Phil. 1:27–29), were active in sharing their faith. They went spreading the gospel from house to house (Acts 5:42). They opened their homes for the study of the Scriptures (Acts 12:12; 1 Cor. 16:19; Col. 4:15; Philem. 1, 2), and were able to give reasons from the Scriptures for what they believed (Acts 17:11, Acts 18:26, 1 Pet. 3:15). Our Adventist pioneers did the same. Rather than relying on pastors to spread the message to their neighbors, they shared their faith, gave Bible studies, and prepared people so they would be ready for baptism when the minister returned.

In short, at great personal sacrifice to themselves, that is, as a “living sacrifice,” they worked to spread the gospel. Should we do any less?

`Reflect on what it would mean for your life to be a “living sacrifice.” How much do you sacrifice for the kingdom of God, and what does your answer tell you about yourself?`
