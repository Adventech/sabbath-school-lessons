Philippians and Colossians are called Prison Epistles because they were written while Paul was in prison (the others are Ephesians and Philemon). Most commentators think they were written while Paul was in Rome, about a.d. 60–62 (see Acts 28:16).

`Read Ephesians 3:1 and Philemon 1. What is the significance of how Paul characterizes his imprisonment?`

Paul has given his life in service to Jesus Christ. If that service includes being a prisoner, he is ready. Paul describes himself as “an ambassador in chains” (Eph. 6:20, NKJV). He had been on missionary journeys, raising up churches and training workers for the Lord. He may have asked, “Why am I here when I could be doing so much more without these chains?” Paul was also imprisoned later, when he wrote 2 Timothy, which is considered a Pastoral Epistle. So at least five books of the New Testament were written while he was in prison.

In none of the prison epistles does Paul mention exactly where he was imprisoned; thus, some have suggested either Ephesus or Caesarea. But there is no biblical evidence that Paul was ever imprisoned in Ephesus. Caesarea might seem a more likely possibility, except there is no apparent threat to Paul’s life in this city. There definitely is that threat, however, by the time Philippians was written (see Phil. 1:20, Phil. 2:17).

This epistle gives us some other clues as to where Paul was at the time of his imprisonment. First, there was a praetorium. This can refer to a provincial governor’s official residence, like the one in Jerusalem, where Jesus was examined by Pilate (Matt. 27:27, John 18:33), and in Caesarea, where Paul was imprisoned (Acts 23:35). But Paul clearly uses this term not of a place but in reference to people. He says “the whole palace guard” became familiar with the gospel (Phil. 1:13, NKJV). In Rome, these were elite soldiers, about fourteen thousand, who protected the emperor and guarded his prisoners.

Second, Paul also sends greetings from the believers in “Caesar’s household” (Phil. 4:22). This indicates that Paul was a prisoner in Rome and in contact with those who served the imperial household.

`How do we learn to make the best of whatever tough situation we find ourselves in? Why is that not always easy to do?`
