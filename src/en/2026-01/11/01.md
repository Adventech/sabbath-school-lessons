It’s commonly urged not to be so heavenly-minded; otherwise, we’ll be of no earthly good. While true in some sense, there’s an equally important concept that Paul highlights in Colossians 3: if we are too earthly-minded, we will be of no heavenly use to the Lord.

Paul draws our attention to many practical, real-life principles that are born of heaven and can be understood only by those who are “risen with Christ” (Col. 3:1).

Paul’s counsels are very down-to-earth principles that will enhance all our relationships, and not just within the church.

Jesus said, “ ‘Love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you . . . that you may be sons of your Father in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust’ ” (Matt. 5:44, 45, NKJV).

Sound impossible? It is, humanly speaking. We need to die before we can really live for God. It’s why we must be heavenly-minded if we hope to be of any earthly use to our heavenly Father.

This week we’ll see ways in which living with Christ can make a difference, now and eternally.
