Having described the bad habits and negative qualities that are removed and put away when we come to Christ, Paul proceeds to the positive—like moving from darkness to light.

`Read Colossians 3:12–14. How are believers described, and how do you think it relates to the qualities they are to “put on”?`

Like Israel, called by God to be His special people and reflect His character, believers in Jesus are “the elect of God” (Col. 3:12, NKJV), His “chosen ones” (ESV). Not all, though, live up to this calling. As Jesus said, “ ‘Many are called, but few are chosen ’ ” (Matt. 22:14; compare Matt. 24:22, 24, 31). Paul’s references to the elect have a similar meaning (Rom. 8:33, 2 Tim. 2:10). Also, like Israel, believers are “loved” by God and “holy” (Deut. 7:6–8). This privilege carries with it an important responsibility: to “proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light” (1 Pet. 2:9, NKJV). And we do that by how we live now.

The eight qualities mentioned by Paul are quite a list! “Tender mercies, kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffering; bearing with one another, and forgiving one another,” and “above all . . . love” (Col. 3:12–14, NKJV). These can spring only from a heart united with Christ, because they describe His character and how He has dealt with us. We are to forgive others “even as Christ forgave you” (Col. 3:13). Love is “the bond of perfection” (Col. 3:14, NKJV), because it is His love toward us that binds us to Him and enables us to truly love others (1 John 4:11, 12).

These qualities impact our relationships in two ways. First, showing love, mercy, kindness, and forgiveness toward others blesses us and others. It is fulfilling to love and bless others. People will normally respond to us in kind, and we continue to receive God’s mercy and forgiveness (Matt. 5:7, Matt. 6:14). Second, and more important, it glorifies God and may encourage others to believe and follow Jesus, because it shows the power of divine grace. “No other influence that can surround the human soul has such power as the influence of an unselfish life. The strongest argument in favor of the gospel is a loving and lovable Christian.”—Ellen G. White, The Ministry of Healing, p. 470.

`How well are you representing Jesus in the way you treat others, especially those who may be unkind to you?`
