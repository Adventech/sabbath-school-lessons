`Read Colossians 3:1–4. What condition does Paul indicate is necessary for us to be heavenly-minded? What do you think that means?`

From a mountaintop, it is possible to survey a vast landscape that is all around you. From time immemorial, mountains have been frequented by those seeking a closer experience with God (see Ps. 121:1, 2). Even human-made mountains, called ziggurats, have been constructed by pagans for a similar purpose—to meet with the gods. Interestingly, the city of Ur, which Abram was called to leave, had a very large ziggurat visible from miles around. But changing one’s elevation will never by itself draw anyone closer to heaven in a spiritual sense. Human effort never could.

Instead, only through a miracle of grace, whereby we died with Christ and were raised with Him (figuratively pictured by baptism [Col. 2:12, 13]), is it possible to draw nearer to heaven.

Notice that from the beginning of Colossians 3, the repeated emphasis on what is above, that is, what there is in heaven: “those things which are above,” “where Christ is,” “things above,” “with Christ in God,” “with Him in glory” (Col. 3:1–4, NKJV).

Admittedly, there is much in the Christian life that defies explanation. How can a person really “die” and “be raised” when, to all ap­pearances, he or she is the same person and has had no such life-and-death experience? There is much that does not make sense to the natural mind, uninfluenced by the Holy Spirit. But to those who are spiritually-minded, because they have received the new heart promised by God, death to sin and being raised with Christ are genuine realities. As the hymn affirms: “You ask me how I know He lives? He lives within my heart.”

Nevertheless, Paul gives these commands because there is a constant need for this spiritual life to be renewed (see 2 Cor. 4:16). We can, indeed, fall away and be lost! And we are never safe from temptation in this life.

We must, therefore, choose daily to “seek those things which are above” (Col. 3:1). Our eternal life is safely “hidden with Christ in God” (Col. 3:3, NKJV), but the outward expression of that life will be anything but hidden.

`Where are your thoughts: usually above or usually below? If the latter, how do you change their direction?`
