Paul’s concern for peace and harmony in the church appears clearly in the last verses of Colossians 3. We’ve already looked at God’s peace in some detail (see Lesson 7). Unlike the pax Romana, the pax Christi is not a peace imposed from the outside but is to “rule” us from within. That can happen only if Christ is in control.

`Read Colossians 3:16, 17. What specifically enables Christ to be in control, and what role does music play in all this?`

The language is very descriptive. It pictures the word of Christ making its home in us. That happens when we read the Bible attentively in order to listen and learn from God’s wisdom. Apparently, though the Greek text is somewhat ambiguous, music plays an important role in “teaching and admonishing one another” (Col. 3:16).

But not just any music. Paul uses very specific terminology both here and in Ephesians 5:19: “psalms and hymns and spiritual songs.”

Though we can’t be certain, it seems a distinction is made here between the existing Old Testament collection of psalms and a growing New Testament collection of hymns. “Spiritual songs” may be a more general term for any song of praise related to the spiritual life or the life of the church. The words of the songs are the means of teaching the truth and giving instruction on living the new life of a Christian. Many great hymns of the past few centuries have powerfully uplifting messages of hope and assurance, so needed in a world that so easily drags us all down.

Music’s influence is powerful. David’s playing of the harp had a soothing effect on King Saul (1 Sam. 16:23). But when David became his rival, Saul’s anger and resentment rose (1 Sam. 18:10, 11). Calm classical music has been clinically shown to reduce anxiety, optimize brain function, increase relaxation, help with pain, and increase sociali­zation.

Who among us has not seen for themselves the powerful influence music, for good or bad, can have on our emotions and thoughts? Music—the right music—can be spiritually uplifting.

`We are told that whatever we do, “do all in the name of the Lord Jesus” (Col. 3:17). Can you truly say that you do that? If not, how can you change; that is, what must you stop doing if you cannot do it in the name of the Lord?`
