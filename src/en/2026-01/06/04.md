As yesterday’s study pointed out, the things that previously made Paul proud were actually hindrances to faith because they blinded him to his need of Christ. Paul uses the language of commerce, gain and loss, to describe his spiritual ledger prior to faith. Although we don’t like to think about it much, every human being has a “spiritual ledger.” Previously, Paul’s ledger was measured by the Jewish values of the time rather than by the biblical values as taught by Jesus.

After his conversion, his spiritual ledger looked very different because its scale of values dramatically changed, from the “currency” of Judaism to the “currency of heaven.”

“He who came down from heaven can speak of heaven, and rightly present the things which form the currency of heaven, on which he has stamped his image and superscription. He knows the danger in which those are placed whom he came to uplift from degradation, and to exalt to a place beside himself upon his throne. He points out their peril in lavishing affection upon useless and dangerous objects. He seeks to draw the mind away from the earthly to the heavenly, that we may not waste time, talent, and opportunity, upon things that are altogether vanity.”—Ellen G. White, in The Advent Review and Sabbath Herald, July 1, 1890.

In the world of first-century Judaism, Paul had been a rapidly rising star until, by becoming blind at the sight of the glorified Jesus on the Damascus road (Acts 9), his spiritual eyesight was corrected, and he saw clearly.

`John 9 tells the story of another man who was blind and then saw Jesus clearly. Jesus said He came into the world so “that those who do not see may see, and that those who see may be made blind” (John 9:39, NKJV). How might this principle be applied to your own life?`

What could be more valuable than eternal life in heaven and on the new earth? Yet worldly values blind so many to this reality. There is an inherent competition between the things valued here (see Matt. 13:22; Luke 4:5, 6; 1 John 2:16) and the things Heaven values—likeness to Christ and souls saved.

`The world can blind us to spiritual truths and to what is really important. What is the key to keeping our eyes focused on what truly matters?`
