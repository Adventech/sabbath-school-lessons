Paul’s main point must not be missed. There was a wonderful exchange that he experienced on the Damascus road, trading his old, law-based life for the presence of Christ Himself—“that I may gain Christ and be found in Him” (Phil. 3:8, 9, NKJV).

`To be found “in Him,” that is, in Christ, is an interesting expression. Read Ephesians 1:4, 2 Corinthians 5:21, Colossians 2:9, and Galatians 2:20. Based on these passages, what do you think Paul means by this idea?`

Paul’s reference to being in Christ has been widely discussed. Not surprisingly, perhaps the best explanation of it comes from Paul himself: “That in the dispensation of the fullness of the times He might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth—in Him” (Eph. 1:10, NKJV). That has been God’s purpose from the start. And Paul makes clear how that happens: “You are in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God—and righteousness and sanctification and redemption” (1 Cor. 1:30, NKJV).

Being “in Christ” comprehends everything that the plan of salvation encompasses, from the dawning of our spiritual intelligence (wisdom), to justification by faith (righteousness), to preparation for heaven (sanctification), and finally to glorification at the Second Advent (redemption). Salvation is Christ’s work from start to finish—for us and in us. Thus, by gaining Christ, we have everything we need.

`Read Philippians 3:9. What two things does Paul contrast, and why is this contrast important to always remember?`

As Paul came to realize, having one’s “own righteousness” is not real righteousness because the law cannot give life (see Gal. 3:21, 22); only Christ can, through faith. And not just any faith. After all, the devils believe and tremble (James 2:19). The only saving faith is “the faith of Christ.” Only His faith has obeyed fully and can obey. (The Greek word for faith, pistis, also means faithfulness.) So, if we are in Christ and He lives in us (Gal. 2:20), then we live by His faith through our faith in Him.
