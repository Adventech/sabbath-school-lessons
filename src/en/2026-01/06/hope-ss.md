### Confidence Only In Christ

Welcome to Hope Sabbath School—an in-depth interactive study of the Word of God. We are continuing our series on Inspired Letters from Prison. Today’s topic from Philippians: CONFIDENCE ONLY IN CHRIST.

**Scripture Song:** Rejoice always – 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18, Philippians 4:6

- **Beware of the dogs**
	- What impression do you get when you read Philippians 3:1?
	- Philippians 3:2 Who were the dogs the Philippian Christians needed to beware of?
	- Were the dogs, the evil workers, and the mutilation, three different groups or three descriptions of the same group?
	- What were these enemies of the gospel teaching?
	- Are these same enemies of the gospel active today?
	- Philippians 3:3 Why is worshiping God, rejoicing in Jesus Christ, and having no confidence in the flesh our best defense against enemies of the gospel?
- **Trust fully in Christ, not in your own accomplishments**
	- Philippians 3:4-6 What reasons did Saul (later called Paul) have to be proud from a human perspective? (see also Acts 22:3, 26:4-5)
	- What are your thoughts about Paul’s claim that before meeting Christ he was blameless concerning righteousness which is in the law?

	- What was Paul’s confession at the end of his earthly life? 2 Timothy 4:7-8
	- How can we keep our attention focused on the Jesus? Hebrews 12:1-2
