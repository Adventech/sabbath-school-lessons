An increasing number of companies around the world are working on technology that combines the processing power of computers with the human brain. In other words, by connecting minds to computers, scientists hope to impact our thoughts through the computers. Although implant use with the human brain may promise positive results, which include helping to manage epilepsy, depression, and Parkinson’s disease, more sinister uses are not difficult to imagine. Mind control cannot be far away.

In some ways, it’s already here. Our mind is like a computer, only far superior. The constant information flow, to which we are daily exposed, “programs” our mind, conditions our thoughts, and guides our actions. When we immerse ourselves in media, the worldly way people think stamps its impression on our minds, and we begin thinking the same way. It’s as if other people’s minds were implanted or melded into ours.

We are, like Jesus, to be “spiritually minded” (Rom. 8:6). “No one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God,” which Paul contrasts with “the spirit of the world” (1 Cor. 2:11, 12, NKJV). Who is our teacher? And what are we learning?

`Read Philippians 2:5. What do you think it means to have the “mind” of Christ?`

Ultimately, we can change our mind, but we can’t change our heart; only God can. The Holy Spirit needs to perform heart surgery on us, wielding the “sword of the Spirit” (Eph. 6:17), the “living and powerful” Word of God, “piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart” (Heb. 4:12, NKJV). Only through the Holy Spirit can we really know ourselves because, by nature, our own heart deceives us (Jer. 17:9). The Hebrew word for “deceitful” ('aqov) refers to bumpy ground that trips us up; by extension, it means thoughts that are tortuous, twisted, and crooked. We must be transformed by the “renewing” of our mind in order that we may “prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God” (Rom. 12:2, NKJV).

`Why is it so important that we follow what Paul tells us here: “Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy—meditate on these things” (Phil. 4:8, NKJV)?`
