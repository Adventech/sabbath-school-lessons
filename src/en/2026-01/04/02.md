`Read Philippians 2:1–3. What factors seem to have led to disunity within the church? What does Paul suggest as a remedy?`

It must have been a tremendous disappointment for Paul to see the church that he established and loved so much racked with rivalry and consumed with contention. He uses very strong language to describe the problems. “Selfish ambition” translates a word (Greek, eritheia), used earlier in Philippians 1:17 (ESV) to refer to Paul’s self-interested rivals in Rome who were bent on promoting themselves rather than advancing the cause of Christ.

“Selfish ambition” is among the works of the flesh (Gal. 5:20, NKJV), and as James indicates, “where envy and self-seeking exist, confusion and every evil thing are there” (James 3:16, NKJV). The Greek word for “conceit” is used only here in the New Testament, but appears in extrabiblical literature in the sense of arrogance, hollow pride, and having an inflated sense of oneself. Paul uses a closely related word in admonishing the Galatians: “Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another” (Gal. 5:26, NKJV).

Note the remedies Paul lists for these problems:

_1._	Consolation in Christ. Paul will proceed to use Christ’s own example as a powerful motivation.

_2._	Comfort of love. Jesus reveals divine love and commands us to “love one another as I have loved you” (John 15:12).

_3._	Fellowship of the Spirit. The presence of the Holy Spirit creates a close Christian relationship like the one that pervaded the early church (Acts 2:42; compare 2 Cor. 13:14).

_4._	Affection (or compassion). We see this divine quality frequently manifested in the life of Christ (see Matt. 9:36, Matt. 20:34, and Mark 1:41) and described in the parables of the good Samaritan (Luke 10:33) and the prodigal son (Luke 15:20).

_5._	Mercy. This quality, exemplified by Jesus, is to be seen also in the lives of His followers (Luke 6:36).

_6._	Being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind. What a picture! It is difficult to imagine how Paul could emphasize the importance of unity more strongly. As Paul will point out, the mind we are to have “was also in Christ Jesus” (Phil. 2:5).
