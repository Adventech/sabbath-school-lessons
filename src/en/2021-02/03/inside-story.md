#### Made for Mission in Mexico

_By Andrew McChesney, Adventist Mission_

Gustavo Taracena is not a pastor, but he has a passion for planting churches. Gustavo, a 58-year-old retired customer service representative for a Mexican telecommunications company, praised God when his second church plant, located in La Huasteca, a small community on the outskirts of Villahermosa, Mexico, became a full-fledged church in 10 years. But he wasn’t sure what to do next. He and his wife, Maria Hernandez, prayed. “What do You want us to do this coming year?” he prayed.

After praying for a few weeks, Gustavo learned from the district pastor about hopes to plant a church in Playas del Rosario, another small community outside the city. He prayed for three weeks and agreed to lead the project.

But where were they to meet? That problem was solved when a church member offered his house for the Sabbath meetings. He didn’t live there, so Gustavo could use the house freely. It wouldn’t cost a peso.

On the first Sabbath, two mothers and 12 children joined Gustavo and his wife for worship. Seeing so many people at the first meeting, he felt that God was blessing the project and he could move forward.

He organized a weeklong evangelistic series in the house church, and the number of children increased to 20. With so many children, Gustavo decided to conduct a special Sabbath School for children on Sabbath mornings and a worship service for both children and adults in the afternoons.

Trouble struck one of the mothers who attended every Sabbath. The owner of the house she rented threatened to evict her and her five children. “If you keep going to those meetings, you will have to leave,” the owner said.

The mother kept going to the meetings, and she was evicted. But she was not discouraged. She found a new house to rent and continued worshiping. At the house church, worshipers prayed and intermittently fasted for the mother’s former house owner. During a literature-distribution drive, the owner accepted an Adventist magazine and asked for prayer. A few weeks later, she accepted a loaf of sweet bread from a church member and asked for more prayers.

Gustavo, meanwhile, organized a second set of evangelistic meetings, this time in an Adventist church located a half mile (one kilometer) away in a neighboring community. A woman and a boy were baptized at the meetings, becoming the firstfruits of his church plant. The house church had its first two members just four months after opening. “By faith we know God will add more members and our small group will grow into a full-fledged church,” he said. Thank you for your Thirteenth Sabbath Offering three years ago that helped expand the Seventh-day Adventist Church’s Southeast Hospital in Villahermosa, Mexico.
