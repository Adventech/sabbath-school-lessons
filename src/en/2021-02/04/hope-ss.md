### Outline #4	The LORD’s Everlasting Covenant

*  YHWH (Yahweh) – the personal name of God
	* Genesis 15:7 How did God identify Himself when He spoke to Abram?
	* The name YHWH (printed as LORD in KJV and NKJV) is used 6,828 times in the Hebrew Scriptures. What is the meaning of this name God uses to identify Himself? Exodus 3:14 (see John 8:58)
	* Psalm 9:1-2,9-10 What are some reasons the Psalmist gives for praising the name of YHWH?
	* What are some reasons you have for praising the name of the LORD (YHWH) today?

*  El Shaddai – God Almighty
	* Genesis 17:1 This is the first mention of El Shaddai in the Hebrew Scriptures.  Is this another god, or another name for the one true God?
	* What is the meaning of El Shaddai and why does the LORD choose this name when identifying Himself to Abram?
	* What lessons can we learn from other occasions when the LORD identified Himself as El Shaddai? Genesis 35:9-11, Job 40:1-2
	* Share a time when you needed to remember that the LORD God, the Great I AM, is also El Shaddai.

*  From Abram to Abraham
	* Genesis 17:1-5 Why did the LORD, El Shaddai, change Abram’s name to Abraham? (“Father is exalted” to “Father of a multitude”)
	* Consider the story of another Bible character whose name was changed by God. Genesis 32:24-30
	* Identify some Bible characters whose names were changed by human powers, but they still chose to remain faithful to God. Genesis 41:45, Daniel 1:7
	* Share someone you know whose name was changed as a result of an encounter with God.

*  The LORD’s everlasting covenant with Abram/Abraham
	* Genesis 12:1-4 What important elements do you see in the LORD’s covenant with Abram?
	* Notice the LORD takes the initiative in making this covenant. What does the proactive behavior of our covenant-making LORD teach us about His character? Support your response from Scripture (e.g. John 3:16, Romans 5:8, Ephesians 2:8)
	* Genesis 17:7 How can we be certain we are included in this everlasting covenant with the LORD, God Almighty, even though we may not be physical descendants of Abraham? Galatians 3:7-9,29
	* Why is obedience to the LORD so important in the context of this covenant relationship? Genesis 18:19
