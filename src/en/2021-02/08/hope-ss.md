### Outline #8	Covenant Law

*  Chosen for a divine purpose
	* Why did the LORD choose the descendants of Abraham as His special people?
		* Not this: Deuteronomy 7:7-8
		* But this: Exodus 19:6, Isaiah 56:6-7, 60:1-3
	* As children of Abraham by faith (Galatians 3:29), what divine purpose does the LORD have for our lives today? 1 Peter 2:9, Jeremiah 31:33-34, Hebrews 10:16-17

*  Directed in paths of righteousness
	* Deuteronomy 4:13-14, 10:12-13 Why did the LORD give commandments and expect His people to obey them as part of His covenant with them?
	* Since the LORD God is righteous and holy, what should we expect from Him as He directs our paths? Psalm 23:1-3
	* What inspired confession is found at the conclusion of the longest Scripture song in the Bible? Psalm 119:172 (see also Psalm 1:2, 19:7-11)
	* When did come to realize the commandments of the LORD are a blessing rather than a burden?
	* What commandments of the LORD are most needed in our troubled world today? (Matthew 22:37-39)

*  Finding stability for our lives in a changing world
	* What assurance does the LORD give to those in a covenant relationship with Him? Malachi 3:6-7 (see also James 1:17)
	* As followers of Jesus, what assurance can we find in the inspired promise recorded in Hebrews 13:8?
	* Since our covenant-making LORD and Law Giver is the same yesterday, today, and forever, what can we expect concerning His commandments? Matthew 5:17-18
	* How would you respond to a friend who says, “The Ten Commandments are obsolete! Today we just need to allow reason and love to guide us!”

*  Choosing to enter into a covenant with the LORD
	* Read Genesis 19:19, 26:4-5, Exodus 19:5, Leviticus 26:3-8 What do all of these verses have in common?
	* How can we speak of God’s unconditional love and still recognize the need for conditions as part of our covenant relationship with Him?
	* Does our obedience to the LORD’s commandments earn His blessings or keep us connected to receive His blessings? (see Deuteronomy 5:33)
	* Share a time when the LORD blessed you as you chose to live in harmony with His commandments.
	* Why are the words of Jesus recorded in John 14:15 so relevant today? (1 John 5:1-3, Philippians 2:13)
