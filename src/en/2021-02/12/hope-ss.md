### Outline #12	Covenant Faith

*  Saved by grace through faith
	* Ephesians 2:8-10 Is this statement true only for the New Covenant, or also for the covenant the LORD made with Israel at Mt. Sinai?
	* Galatians 2:20-21 What important point is the apostle Paul making here about the way of salvation?
	* Some of us may have grown up thinking we needed to earn our way to heaven by our good behavior.  When did you come to realize salvation was a free gift of God’s grace to be received by faith?
	* Galatians 6:14 What is meant by the expression to glory or boast in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ?

*  Ransomed by the precious blood of Christ
	* 1 Peter 1:18-19 When we hear the word “ransomed” we might think of paying for the release of a hostage.  What meaning did these words convey for the readers of Peter’s epistle?
	* How does the precious blood of our Lord Jesus Christ set us free from bondage to sin and death? John 8:36, Romans 6:23 (see also Hebrews 9:22)
	* 1 John 5:11-13 The inspired testimony of the apostle John asserts that when we have the Son of God, we have life.  What is meant by the expression “to have the Son”? (see also John 3:36a)

*  Lessons on covenant faith from Abraham
	* Genesis 15:6 Explain the expression, “accounted to him, or credited to him, for righteousness.
	* Share experiences from the life of Abram/Abraham that clearly reveal his living faith in the LORD.
	* What experiences from the life of Abram/Abraham clearly reveal his imperfections and his need for God’s saving grace apart from works?
	* Romans 4:1-5 What important lesson is the apostle Paul drawing from the life of Abraham?
	* How can we be certain we have a living faith and not a dead faith? James 2:17-18, 21-22, Matthew 7:21
	* How can our faith in God grow stronger?

*  Believing and accepting the promises of God by faith
	* John 3:16-17 Some people view God as a celestial policeman, trying to find cause to accuse and punish us.  What truth is conveyed in these words of Jesus?
	* Matthew 11:28-30 Why is this promise of Jesus so precious for our lives today?
	* John 5:24-25, 11:25-26, John 14:1-3 How do you respond to these promises of Jesus?
	* What other promises of God have you claimed by faith?
