### Outline #10	The New Covenant

*  A concise description of the New Covenant
	* Jeremiah 31:31-34
	* Who is the initiator of this new covenant?
	* Whose law is written on our hearts?  What law is the LORD referring to here?
	* Where do you see a strong emphasis on relationship rather than simply a contractual agreement?
	* Why was a new covenant necessary?
	* How is this covenant different from the covenant made at Mount Sinai? How is it the same?
	* How would you respond to someone who tells you, “We are no longer expected to obey the Ten Commandments in the New Covenant”?

*  A change of heart
	* Hosea 2:16,18-20 The experience of the prophet Hosea with his wife is a painful illustration of a broken covenant. What emphasis do you see in the new covenant God promises to make with His unfaithful people?
	* Ezekiel 11:19, 18:31, 36:26-27 How does our attitude toward our covenant with the LORD change when we have a new heart? (see also John 14:15)
	* How is a new heart possible so that our faithfulness to our covenant-making God, is motivated by love and not legal obligation or fear of punishment?   Psalm 51:10-12, Matthew 7:7-11, Psalm 37:4, 2 Corinthians 4:6-7, Revelation 3:20-21

*  An inclusive covenant
	* This New Covenant is made with the house of Israel and the house of Judah.  What about the rest of the world who are not physical descendants of Abraham? Isaiah 55:6-7, Galatians 3:7-9
	* What good news is shared in the inspired testimony of the apostle Paul in Ephesians 2:11-13?
	* When did you accept the gracious and loving offer of our covenant-making God to forgive your sins and give you a new heart?

*  A better covenant established on better promises
	* Hebrews 8:6 Why is the new covenant better than the old covenant, even though the basic elements are the same? (God offers grace and we respond with loving obedience) Hebrews 9:11-15
	* How are the promises of the new covenant better than the promises made in the old covenant? Exodus 19:3-8, Jeremiah 31:33
	* There is an old Gospel song, Standing on the Promises of God.  Why is it always better to depend on the promises of God rather than our own promises?
