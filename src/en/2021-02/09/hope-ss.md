### Outline #9	The Sabbath—A Covenant Sign

*  The origin of the Sabbath
	* Exodus 31:16 Is the Sabbath simply a Jewish day of worship, given by God to the children of Israel as part of His covenant at Sinai?
	* The testimony of Jesus – Mark 2:27
	* Mark 2:28 How could Jesus claim to be Lord of the Sabbath? John 1:1-3,14, Genesis 2:1-3
	* Why did our Creator rest on the seventh day, at the end of Creation?
	* Exodus 20:8-11 What is the significance of the word “Remember” at the beginning of the 4th commandment?

*  The Sabbath reaffirmed after the Exodus
	* What supernatural signs did the LORD give to re-establish and reaffirm the importance of the Sabbath after the Exodus from Egypt? Exodus 16:1-6,23-30
	* What can we learn about how the LORD wants us to experience Sabbath rest from this story?
	* How would you respond to a friend who says, “I think Sabbath rest is a great idea, but how do we know which day the LORD blessed and made holy? (Luke 23:54-24:2)

*  The Sabbath—a covenant sign
	* Exodus 31:14-17 (see also Ezekiel 20:12,20) Why do you think the LORD chose the Sabbath as a covenant sign with the children of Israel?
	* Why was there such a severe punishment for disregarding the holiness of the Sabbath?
	* Disregarding the Sabbath still has negative consequences.  What is lost when we ignore the invitation of the LORD to rest each Sabbath day?

*  The Sabbath—a sign of relationship and sanctification
	* Exodus 31:13
	* The Sabbath is a witness of our relationship with the LORD, that we “know” Him.  Why is a personal relationship with the LORD so vital? John 17:3
	* The Sabbath is also a sign of sanctification.  What does it mean to be sanctified?

*  A day to remember in these last days of earth’s history
	* Exodus 20:8 The gift of the Sabbath is an invitation to rest in the Creator’s love and care.  How has Sabbath time impacted your relationship with the LORD?
	* Why is an earnest appeal to remember the Sabbath so important in these last days of earth’s history? Revelation 14:6-7
	* How should we relate to loved ones and friends who do not remember the Sabbath to keep it holy?
