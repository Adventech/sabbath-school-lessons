#### Farmer Plants Churches

_By andrew Mcchesney, Adventist Mission_

A Seventh-day Adventist minister asked Huang Wen-Ming, a farmer with no theological training, to help plant a church in a small village located a two-and-a-half-hour drive from his home in southern Taiwan.

Wen-Ming was surprised. He wasn’t a church member, but he worshiped every Sabbath in his own village. He agreed to help. He spoke with a church member who had a female relative in the other village, Ba-Eao, where no Adventists lived. She gave permission to start a house church in her home.

Wen-Ming and the pastor took turns preaching in the house church every Sabbath, and six people were baptized in six months. About a half year after that, Wen-Ming himself was baptized.

Adventist leaders were impressed that God had blessed Wen-Ming’s efforts in southern Taiwan, a region where the church has struggled to make inroads. The Taiwan Conference asked him to plant a church in another southern village, Santi. Six years later, that church was prospering, and Wen-Ming was asked to reopen a church in Siateya. For the first time, Wen-Ming was worried. He thought about his lack of theological training and prayed.

Two people showed up on the first Sabbath that Wen-Ming reopened the church’s doors. He encouraged the two worshipers to open their own homes to neighbors for Friday-evening programs and to invite them to attend church services the next day. After eight years, the church had 74 members.

After 17 years of planting churches, Wen-Ming said the secret is to follow Christ’s method alone, which Ellen White described this way: “Christ’s method alone will give true success in reaching the people. The Saviour mingled with men as one who desired their good. He showed His sympathy for them, ministered to their needs, and won their confidence. Then He bade them, ‘Follow Me.’ ”—The Ministry of Healing, p. 143.

Wen-Ming, 75, said he tries to meet people’s needs. At Siateya, he brought mangos, watermelons, and guavas from his farm for a fellowship meal every Sabbath. After three years, worshipers began to follow his example.

The young pastor who replaced Wen-Ming as leader at Siateya asked with astonishment, “How did you grow this church? How can I grow a church like you did?”

“Show mercy, be patient, be humble, and love others,” Wen-Ming said. “Just be like Jesus.”
