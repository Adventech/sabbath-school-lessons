### Boy Revives Dying Church

_By andrew Mcchesney, Adventist Mission_

A Seventh-day Adventist church elder asked Alejandro to preach his first evangelistic series at the age of eight. “We want to plant seeds, not to har-vest,” the elder told Alejandro’s mother.

The  church  was  dying  on  Tierra  Bomba,  an  island  off  Colombia’s  coast  in  the  Caribbean  Sea.  Its  head  elder  had  resigned  from  the  pulpit  and  left  the church on the last day of the evangelistic meetings that he was leading. Church  members  were  discouraged,  and  many  had  stopped  worshiping  on  Sabbath. 

Alejandro,  who  had  preached  since  he  was  four,  was  scared  to  speak  at  the first meeting. But Mother gave him a big hug, and they prayed together.

People packed the yard of a church member’s house to hear the boy speak. 

Hoping  to  disrupt  the  weeklong  meetings,  the  former  head  elder  orga-nized his own meetings in his home across the street from Alejandro’s site. He invited current and former church members to attend his daily meetings.

People walking to his house saw the boy speaking as they passed by and stopped. “Who is the child preacher?” they wondered. Many stayed to listen.

The  former  elder  was  upset  to  see  people  going  to  Alejandro’s  meeting,  and he marched over to demand that they come to his house.

“Come on!” he told people, grabbing them by the arm. “Let’s go!”Some  people  went  with  him,  but  when  he  wasn’t  paying  attention,  they  snuck back to listen to Alejandro preach.

This went on for several days. Then church members invited the former elder to the evangelistic meetings—and he came.

As  part  of  the  meetings,  Alejandro  visited  homes  of  people  who  had  responded to his appeals for baptism. During the first round of visitations, three people confirmed their desire for baptism. During a second round, an unmarried couple asked for baptism. Alejandro’s mother helped them com-plete the paperwork so they could be married. A total of seven people were baptized at the end of the weeklong meetings. 

Alejandro  left  Tierra  Bomba  happy.  The  church  members  also  were  happy. The church was strong and growing. 

“Jesus triumphed,” Alejandro said.

_Alejandro, a 10-year-old child preacher in Cartagena, Colombia, has led 18 people, including his parents and older brother, to baptism since he was four.
