### Outline #1	A Damaged World—What Happened?

*  A bold declaration
	* Genesis 1:1
	* Psalm 100:3, Isaiah 40:28, Acts 17:24, Hebrews 1:1-2, Genesis 1:31.
	* What major question remains unanswered by these inspired testimonies? (if all of creation was very good, why do we live in such a damaged world?)
	* Why is it important to you to know we are here as a result of God’s creative work?

*  Created in the image of the Creator
	* Genesis 1:26-27 Why did God create human beings in His image?
	* In what ways do human beings reflect the image of our Creator?
	* How does the inspired account in Genesis 2:7,18-25 help us to understand the heart of our Creator?

*  Partners in creation
	* Genesis 1:28-29 Why didn’t God create our planet fully populated?
	* What is the significance of the blessing given by God to our first parents before giving them directions to be fruitful and multiply?
	* Some of you are parents. What important lessons have you learned about our Creator through your experience as a parent?

*  The solitary test in Eden
	* Genesis 2:16-17 Why did our Creator give a single prohibition to our first parents?
	* How is this first prohibition related to the inspired account recorded in Revelation 12:7-9
	* What teaching of Jesus helps us to understand God’s intention in providing a test of loyalty in Eden? John 14:15, 23
	* How can we learn to obey God even when we don’t fully understand the reasons for His instructions?

*  The attack by a fallen angel
	* Genesis 3:1-6 Why does Satan use deception rather than clearly identifying himself as the leader of the angelic rebellion against God? (see John 8:44)
	* Why was Adam’s deliberate transgression even more significant that Eve’s act of disobedience?
	* Why do we continue in acts of willful disobedience even when we know the devastating results?
	* What hope is found in the response of our Creator and His promise recorded in Genesis 3:9,15? (see also Galatians 4:4-7)
	* Share a time when God spoke a word of hope to you.
	* What encouragement would you give to someone who needs forgiveness and hope today?
