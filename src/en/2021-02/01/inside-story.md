#### First Deaf Theology Student

_By Jose Rodrigo Martinez Patron_

My Seventh-day Adventist mother noticed that I, as a baby, did not respond to sounds in our home in Merida, Mexico. She would call my name, and I did not notice.

Mother sought help when I was about two. She sent me to a special-needs school that taught me sign language and how to speak. My teacher taught me the sounds of letters and words. I put my hand to her throat when she spoke and then tried to replicate the sound with my own throat.

My mother cried because her son couldn’t hear her voice. “Don’t worry,” the teacher said. “Have patience. Everything will work out fine.”

I attended the special-needs school for two hours every day. I also studied at an Adventist school for two hours daily. The church school taught me how to read and write, and, most important, it taught me about God.

I attended the Adventist school up to the age of eight. But the school didn’t have teachers who knew sign language, so Mother ended up sending me to a public school with teachers who could communicate with me.

The first time that I met other Adventist young people with hearing impairments was at a church-organized conference at Linda Vista Adventist University. It was wonderful to mingle with other Adventist young people with the same needs as mine. I was invited to attend the annual conference again in two years. Then the Inter-American Division organized its first special-needs conference and held the event at Montemorelos University in Monterrey, Mexico. At the conference, a desire grew in me to serve God as a pastor. But how? I could never afford the tuition.

As the conference concluded, university president Ismael Castillo made a surprising announcement. “Do any of you want to study here?” he asked. He offered a full scholarship for the tuition. I understood then that God

was calling me to be a pastor, and I stood up.

I am the first deaf theology student at Montemorelos University. This is

my second year at the university. It is difficult because no one knows sign language. I concentrate hard and try to read the teachers’ lips. I failed several classes my first year, and I have to retake those classes.

I have led several evangelistic meetings for the hearing-impaired, including in Mexico City. Churches with deaf people invite me to preach.

I have a huge desire in my heart to graduate and serve as a pastor. I dream about going to the mission field, perhaps to Spain as a missionary to the hearing-impaired.

Please pray for the hearing-impaired. We all have dreams. We are willing to do big things for the Lord.

This quarter’s Thirteenth Sabbath Offering will help open a missionary training center at Montemorelos University.
