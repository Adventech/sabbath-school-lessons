  title: "Hebrews: A Message for the End-times"
  description: "A young man sees a painting of a girl in his church for the first time. The painting touches his heart deeply. He cannot stop staring at the girl. Why? he wonders. What is so special about the girl in the painting? For a long time, the young man tries to figure out why. At last, the young man understands the reason he cannot stop staring at her: her eyes. The painting shows only the face of the girl. She looks very carefully at something that is not in the painting. But what is she staring at? Why does she look so carefully at it? For a long time after the young man sees the painting, he cannot stop thinking about the eyes of the girl."
