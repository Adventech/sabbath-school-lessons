**Evidence**: Isa. 43:1, 2

Located at the junction of a trade route, Ephesus was famous for the temple of Artemis (Diana). Paul visited this city during his second journey (Acts 18:19) and returned during his third journey and spent two years here. Aquila, Priscilla, and Apollos all ministered here (Acts 18:24–28). Believers began their Christian walk by burning all sorcery books, and the believers were blessed with responsible elders. (Acts 19:17, 19; 20:28)

Smyrna, a flourishing trade port, was located north of Ephesus. Smyrna (modern-day Izmir) was famous for culture, arts, and religion. Some of its residents, particularly Christians, suffered poverty and reproach (Rev. 2:9, 10).

Pergamum was located 40 miles (64 kilometers) north of Smyrna and 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the sea. The kingdom of Pergamon, during the Attalid dynasty, made Pergamum its capital.1

Thyatira, a small city located between Pergamos and Sardis, was famous for its purple dye.2 Lydia, mentioned in Acts 16, was from this city. Sardis, located 60 miles east of Smyrna, thought itself immune to invasion.3 Overconfidence and lack of operational security weakened the city’s ability to remain invasion-free.4

Philadelphia was built by Attalus II Philadelphus.5 Situated on the Plains of Hermus and on part of Mount Tmolus, it is known today as Ala- Shehr.6 Visitors today can see remains of walls, temples, and buildings. Laodicea, located southeast of Philadelphia, was an important banking center of the region. It was known for garments of local black wool and the seat of a medical school with a specialty in ophthalmia, which is a condition of severe inflammation of the eyes.7
