#### Run to Jesus

_By Alicia Marie Harding_

Homeschooling, a smoothly running schedule, a clean house, homemade healthy meals. These things are good, and I am passionate about them as an American missionary mother raising four missionary kids in Zambia. But these things also are simply tools that help us honor Jesus. If the tools get in the way of Jesus, we need to run to Him.

It was about 10:00 a.m. We were in the middle of homeschool, and I also was multitasking with laundry and lunch preparation. Then one child snapped at another for making too much noise. Tears started flowing when a child couldn’t figure out her math problem, and an argument erupted between two siblings insistent on getting their own way. My own frustration was festering because I had to keep repeating instructions to an inattentive child.

At that point, I knew I had two choices, I could give way to my flesh and with a harsh voice set everyone straight. Or I could go against my inclinations and with a sweet, cheerful voice invite all of us to take our problems to Jesus. What did we gain in work and school if Jesus wasn’t in our hearts?

Smiling, I called each child by name. “Shayla,” I said to my 11-year-old daughter. “Wesley,” I said, turning to my nine-year-old son. “Sienna and Winston,” I said to my seven-year-old daughter and three-year-old son. “We are going to take all our problems to Jesus and let Him help us fix them.”

We knelt under a shade tree and told Jesus about our problems. We read in the Bible about how Jesus calmed the storm. We praised Jesus with a song. Then we shared hugs and started our day all over again—with Jesus. Again.

Walking back into the house, each child’s spirit was subdued. Once inside, each child listened more carefully to my instructions. There was a willingness to work out disagreements in a respectful manner that focused on others, a sharp contrast with the earlier self-focused spirit. We were reminded that Jesus was near and His presence was more precious than any to-do list.

Ellen White writes, “Mothers who sigh for a missionary field have one at hand in their own home circle. . . . Are not the souls of her own children of as much value as the souls of the heathen? With what care and tenderness should she watch their growing minds and connect God with all their thoughts! Who can do this as well as a loving, God-fearing mother?” (_Adventist Home_, p. 245).

Motherhood is more than running a home. It’s about running your little ones to Jesus.
