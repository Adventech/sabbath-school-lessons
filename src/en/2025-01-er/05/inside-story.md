### “Do You Want Satan to Win?”

_by Andrew McChesney_

American Bible worker Joanne Park Kim locked herself in her apartment after four drunk strangers attacked her in Mongolia. Joanne wanted to go home to the United States.

After two days, another Bible worker came to see her. She thought he came to give her pity. But instead of giving her pity, the Bible worker scolded her. He said, “Joanne, did you come all the way to Mongolia to share Jesus with your closet?! Do you want Satan to win?”

Joanne didn’t expect the Bible worker to say these words to her. But Joanne needed to hear them. If the Bible worker had shown her pity, Joanne would feel sorry for herself. Then she would give up and go home. But now Joanne thought about why she came to Mongolia. At first, Joanne planned to go to Uzbekistan. So she started learning the Russian language. When the plan to go to Uzbekistan didn’t work out, Joanne ended up in Mongolia. The Mongolians used the Russian alphabet, but Joanne couldn’t understand a word of the Mongolian language. For the first two months, Joanne tried to learn Mongolian. She couldn’t share Jesus without knowing the language. Joanne also had trouble asking for help when drunken strangers attacked her almost every week. Worse, people kept thinking that Joanne was Mongolian and spoke the Mongolian language because she was Korean.

Joanne wanted to share her love for Jesus with the Mongolian people. But she felt she didn’t have much love for Mongolians left in her heart after all those drunk men attacked her.

Joanne decided to pray for help. She said, “Lord, if you want me to stay in Mongolia, please help me out of this mess. Please protect me, or show me how to take care of myself when I am in danger. Or please get rid of these drunken men.”

Joanne decided to stay in Mongolia and wait on God.

The drunken attacks didn’t stop. But God gave Joanne a tool to help her protect herself: a perfect knowledge of the Mongolian language. In just three months, Joanne learned to speak Mongolian perfectly. This was a miracle! Joanne started to give Bible studies in Mongolian. She also could ask for help when she was attacked. But after the men hurt her, she had trouble loving the Mongolian people as Jesus loved them.

This mission story offers a look inside the life of American Bible worker Joanne Park Kim. Joanne helped start the Seventh-day Adventist work in modern Mongolia. Today, Joanne continues to serve as a missionary there. You can also help Bible work in Mongolia when you give your 13th Sabbath Offering. Part of this offering will help open a center for children in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. Read more about Joanne next week.
