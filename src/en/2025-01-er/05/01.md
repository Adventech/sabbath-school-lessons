MANY PEOPLE like the idea that God is a God of love. But they get upset at the idea that God can get angry. If God is love, they think God should not get angry at all. But that idea is false. God’s anger comes from His love.

Some people believe that the Old Testament God is a God of anger and that the New Testament God is a God of love. But there is only one God. He is shown as the same God in both the Old and the New Testaments. Our loving God does get angry at evil. Evil makes God angry because God is love. Jesus showed His anger against evil. The New Testament teaches many times about God’s holy anger.

God’s anger is His loving answer to evil and to human actions and behavior that aren’t fair. God’s anger comes from His perfect love because He wants the best for all living things. Evil makes God angry and causes God to help the ones who suffer because of evil. That is why God’s anger is really another way that He shows His love.
