### Sharing the Good News with North Koreans

_by Andrew McChesney_

Seventh-day Adventists from South Korea care about their brothers and sisters in the North. They want them to accept Jesus and be saved. Jesus said, “ ‘This good news about the kingdom will be told in all the world [everywhere on earth]. The people in all countries must know about it. And then the end will come’ ” (Matthew 24:14, WE). Today, many Adventists in South Korea are praying that God will help them to share the Good News about Jesus in North Korea.

The Adventist Church’s work started in the North, in 1904, and then moved to the South. Today, the church has 235,000 members living among 52 million people in South Korea. But no one knows for sure if any Adventists live in the North. 26 million people live in North Korea. Beom Seok Oh is a leader for the Adventist Church. His job includes sharing the Good News about Jesus with people in North Korea. Beom says that God has a people in North Korea. He knows about a North Korean woman who drank a tea made from a special Chinese sauce. The tea made her very sick with a fever. The woman drank the tea every Sabbath morning, so that her boss would let her stay home instead of going to work on the Sabbath. The woman was thrown into jail. She sneaked a Bible into the prison and hid it in a hole in the ground. Then the woman dug up the Bible later so she could read it when no one watched her. Later, the woman escaped to South Korea so that she could worship God freely. Church leaders in South Korea are getting ready for the time when God will let them work in North Korea. Then the church leaders in South Korea will send Bible workers to the North.

Until then, South Korean Adventists take care of people who escape from North Korea. One church leader and his wife from South Korea often visited a man who escaped from North Korea. The man and his wife helped the North Korean man. They cleaned his apartment, cooked his meals, and helped him to become a citizen. After six months, the North Korean man accepted Jesus. Chang-Seop Lee is the pastor of the Adventist church where the church leader and his wife worship.

Another man who escaped from North Korea was worried about his wife and children in the North. The man was so upset, he couldn’t sleep at night. Pastor Lee prayed with him. The man accepted Jesus. This story caused Pastor Lee to help as many people from the North as he can.

Pastor Lee says, “Maybe we can’t go to North Korea to share the Good News now. But we can share the Good News with everyone from North Korea whom we meet today.”
