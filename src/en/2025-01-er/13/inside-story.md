### Kneeling in Front of a Statue

_by Andrew McChesney_

As an opera singer, Maria sings in front of large crowds. Maria has sung in a dozen countries. One country Maria visited was North Korea. There, she saw people bow down in front of a 72-foot tall statue of Kim Sung. Kim Il Sung was the first leader of North Korea.

Maria is a loyal Seventh-day Adventist. (Her name has been changed in the story to protect her.)

During the visit to North Korea, Maria and a group of other singers went to the Mansu Hill Grand Monument, which shows heroes from the country’s history. At the center of the monument is the very tall statue of Kim Il Sung. (A second 72-foot statue of Kim’s son, Kim Jong Il, was later added to the monument.)

A crowd stood around the statue of Kim Il Sung. Maria saw foreigners from Italy, France, and other countries. She saw North Koreans. They all bowed in front of the statue. Then Maria learned that she also was expected to bow to show respect.

A tour guide told Maria, “You must kneel down.”

Maria thought about the first commandment, which says, “ ‘You must not worship any other gods except me’ ” (Exodus 20:3, ERV). The second commandment also forbids us to bow down to any statues: “ ‘Do not make for yourself statues of gods that look like [the same as] anything in the sky. They may not look like anything on the earth or in the waters either [too]. Do not bow down to them or worship them’ ” (Exodus 20:4, 5, NIrV).

As Maria stood there, she remembered the story about Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego. These three young men refused to bow to the 90-foot tall gold statue of King Nebuchadnezzar, in Daniel 3. Maria thought, “The book of Daniel really is not a made-up story or a fairy tale! That same story happens in real life in North Korea and in other places every day.”

Maria stood straight and tall. She did not bow down.

Some people may think there’s nothing wrong with bowing down to Kim Il Sung’s statue. But Maria saw the experience as much more. During that time, Maria believed that God was asking her to take a public stand for Him.

Several days later, Maria gave a copy of Steps to Christ to her tour guide. She prays that the tour guide and all North Koreans learn about Jesus.

This quarter’s 13th Sabbath Offering will be used to share the Good News about Jesus with people in North Korea and other countries nearby. Thank you for planning to give a big offering this Sabbath.
