> <p>Memory Verse</p>
> “If we say we love God but hate any of our brothers or sisters in his family, we are liars. If we don’t love someone we have seen, how can we love God? We have never even seen him” (1 John 4:20, ERV).

We believe that God will make everything right in the end. While we wait for Jesus to come back, what we do as Christians, here and now, does matter. Yes, there are many evils that God won’t stop because of the limits on His power in the worldwide war between good and evil. But we must try to end any suffering and evil we find. Our helping people is part of our job as Christians.

As we saw already, being fair and loving can’t be separated. God loves when we are fair. If we love God, we will love to be fair, too.

Also, if we love God, we will love other people. When we love other people, we show them that we care about them and want what is best for them. When other people are suffering, hurting, hungry, or poor, we must care about their needs. We should ask ourselves what we can do, on our own and as a church, to show God’s love to other people.
