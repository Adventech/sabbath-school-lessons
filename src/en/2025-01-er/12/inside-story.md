### Stuck in the Middle East

_by Andrew McChesney_

Ki-nam left South Korea to work as a student Bible worker in the Middle East. Ki-nam came to the Middle East with a travel license or passport that allowed her to stay only for a short time. She needed another special license to stay for a full year. The manager of the apartment building where she stayed agreed to sign papers to help Ki-nam stay in the Middle East. Ki-nam needed this proof to get the new license. But then the manager refused to sign the papers. He told Ki-nam she needed to give him a lot of money first.

Ki-nam didn’t have the money. She couldn’t move to another apartment because it was hard to find apartment-building managers who would rent to foreigners.

So, Ki-nam prayed. “Lord, You sent me here. I have faith that You can solve my problem.” Ki-nam prayed every day for two months. Her parents in South Korea prayed. The leader for the student Bible workers put Ki-nam’s name on the house church’s prayer list, and the members prayed, too.

Then the day arrived when Ki-nam needed to go to the passport center to get her new travel license to stay in the Middle East for a whole year. But she didn’t have the signed papers that she needed to get the license.

Just before Ki-nam went to the passport office, the leader for the student Bible workers called her. The leader said, “I may have an answer to your problem. Let’s go.”

The leader explained that a church member knew a business owner who sold houses for a living. The church member went to talk to the business owner and asked, “Can you help my friend?”

The business owner said, “Bring her passport. I’ll give her the proof she needs.”

Ki-nam was surprised when she heard the good news. She said, “Thank You, God.”

The business owner signed the papers, and Ki-nam got her special license. After that, Ki-nam didn’t doubt that God would bless her year in the Middle East. And He did. Seven people were baptized because of her work. Ki-nam said, “God used me to save people. God never makes mistakes when He asks you to do something. He helped me every step of the way. I thank Him!”

The Seventh-day Adventist Church in South Korea sends Bible workers worldwide to help people learn about Jesus. Thank you for your 13th Sabbath Offering on March 29. Your offering will help South Korean Adventists share the Good News about Jesus at home. The student Bible worker’s name was changed in the story.
