### The Doctor Who Didn’t Give Up: Part 1

_by Andrew McChesney_

Matrona couldn’t get the Zoom call with Dr. Colette Reahl to work.

Matrona told Colette on the phone, “The Zoom call is not working!” Matrona typed and retyped the Zoom password on her computer.

Matrona was one of many Indian orphan children living in Alaska. Matrona wanted to talk with Colette, but the Zoom call didn’t work.

Colette said, “It’s OK.”

Matrona said, “It’s not OK! I want to try again.”

When the Zoom call didn’t work again, Colette suggested that they talk on the phone instead of on Zoom.

Colette Reahl was a Seventh-day Adventist and a children’s doctor. Colette was born in Florida, but she had lived in Anchorage, Alaska, for eight years with her husband. Now Colette wanted to adopt a child. So, Colette was excited about getting to know Matrona.

Matrona agreed to talk on the phone. The first question Matrona asked Colette was, “What rules do you have in your house?”

Colette said, “That is something we can talk about more when you get to the house. But respect is important in my home.”

Matrona asked Colette many questions for the next 30 minutes. At the end of the conversation, Matrona said, “Did you know that the lady who takes care of me now plans to adopt me?”

Colette did not know that. She thought, “Matrona is so interesting. She has such a big personality, too!”

Matrona knew that Colette wanted to adopt a child. But Matrona didn’t want to get hurt. So, she didn’t let Colette get too close to her heart.

Colette asked Matrona how often she could call her. Matrona said only one time each week, on Tuesdays. But when Colette called, Matrona didn’t answer or wasn’t at home. So, Colette and Matrona changed the time to Thursdays, and then to Saturdays.

Colette understood that Matrona was upset about something, but she didn’t understand why. Colette decided to keep calling every week anyway, even if Matrona didn’t want to talk to her. As Colette kept calling, Matrona started to trust that Colette really cared about her.

Dr. Colette Reahl is a leader at the Bethel (Alaska) Seventh-day Adventist Church. Last year, Bethel Church got part of a 13th Sabbath Offering. Your 13th Sabbath Offering will help us continue to share the Good News with people everywhere. Read more about Colette and Matrona next week.
