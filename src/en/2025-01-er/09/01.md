### Read for This Week’s Lesson:

Matthew 13:24–27; Genesis 1:31; Ezekiel 28:12–19; Matthew 4:1–11; John 8:44, 45.

> <p>Memory Verse</p>
> “ ‘I will make you and the woman enemies to each other. Your children and her children will be enemies. You will bite her child’s foot, but he will crush [destroy] your head’ ” (Genesis 3:15, ERV).

AN IMPORTANT BIBLE TEACHING is the worldwide war between God and Satan. This war is fought between God and the angels who sinned against Him. We may read about this idea all through the Bible (Matthew 13:24–30, 37–39; Revelation 12:7–10). This idea also is an important part of Christian history. Sad to say, many Christians today reject or pay no attention to this whole idea.

But the Bible teaches that the devil and his angels fight against God’s kingdom. We must pay attention to this important topic. If we don’t, we will not understand what the Bible stories are really all about. The books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John are filled with verses about the devil and demons who fight against God.

This week, we will use the Bible to answer two important questions:

1. Where in the Bible can you find the teaching about the worldwide war between good and evil?
2. What is this war all about?
