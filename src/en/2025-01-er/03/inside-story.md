### The Thankful Church Leader

_by Andrew McChesney_

Jong-Moon Yoon is famous for being thankful. He is a leader at a local Seventh-day Adventist church in South Korea. The first words Jong-Moon says are always “thank you!” When someone asks Jong-Moon for help, he says, “Thank you!” When Jong-Moon suffers hard times, he says, “Thank you!”

Jong-Moon carefully follows the teachings of Paul, who wrote, “Whatever happens, always be thankful. This is how God wants you to live in Christ Jesus” (1 Thessalonians 5:18, ERV). People notice Jong-Moon’s thankful spirit.

Jong-Moon owns a café on a beach in Jeongdongjin. Jeongdongjin is one of the most popular places to watch sunrises in South Korea. Many people come to Jeongdongjin to watch the sunrise on New Year’s Day. One of Jong-Moon’s customers was Nanum. When she was a teenager, Nanum sometimes came to the café to enjoy the sunrise while she ate breakfast. Later, Nanum got married and had a daughter named Azsa. Nanum and her daughter often came to Jong-Moon’s café for breakfast. Nanum was always amazed at Jong-Moon’s thankful spirit. When Nanum ordered her food, Jong-Moon said, “Thank you!” When Nanum paid for breakfast, Jong-Moon said, “Thank you!” When Nanum thanked Jong-Moon for a meal, he said, “Thank you!”

During a visit, Nanum had a conversation with Jong-Moon. She learned that he went to church on Saturdays. Nanum never heard about people worshiping on Saturdays. Nanum asked Jong-Moon, “May I go to church with you next Saturday?”

The next Sabbath, Nanum and her five-year-old daughter went with Jong-Moon to his church. The church was a 30-minute drive from Jong-Moon’s café. Church members warmly welcomed Nanum and her daughter. They wanted to know how Nanum learned about the church. Nanum said she came because of the “thankful church leader.”

After church, Nanum told Jong-Moon that she wanted to come again. She said, “If you go to this church, I will follow you.”

Nanum never heard Jong-Moon say the name of Jesus at the café. But she saw that Jesus lived in Jong-Moon’s heart. We preach the Good News about Jesus with more than our words. We preach the Good News in the way we live our lives. Jong-Moon’s example helped a young mother and her daughter to start to go to church every Sabbath. Now, Nanum is praying that her husband will join them on Sabbath mornings.

Part of this quarter’s 13th Sabbath Offering will help Bible workers share the Good News about Jesus in South Korea. Thank you for planning to give a big offering on March 29.
