### Drunken Men Attack a Bible Worker

_by Andrew McChesney_

A drunken man approached a 21-year-old Bible worker on a public bus. Then the man tried to hug and kiss her. The young Bible worker tried to stop him. The other passengers on the bus looked the other way until an old woman yelled something to the bus driver. The bus stopped. Then the old woman told some of the passengers to help the young woman. The passengers threw the man off the bus. The old woman came over to the Bible worker, who was crying, and patted her arm.

The young woman was Joanne Park Kim. Joanne had this same experience nearly every week in Mongolia. The time was the 1990s. Joanne was a single American woman. She served as one of the first Seventh-day Adventist Bible workers in Mongolia. Mongolia was a very poor country.

Another time, a drunk neighbor thought Joanne’s apartment was his own. The man kicked down her wooden door with his steel-tip boots. Then the man started to beat Joanne. Joanne grabbed a broom and screamed. She fought back. Joanne was losing the fight until she used the broom to bang on the ceiling. A married American couple lived in the apartment above Joanne. They heard the banging and came down to help her.

The worst experience for Joanne happened when she and another Bible worker waited for a friend at a bus stop in Ulaanbaatar. Ulaanbaatar is Mongolia’s capital. Earlier, a mother invited Joanne and her friend to her child’s first haircut, which was a time for celebration in Mongolia. The mother told Joanne and her friend to wait for her at the bus stop.

Then four drunken men sat next to Joanne and her friend and tried to hug and kiss them. Joanne and the other girl tried to move away, but the men followed. Everyone at the crowded bus stop looked away. They pretended not to notice the men. The men dragged the women to an empty street behind some buildings. Joanne screamed, kicked, and fought back. But she was no match for the four men. The men threw the women on the ground. Joanne thought that the men were going to force them to have sex.

Then the men’s faces filled with fear. The men turned and ran away. Joanne looked around to see who saved them. No one was there. Joanne knew the men saw an angel.

This story offers a look inside the life of American Bible worker Joanne Park Kim. Joanne helped start the Seventh-day Adventist work in modern Mongolia. Today, Joanne continues to serve as a missionary there. You can also help Bible workers in Mongolia when you give your 13th Sabbath Offering. Part of this offering will help open a center for children in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. Read more about Joanne next week.
