> <p>Memory Verse</p>
> “But the Lord says, ‘Can a woman forget her baby? Can she forget the child who came from her body? Even [anyway] if she can forget her children, I cannot forget you’ ” (Isaiah 49:15, ERV).

Some people believe that strong feelings are bad. So, they try to avoid having strong feelings whenever they can. Because some people believe that strong feelings are bad, they think that good people do not have strong feelings. Some Greek thinkers believed that the best person was someone who didn’t feel any strong feelings or was someone who controlled his feelings.

Yes, some strong feelings that get out of control can be a problem. But God made us with hearts to feel. The Bible shows God as Someone who has strong feelings. If God has strong feelings, then strong feelings can’t be bad. That’s because God is good, perfect, and wise.

God loves us deeply. When we understand this idea about God’s love, we can learn some beautiful Bible truths. But we always must remember that God’s love is not the same as our love. Our love is human. But God’s love is perfect.
