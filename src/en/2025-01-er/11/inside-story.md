### The Doctor Who Didn’t Give Up: Part 3

_by Andrew McChesney_

Dr. Colette Reahl hoped to bring Matrona home before the Sabbath started. Matrona was a 13-year-old Indian girl who was born in Alaska. Colette told Matrona that she was a Seventh-day Adventist. Colette wanted to get Matrona settled into her new home in Anchorage before they spent their first Sabbath together.

But the managers for the adoption center had other plans. The managers told Colette that she could take Matrona home on the Sabbath.

The day before the big move, Colette called Matrona at the adoption center in Anchorage. Colette said, “I go to church each Sabbath. Would you like to go with me?”

Matrona said, “No.”

When Matrona arrived to see Colette the next morning, Matrona announced that she wanted to watch TV.

Colette said, “On Sabbaths in my house we watch Christian shows or nature programs.”

Matrona was surprised. So, she asked if she could watch a TV show about wild animals.

Colette and Matrona spent the next two months in Anchorage getting to know each other. Then Matrona and Colette moved to Bethel, where Colette had a new job at a hospital. Colette and Matrona built a strong relationship during this time. They had morning and evening worship together. Matrona became a very spiritual person.

Today, Matrona is 15 years old. She loves living in Bethel, Alaska, where she is homeschooled, takes piano lessons, and has many friends. Church is also very important to Matrona.

Colette said, “God brought Matrona and me together.” Colette also serves as a Bible worker and is a leader in the church.

Colette also said, “The Matrona I met on the phone is very different from the Matrona now. Matrona is a leader for the kids at church and in the community. I see God working in her life and helping her faith grow strong.”

Matrona is thankful that Colette didn’t stop calling her. Matrona also is thankful for Colette’s love as a mother. Matrona said, “I know who God is because Colette never gave up on getting to know me.”

Matrona said that God used Colette to change her life. “God led Colette to me, and me to her. God brought me to a good place and gave me peace.”
