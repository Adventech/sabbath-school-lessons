### The Doctor Who Didn’t Give Up: Part 2

_by Andrew McChesney_

Dr. Colette Reahl thought that Matrona looked as tall as a giant! Matrona was a 13-year-old Indian girl from Alaska.

Four months ago, Colette talked with Matrona for the first time on the phone. Now Colette drove seven hours from Anchorage, Alaska, to Fairbanks, Alaska, to meet Matrona in person. Matrona lived at a center with 19 other girls and boys. Matrona was 5 foot 7 inches. Colette was only 5 foot 3 inches.

When Colette saw the girl, she thought, “Matrona looks the same as a giant to me. Our meeting will be interesting!”

Matrona sat on the floor in a meeting room. Matrona was shy and didn’t want to talk at first.

Colette sat down on a couch near Matrona. A few minutes passed. Then Colette remembered the gift she brought for Matrona. The gift was an encyclopedia about animals. Colette opened the book and slowly started to turn the pages. Matrona was very interested in the book. She moved closer to Colette. Before long, Matrona sat right beside Colette and looked at the pictures with her.

Colette and Matrona had a pleasant first visit. Their visit was three hours long.

Colette and Matrona met again the next month. Colette gave Matrona a Bible. Colette suggested that they read the Bible together over the phone. But when Colette called, Matrona was too busy to talk on the phone.

Then Matrona moved to a new center in Anchorage. Matrona was lonely and missed her friends in Fairbanks. So, Matrona started to call Colette every day to try to get Colette to adopt her.

Meanwhile, Colette started a new job. Colette’s work as a doctor in Anchorage was ending. She got ready to move to Bethel, the biggest community in the west of Alaska, with 6,000 people. Colette would work at a hospital there.

Matrona wasn’t excited about the news that Colette was moving to Bethel. To Matrona, Bethel was a small village. Matrona thought that life in Bethel would be very boring.
