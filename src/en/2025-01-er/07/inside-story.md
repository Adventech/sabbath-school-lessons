### A Voice in the Dark

_by Andrew McChesney_

An angry voice woke up Grace Babcock in the middle of the night. The voice said, “You don’t know. You don’t understand.”

Grace was upset about being woken up, but she wasn’t scared. Grace worked as a teacher at the Holbrook Indian School.

The voice told Grace, “God is controlling you the same as a puppet. You don’t understand many things. You follow God blindly. God is not fair.”

Grace was trying to trust God after a bus hit and killed a student. Grace had many questions for God. But she was feeling upset about the student’s death. So, she didn’t want to talk with God about her questions.

Now the voice was accusing God, and Grace didn’t like that.

Grace said, “Go away. I don’t want to talk to you.”

The voice stopped talking.

But Grace remembered the bad things the voice said against God. Grace didn’t want to talk to God right now. But she felt she needed to be fair. So, Grace asked God about the things that the voice said. But God said nothing. So, Grace fell asleep.

The next day, Grace went to a spot in nature where she often liked to think. She sat down on a rock. Then she asked God again about the things that the voice said against Him. God stayed silent. Grace went home just before night came.

Grace went to the same place the next day. Again, God was silent when she asked Him her questions. But as she walked home, she heard a voice in her heart say, “You don’t need to know the answers to these questions. You need to trust and believe.”

Grace said, “That’s true. I don’t need to know the answers. But I do need to know that You are loving and holy, Lord. Right now, I don’t know if You are loving and holy.”

Back home in her one-bedroom apartment, Grace opened the Adult Sabbath School Bible Study Guide and started to read. As she read, she heard a voice in her heart say, “Look up.”

When Grace looked up, she saw a picture from a coloring book on her refrigerator. A fifth-grade student gave the picture to Grace. The picture showed Jesus’ cross with the words from John 3:16. Grace said, “You died for us, Jesus. Because You did that, You really are loving. I can trust You, even if I don’t have answers to all my questions.”
