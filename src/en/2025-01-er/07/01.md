> <p>Memory Verse</p>
> “ ‘He will wipe every tear from their eyes. No one will die. No one will ever cry or be sad for any reason. No one will ever have trouble. The old things are gone’ ” (Revelation 21:4, WE).

Maybe the biggest problem for Christians is the problem with evil. If God is all-good and all-powerful, why is there so much evil?

This question troubles many people and keeps some of them from coming to know and love God.

“Many people are troubled with the problem of sin. How did sin start? Why is sin on this earth? People see the evil in life and that it is very terrible. So, some people question how a loving, powerful, and wise God can allow there to be evil. People can find no explanation for this mystery.”—Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy, page 492, adapted.

Many people say the reason they don’t believe in God is because of the problem with evil. But as we will see this week and in coming weeks, the God of the Bible is holy and fair. We can trust Him, even when evil is everywhere around us.
