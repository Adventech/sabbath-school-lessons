### “You Must Help This Man”

_by Andrew McChesney_

American Bible worker Joanne Park Kim walked to her rented apartment in Ulaanbataar, Mongolia. It was winter. The midafternoon temperature was about –40 degrees.

Joanne saw a drunk man lying on the sidewalk. Some drunken men hurt Joanne over the past year. So, Joanne didn’t want to stop to help this drunk man. What if the man also attacked her? Joanne started to walk past him, but then she stopped. A voice inside her heart said, “You must help this man.”

Joanne didn’t want to help the man. She prayed, “Lord, this man weighs almost two times as much as I do. How can I help him?”

Joanne looked around. The street was empty. Joanne didn’t see anyone else. She looked at the stranger again. She thought, “If I don’t help him, he will die. His body will freeze in a couple of hours.”

Joanne saw apartment buildings all around. Each building had a small room on the first floor for a guard, so the entrance was warm. The nearest building was about 1,000 feet away. Joanne prayed, “OK, Lord. I’ll do my best to get this guy over there. Please help me.” Joanne put her arms under the man’s. She prayed for strength and pulled. Somehow, she dragged the man to the building. She put him in the warm doorway. Then she stepped back and looked at him. New feelings filled Joanne’s heart. She felt love and pity.

This experience helped change Joanne. She no longer felt anger and hate for the men who hurt her in the past. Now, mercy and pity filled her heart. Finally, she loved the Mongolian people the same as Jesus loved them.

Later, Joanne helped start the first Seventh-day Adventist church in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. Joanne worked as a Bible worker there from 1992 to 1998. She was one of the first Bible workers to serve in modern-day Mongolia. In 2017, Joanne went back to Mongolia. She now serves as the education manager for the Adventist Church in Mongolia.

Even now, drunken strangers try to hurt Joanne from time to time. But Joanne’s love for God and His people is strong. Joanne says, “Satan doesn’t give up. He knew he could make me afraid enough so that I would want to quit. But God gave me the knowledge of how to speak the Mongolian language. God also gave me a new heart. God loves even the drunk men who hurt me all the time. So, I need to love these men, too, and help the Mongolian people as best as I can.”

You can help, too. When you give your 13th Sabbath Offering this quarter, your money will be used to help open a center for children in Ulaanbaataar, Mongolia.
