  title: "Our Fair and Loving God"
  description: "God is love. So we read in 1 John 4:8 and 16. The whole Bible tells us that God is love. God’s love is the beginning of the Christian faith. Love is who God is. Love is part of everything we believe and do. If we believe that God’s love must be earned, we may think that God doesn’t love us because we are filled with sin and are not worthy. This thinking is a mistake."
