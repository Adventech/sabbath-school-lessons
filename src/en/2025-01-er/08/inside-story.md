### From a Dance Party to Church

_by Andrew McChesney_

Nelson was born in Colombia. As a young boy, Nelson was too young to go to rumba. Rumba was a party with music, dancing, and drinking. Nelson knew something was wrong when his parents took him to church on December 31 and then left him home so they could celebrate New Year’s Eve at a rumba party.

In Colombia, Christians went to church on New Year’s Eve Day to give their lives to God. Then they went to rumba to celebrate the New Year. Yes, Nelson was a little boy, but he understood that church was a holy place. But rumba was not holy because people celebrated it in bars and nightclubs. Nelson wondered, “Why does my family go to church to become holy and then go to rumba to remove God from their hearts?”

Nelson asked his mother, “Why do you go to church and then to rumba?”

Nelson’s mother didn’t answer.

When Nelson grew up, he stopped going to church. He started to play music at rumba parties. Nelson was an excellent accordion player. He wanted to become a famous musician.

Then Nelson met his future wife, Laura. Laura used to be a Seventh-day Adventist.

Laura told Nelson, “Did you know that the dead are not in heaven?” Nelson didn’t like Laura’s ideas. But he liked her. So, they stayed together.

After some time, Laura started to go to church again. She also invited Nelson to meet her parents. At their first meeting, Laura’s dad surprised Nelson when they sat down to eat. Laura’s dad said, “Let’s thank God for the food.” Nelson never prayed before he ate a meal. Nelson became friends with Laura’s dad. Soon, Nelson started to pray before he ate. Nelson also started to go to church with Laura. Nelson didn’t enjoy church at first because he thought it was strange to worship at church on Saturdays. But then Nelson read the fourth commandment, in Exodus 20:8–11. Nelson understood that God commanded people to keep the 7th day holy. Nelson wanted to be holy.

Today, Nelson Silva, 30, is an Adventist musician who no longer plays the accordion at rumba. Now, Nelson plays in restaurants and at birthday parties. Nelson tells people about God’s mercy and prays for them. He and a group of church musicians play music on public buses.

Pray for the Good News to be shared with people everywhere. Thank you for your offerings that help us share the Good News with people who don’t know about Jesus. Watch a YouTube video of Nelson playing the accordion at: www.bit.ly/Nelson-Silva.
