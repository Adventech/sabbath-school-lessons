### Dirt, Not Corn

Melvin wasn’t sure what to believe: Did God make man from dirt or from corn? The Bible taught that “the Lord God took dust from the ground and formed [made] man from it. The Lord breathed the breath of life into the man’s nose. And the man became a living person” (Genesis 2:7, ICB). Melvin was from a group of people named the Cabécar. There are about 17,000 Cabécar in Costa Rica. The Cabécar taught Melvin that Sibú made humans from corn. Sibú is the word for “God” in the Cabécar language.

Growing up, Melvin always thought that the Sibú of the Cabécar people was the same as the Sibú of the Bible. Then Melvin studied the Bible with a Seventh-day Adventist. Melvin understood that the Bible taught very different ideas about God than he learned from his people. Melvin decided to accept what the Bible taught about Sibú. Melvin was baptized with his parents and two other family members.

A year later, Melvin’s mother died at the age of 40.

Melvin was 22 at the time. He believed the Bible teaching about what happens when you die: a person sleeps until Jesus comes back. But the Cabécar people believed that Melvin’s mother was alive. Worse, she would be lost in the dark forever if her family didn’t help lead her into the next life in a special funeral ceremony that continued for four days. Melvin’s family also needed to kill two pigs and three chickens and feed them to the guests who came to the funeral. If Melvin’s family refused to kill the animals, everyone would think they were selfish. Melvin’s grandparents and other family members wanted Melvin and his family to follow the Cabécar teachings. But Melvin and his family decided to follow the Bible. An Adventist pastor helped them to find a place to bury his mother outside of Cabécar land.

At this time, Melvin chose to become a pastor. After his mother died, Melvin decided to spend the rest of his life telling the Cabécar about the real Sibú in the Bible. Melvin wanted to help his people know Bible truth about the Sibú who made humans from dirt, not corn. Melvin also wanted his people to know that they didn’t need to kill animals to get everlasting life.

Today, Melvin Madriz is a 24-year-old student at an Adventist university in Costa Rica. There, Melvin studies to be a pastor. Melvin will be the Adventist Church’s first Cabécar pastor. Only about 30 Cabécar people are Adventist.

Melvin says, “I believe only in Sibú from the Bible.”

Pray for the Cabécar people to learn about the God of the Bible and for all people worldwide who don’t know about Jesus. Thank you for your offerings that help Bible workers share the Good News with these people groups.
