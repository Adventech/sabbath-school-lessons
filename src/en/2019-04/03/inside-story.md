### Japanese Pastor Finds 30,000

_By Andrew Mcchesney, Adventist Mission_

The large water bill shocked Japanese church leaders in Tokyo. Astonished that the bill had doubled from the previous month, leaders of the Amanuma Seventh-day Adventist Church contacted the water company and soon learned that an underground pipe had burst and was spewing water. The water pipe could not be repaired, and the water company advised the church to install an aboveground water pipe. The cost: 7 million yen, or about US 70,000.

Moreover, church leaders faced another major expense. They needed to raise 16 million yen (US 160,000) to purchase equipment so their church could be one of 161 sites across Japan participating in the 2018 evangelistic meetings.

Complicating matters, church members weren’t enthusiastic about the evan gelistic meetings, complaining that the expense and work were too much. “It was very stressful,” said Kyoichi Miyazaki, the first elder of the Amanuma church.

The church board met to pray about the water pipe. Immediately after the prayer, the church’s associate pastor, Myunghoon Rha, went to his office. On the desk he found 3 million yen (US 30,000) in cash.

Rha, a missionary from South Korea, was thrilled, and he excitedly broke the news to the other church board members. The next Sabbath, he announced the need for the water pipe to the congregation. He told how the 3 million yen had appeared in his office, and he appealed for more contributions.

A short time later, a surprise appeared in the Sabbath School offering plate: an envelope containing 1 million yen (US 10,000).

Church leaders were delighted, but they worried that perhaps the giver hadn’t fully understood his or her actions. In the moments after the offering was col lected and counted, they determined that the money had been given by a first time visitor, and they pulled her aside. “Did you really intend to give this much money?” they asked her.

“I had a dream last night,” she said. “In the dream, someone told me to make a donation to a Christian church. I’m not a Christian, and I don’t know any Christian churches. So, I looked for a Christian church, and I found you.”

She insisted that the church keep the 1 million yen.

After that Sabbath, the woman was never seen again. The church also never learned the source of the 3-million-yen donation. Through such miracles, the church managed to raise the funds for the new water pipe—and for the equipment for the evangelistic meet ings. Rha said the miraculous donations and baptisms have helped change the atmosphere at the Amanuma church, the largest Adventist church in Japan, with 900 members.

“People were negative, but now they are enthusiastic,” said Rha, left. “They know God is alive.”
