### Part I: Overview

**Key Texts**: Ezra 7:10, 27; Romans 8:28

**Study Focus**: Ezra 7, Daniel 8:14, Daniel 9:24–27

God calls Ezra and Nehemiah for a specific task: to rebuild the walls and gates of Jerusalem. But most important, God calls these men to “rebuild” the remnant of God’s people in order that they should once again function as missionaries to the world. Ezra responds to God’s call to be a teacher of His Word. In company with a group of returnees, he journeys to Jerusalem in order to teach the people about God. There Ezra prepares the people  to do the work of restoring Jerusalem. Spiritual revival always precedes the reformation of life; decisive actions are the natural outgrowth of such revival. Thus, Ezra pours himself into educating the people about who God is in an effort to inspire them to fully walk with Him.

When Nehemiah, a man of action, comes on the scene, God calls him to specifically rebuild the physical structures of Jerusalem, to  inspire the people to stand for justice, to trust in God’s protection, and to bring about reform in the civil life of the nation (justice and care for the less fortunate are a priority for Nehemiah). He demonstrates what the life of a Christian, living every day for God, looks like.

Additionally, this lesson confirms the decree from Artaxerxes, in Ezra 7, as the starting date for the 2,300 day/year prophecy of Daniel 8:14  and for the 70-week prophecy in Daniel 9:24–27. God’s election, in the context of Romans 8 and 9, also is discussed.

### Part II: Commentary

**Prophetic Time Period**

God calls Ezra at the beginning of the 70-week prophetic period, outlined in Daniel 9:24–27. The onset of this prophetic period corresponds with Artaxerxes’s command to restore the city of Jerusalem in the year 457 b.c. This week’s lesson explains in detail what that prophetic period meant and how it corresponds with the 2,300-year prophecy. Through prophecy, God especially demonstrates that He is in charge of events and watches over our world. Moreover, God sets a prophet or leader over His people during the beginning of each prophetic period or time of crisis in Israel and some one over the end of each period, as well. For example, Moses comes at the time of the Exodus, while Joshua comes at the end of Israel’s wilderness sojourn as God’s people enter the Promised Land. The following outline demonstrates that prophets were called at a crucial time in salvation his tory, corresponding to the beginning and ending of a prophetic period:

- Noah—commissioned to serve God before the Flood.
- Abraham—called out to be the father of God’s people.
- Moses—leads God’s people during the Exodus to the borders of the Promised Land.
- Joshua—ushers God’s people into the Promised Land.
- Samuel—judges during the beginning of the monarchal period.
- Hosea and Amos—prophesy before the fall of the northern kingdom and Samaria in 722 b.c.
- Ezekiel and Daniel—enter their prophetic ministry during the Babylonian exile.
- Haggai and Zechariah—serve after the return from exile.
- Ezra and Nehemiah—commence serving God at the beginning of 2,300 day/year prophecy (457 b.c.).
- John the Baptist—calls Israel to repentance prior to the onset of Jesus’ ministry.
- Stephen—witnesses, after which the gospel went to the Gentiles (at the time in which the 70-week prophecy ends, in a.d. 34).
- Ellen G. White—called at end of 2,300 day/year prophecy (1844).

So one can detect from this outline a pattern of God’s working plan.  In God’s plan of redemption, there are expressed specific prophetic time markers. Whenever there is a spiritual crisis, God sends His prophets, who fulfill His mission by calling people back to God and to obedience to His Word.

**Personal Timing**

Election also may be the calling to fulfill a specific task such as is the case for Ezra and Nehemiah (and many other of God’s  servants; see Exodus 3:9–12; Isaiah 6:7, 8; and Jeremiah 1:5–9). In the same way, we are called to reflect the character of Jesus and do something definite for God. It may be a job that we perform for Him; an action He impresses us to do, such as helping someone; or a specific career that lasts a lifetime. Each of the leaders mentioned above  was  specifically  chosen  by God for “such a time as this” (Esther 4:14). They called for action, repentance, and a deep commitment to God. Ezra and Nehemiah had a role to play as leaders of God’s people at the beginning of the longest prophetic time period. They also exhorted the people to live for God and to demonstrate their commitment through faith and action. The people returned from Babylon steeped in the Babylonian way of life and the  worship of many deities. Fortunately, despite whatever other problems challenged them in their post-exilic life, idolatry was not one of them. Nonetheless, their past religious pluralism was not without its deleteri ous effects. Even though the Jewish community no longer worshiped idols, their former idolatry made it necessary for Ezra and Nehemiah to teach the people again what it meant to worship the God of heaven and to live for Him. Their apparently harsh way of approaching situations (such as intermarriage in the later chapters of  Ezra  and  Nehemiah)  should not surprise us because both leaders wanted to teach the people what it meant to live holy lives and to radically change their ungodly lifestyles. Thus, both Ezra and Nehemiah called for unreserved commitment to Yahweh, total reform, and passionate service to God.

**Called to Restore: A Collaboration**

Nehemiah arrived in Jerusalem (445/444 b.c.) some 13 years after Ezra’s group. But Nehemiah’s mission of rebuilding Jerusalem would not have been as successful without the work  of Ezra. Ezra was busy teaching   the people about God. In other words, God was using Ezra to spiritually “build up” people so that the people could “build” physical structures once Nehemiah arrived. God was working in the background, preparing the hearts of the people and the two leaders. Ultimately, God wanted not only a restored Jerusalem; He also wanted a restored people who belonged to Him. Therefore, Ezra and Nehemiah’s foremost job was to bring the people back to God. They not only inspired the people for the work to be done on the ruins, but most important, they inspired the people to discover a passion for God. Ezra and Nehemiah modeled that passion in their own lives through prayer, fasting, seeking God, and acting in accordance with God’s Word.

Both Ezra and Nehemiah were chosen for a specific task during a stra tegic time in history. They were called as leaders, each in his own unique way, based on their talents. Ezra was a priest and a scribe, and thus his main influence was through teachings of the Torah. Nehemiah, on the other hand, was a cupbearer to the king and had incredible leadership abilities to motivate and rally people to get a job done. Ezra was a teacher; Nehemiah was a doer.  Both were leaders and yet led in different ways.  At the same time, both of their leadership styles were important for the mission at hand. They complemented each other and cooperated in order to make a difference for God. God used their varied personalities and pas sions to bring about a change in the nation.

Ultimately, we are responsible for what we do with the task or posi tion God gives us. The decision of whether our task is completed with excellence or mediocrity falls on us. God will help us every step of the way; however, He will not do for us the work He has given us to do. We may have every gift under the sun, but if we are not using them for God, they are useless. We each have to decide to put our all into everything God calls us to do in spite of opposition. Ezra and Nehemiah could have given up, but they did not. They persevered because they fixed their eyes on God. The importance of their call outweighed their fear of negative consequences that arose from standing for the Lord. They were sure that their mission was worth it.

**Predestination**

God called, or predestined, His people, the nation of Israel, to be a light to the world. Paul deals with that call in Romans 9–11 in view of the   fact that Israel’s leaders did not accept Jesus Christ as their Messiah and Savior. However, God’s call did not change but was modified, for God’s values and gift of salvation also needed to be revealed to the Gentiles. God called specific people to a specific task. God desired that both believing Jews and Gentiles would be saved and together be the light of, and the blessing to, the world.

Predestination in the Bible has three basic meanings:

1.	God predestined that there is only one way of salvation, namely, through Jesus Christ (John 14:6, Acts 4:12). We are elected in Christ to eternal life if we accept Him as our personal Savior (Rom. 8:29, Eph. 1:3–8). He wishes for everyone to be saved (1 Tim. 2:3, 4).
2.	God predestined some people (both as individuals or as a commu nity of believers) to a specific task, to a particular mission (as He ordained the faithful remnant to proclaim the eternal gospel). God has a worldwide mission (Isa. 49:6).
3.	God has predestined the final climax of human history when He will come as Judge and give His reward (Daniel 2). The ultimate outcome will be His eschatological triumph. The goal of the electing will of God is not the salvation of a few but the gathering of as many people as possible from among the nations into the final eschatological gath ering (Rev. 21:3).

### Part III: Life Application

**The following questions deal with prophetic time periods:**

1.	Peruse again the aforementioned list of prophets. Focus in on a few names. Discuss specifically how each one of them received his or her call. How did this prophet know that he or she was called?
2.	Why does Ellen G. White fit within this list? How did God use her to be a spiritual leader of His people?
3.	How have people reacted to God’s called leaders throughout his tory? Why is the acceptance of God’s chosen leaders and their leadership so complicated?
4.	What makes the job of God’s called leader difficult?

**Personal Reflection**:

1.	How does one recognize God’s will in life?
2.	What are your passions? In what way does God call you to use your desires and gifts for Him?
3.	How can you collaborate in your church with other gifted people whom God has called to serve but who are very different from you? How can the differences between you become strengths?
4.	How can you be sure that you are doing what God is calling you to do?
