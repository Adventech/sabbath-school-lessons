#### Part I: Overview

**Key Text**: Nehemiah 8:8, 12

**Study Focus**: Ezra 7, Ezra 8, Nehemiah 1–3, Nehemiah 4:7–23, Nehemiah 5:14–19

Ezra and Nehemiah demonstrate what it  means  to  be  a  leader  for  God. God placed them in positions of influence (Ezra as a priest and Nehemiah as a governor), but it was up to them to be responsible in performing their tasks. Both took their jobs seriously, because  they  were aware of God’s calling, were committed to Him, and loved God’s people. They realized that they had influence over the  people  whom they encountered. They used their positions for good. Above all, they demonstrated a passion for God that was palpable. Those who were around them knew that they loved God and that they lived for Him with incredible dedication. That loyalty inspired the Israelite nation to walk with God in a closer relationship.

Ezra and Nehemiah demonstrated courage. They were not afraid to   do something that others shrank from doing, such as take a group of exiles back to Jerusalem where they knew life would be tough. They also encouraged and empowered the people, delegating responsibilities to them instead of simply doing everything themselves. They were leaders with a purpose, having a vision for the people of Israel to be restored  and revived once again. Therefore, they were willing to do all that was necessary to make this dream happen. The two leaders also displayed humility. They were willing to serve the people and not just be served. Nor did they expect, or desire, to receive lots of money for their work. Their lives and leadership give us principles for servant leadership today. Most important, it is the habits that they developed and practiced that we can learn from and apply in our work for God.

#### Part II: Commentary

The keys to being a successful leader are the habits that he or she develops. If a leader cultivates a lifestyle of honesty, transparency, openness, and perseverance by spending time in the Word of God, widely reading and growing through education, he or she will have a much greater spiritual influence on people and the world than someone who, in contrast, spends time in “empty” activities (e.g., killing time by idle chatter, watching television for hours each day, or playing video games). The way we think, and what we focus on, determines our behavior. The habits we develop and practice define how much or how little influence we have on others and how much God can use us and do things through us.

Both Ezra and Nehemiah developed habits from which we can learn. If we want to be leaders who have an impact in the world, we would   do well to learn from them and even model our habits after theirs. The good principles of  life they cultivated are worthy  to  be  imitated. It   is the daily routine that makes a difference, not the big things we do once in a while. So, what was the daily routine of Ezra and Nehemiah? What can we tell about their daily habits from the stories recorded about them?

**Ezra: The Spiritual Leader**

Although Ezra demonstrated many leadership qualities, perhaps what distinguished him the most are two habits: (1) rigorous Scripture study and (2) earnest prayer and fasting. Ezra seems to have developed these habits when he was young and then never strayed from them. He is described as a “skilled scribe in the Law of Moses” (Ezra 7:6, NKJV). The word for “skilled” is mahir and represents someone who is prolific at his job. He received the best education in  the land. The term mahir is very specific and therefore most likely points to Ezra serving as a representative of the Jewish religion to the Persian government.  He was a skilled scribe of the law of Moses, which refers to the teachings of the Hebrew Torah (five books of Moses) and God’s teaching, in general, not just the Ten Commandments, as we usually think of when we hear the term “the law.”

However, Ezra was not a scribe educated just in biblical instruction. Rather, he also was changed by  his knowledge of the law. Knowledge  of the true living God transformed his life. We know that it was the case with Ezra because Ezra 7:10 says: “For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the Law of the Lord, and to do it, and to teach statutes and ordi nances in Israel” (NKJV). The statement that “Ezra had prepared” (kun: to establish, firmly set, fix) his heart is crucial. The heart refers to the mind, thoughts, and emotions. Therefore, his “whole being” was firmly set and dedicated to the law of God. The law of God is synonymous with God, whose character it represents. Ezra, therefore, had firmly resolved himself to study the Word of God and be open to its transforming power. He thus dedicated himself to following it wholeheartedly and then teaching it to others. Ezra understood that his specific call in life was to study and teach God’s Word—His instruction. Ezra’s habits included applying to his personal life the deep understanding of the Hebrew Scriptures he gained. Whatever he read, he practiced.

The second habit, praying and fasting, also is clearly visible through the accounts of Ezra’s leadership. As the people gathered at the river Ahava (Ezra 8:15) before leaving on their journey to Jerusalem, Ezra called for a fast of the whole assembly. He knew that they needed protection on the journey because they could be attacked by marauders at any point. He also fasted and prayed when dealing with the mixed-marriages situation in the nation (Ezra 9, Ezra 10). Thus, it is apparent that he followed a practice that had become his habit whenever encountering a difficult situation. Rather than turning to human advisors only and devising a plan, he first turned to the God of the universe, who ultimately has everything in His hands.

**Nehemiah: The Servant Leader**

One of Nehemiah’s habits was prayer and fasting, as well. When he heard that the people were prevented from continuing the work of rebuilding the city wall because of opposition from their enemies, he    sat down, wept, and mourned for days while fasting and praying. He  was entreating God to have mercy on His people and to intervene. God answered his prayers and sent him to Jerusalem as a leader of the people (Nehemiah 1, Nehemiah 2).

In his acts as governor, we see other habits that Nehemiah displayed. He had a habit of perseverance. He didn’t get discouraged by opposition or even the discouragement of the Israelites. He kept focused on what the next course of action should be, including crying out to God for help, and then going back to work. He armed the Israelites so they could protect themselves and act as a deterrent to any outside forces (Nehemiah 4).   He could have given up because of the severe threats to his life, but his perseverance stemmed from another habit—trusting God. Even trusting in God is a habit that we need to practice. If we make a habit of doubt and mistrusting God, then we may go even further and blame God when the next challenges or problems occur in our life. On the other hand, when we practice trust and faith in God’s promises, we will do it even when tough times come our way.

Another habit that Nehemiah demonstrated was generosity. In Nehemiah 5:14–19, Nehemiah provided for his servants and also for others who did not have many resources and needed a place to eat every day. Instead of collecting wages as a governor in Israel, Nehemiah gave his earnings to the people. It was a habit that he practiced for years. He became indignant when he learned that the leaders of Israel and the rich were taking from those who had become indebted to them (Neh. 5:1–13). Naturally prone to generosity, any injustice to the contrary triggered a quick response in his compassionate heart.

Last, it was not just Ezra who spent time in the Word of God. The governor himself also was an example in that regard (Neh. 8:9). In order for Nehemiah to maintain his passion for God and the vision he had for the people, he had to cultivate the habit of spending time studying the Scriptures (Nehemiah 8). Dedication to God must be cultivated and nurtured. Seeking God without wavering is a propensity that flourishes only through daily time with God.   It is a direct result of prayer and reading the Bible. We need to directly hear from God through His Word. Nehemiah made sure that the people could hear the Scriptures in their language and that it was explained to them. He took charge in collaborating with Ezra, together with Levites, in order to teach the people. A good leader will recognize the gifts of his people. He will then put them to work in their strengths. Nehemiah had the gift of motivating others. He used this gift to inspire his people to unite and work hard, in spite of challenges. Above all, he inspired them to walk with God.
