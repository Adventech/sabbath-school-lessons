### Part I: Overview

**Key Text**: Nehemiah 1:4, 5

**Study Focus**: Nehemiah 1, Nehemiah 2

After the first two groups (the first led by Zerubbabel and the second by Ezra) return, God commissions Nehemiah, cupbearer to King Artaxerxes (Neh. 1:11), to take yet another group of exiles back to Jerusalem. Nehemiah is told that the “remnant” of Jews in Jerusalem are in “great affliction and reproach” (Neh. 1:3) because of the opposition they have encountered in rebuilding the city. Nehemiah is devastated to hear the news from Jerusalem and mourns for days. He fasts and prays to God.

King Artaxerxes notices that Nehemiah is  troubled  and  inquires  why his face looks sad. Prayerfully, Nehemiah answers the king that Jerusalem lies in waste. He requests that the king grant him time to rebuild it. Amazingly, the king grants his request because the monarch saw that “the good hand of my God was upon me” (Neh. 2:8, ESV). God’s providence and His grace were acknowledged by Nehemiah.

Yet, Nehemiah knows that he needs reinforcements because the lead- ers from “beyond the river” have made the Israelites afraid and caused them to stop their work. Because of these leaders’ complaint, King Artaxerxes ceased the reconstruction of Jerusalem. In order to reverse the king’s prior command, Nehemiah now skillfully asks the king to  send a letter with him to the leaders of the region, informing them that Nehemiah is on official business and, therefore, not to be hindered.

Nehemiah 2 ends with Nehemiah scouting out the work that needs     to be done and encouraging the people to build. Emphasize to your students that Nehemiah’s success in securing the king’s favor is a direct consequence of his seeking God in response to the tragic events in Jerusalem (Neh. 1:3). Nehemiah prays and fasts (Neh. 1:4); as a result, God prepares the king and the people to respond favorably.

###Part II: Commentary

**Nehemiah’s Prayer (Nehemiah 1)**

After Nehemiah receives visitors, who have just arrived from Judah, he  is distressed. Because Nehemiah was an official in the king’s court, it is possible that he had prior knowledge of Artaxerxes’s judgment against

Judah. Hostile forces around Jerusalem complained to the king, who capitulated against the onslaught, convinced as they were of the potential political threat the Jews presented (Ezra 4). Either because of rumors    or official government activity, Nehemiah asked about the situation in Judah. Unfortunately, the rumors were not only confirmed by Hanani and his associates, but the truth must have been worse than expected. Nehemiah collapses at the news and mourns for days. However, he goes straight to God with his dilemma.

Nehemiah’s prayer is outlined in the lesson. When analyzing Nehemiah’s prayer, one especially discovers that the main point (the center) of the prayer is entreating God to remember  His  promises. Thus, Nehemiah reminds the readers of  the  big picture—God fulfills His promises. The prayer begins with adoration and worship before Nehemiah asks God to hear his prayer. Offerings of adoration and wor- ship, in turn, are followed by confession of sins and a petition to God to remember His promises to restore His people. Then Nehemiah’s prayer circles back to remind God that these are His redeemed people. Once again, Nehemiah asks for God  to  hear  and  grant  him  mercy  before the king. Nehemiah knows that the king has the power to reverse the situation in Judah and therefore asks for God to work on the king’s heart. Often, we expect answers to prayers right away, but Nehemiah per- severes and prays for more than four months before anything happens. The season of prayer served as a preparation time for  Nehemiah  as leader of the expedition. He had time to process the steps he would take once he arrived in Jerusalem, what he would do in order to maximize the results of the rebuilding process, and perhaps even what material he would need. All of these plans must have become solidified in his mind, because when the king finally asks him, “What do you request?” (Neh. 2:4, NKJV), Nehemiah had a well-thought-out answer.

**Conversation With the King and Sending Nehemiah to Jerusalem (Nehemiah 2:1–10)**

Nehemiah begins his request to the king by speaking about his “fathers’ sepulchers” (Neh. 2:5), or tombs. Respect for ancestors and their proper burial sites was of profound concern in antiquity because, in this man- ner, ancient people expressed their deep respect for their forefathers and  a desire for peace. Nehemiah does not mention Jerusalem by name but simply refers to the importance of burial places and the city he loves. Whether all of the exchange between the king and Nehemiah occurred   in one setting is not known; however, it is possible that the conversation was continued in a more private setting in which the queen was present (Neh. 2:6). Historians believe that King Artaxerxes was influenced by women, and so the presence of his wife (according to Ctesias, a Greek physician and historian, her name was Damaspia, though her name is not mentioned in the biblical text) may have been to Nehemiah’s advantage. We can only speculate.

Nehemiah needed (1) time, (2) credentials so Israel’s enemy leaders would let him pass and cause him no harm, and (3) wood for construc- tion. It is interesting to observe that the king’s officer Asaph, keeper of the imperial forest, is a Jewish name, which suggests that this person  was a Jew like Nehemiah who had risen to a high position. Nehemiah needed the wood for three projects: (1) beams for the gates of a citadel, which was constructed north of the temple for the purpose of protecting its sacred precincts; (2) the city wall; and (3) his residence. It is possible that he was just planning to repair a home that belonged to his family.

**In Jerusalem: Preparation for Rebuilding Walls (Nehemiah 2:11–20)**

Nehemiah arrived in Jerusalem with an envoy of captains of the army and horsemen. On the way, Nehemiah delivered the king’s letter to each of the governors who had part in halting the work on the city walls. After resting for three days, which seems to be a traditional period of time to take after a  long journey,  Nehemiah took a  small group out  on a secret mission during the night. Perhaps the group consisted of  his brother Hanani and close associates or relatives who either came with him to Jerusalem or had already settled there as residents (they informed Nehemiah of the condition of Israel [see Neh. 1:2, 3]). The group quietly surveyed the condition of the walls and gates so as  not  to attract attention to the project prematurely. Sanballat and Tobiah probably had allies in Jerusalem, and Nehemiah rightly suspected that he was being watched.

Nehemiah states: “I told no one what my  God had put in  my  heart to do at Jerusalem” (Neh. 2:12, NKJV). The word for “put” is natan, meaning “to give, put, or  set.” Nehemiah points out that the mission  of rebuilding the fortifications is not his idea but God’s. God placed this burden on his heart; God had given him the drive and the desire to complete the project. It was clear to Nehemiah that this was a divinely commissioned undertaking.

When the nightly expedition is completed and Nehemiah acquires the information needed to map out the work, he  addresses the leaders of the Jews. After strategizing, it is time for action; he invites the Jews to “build the wall of Jerusalem, that we may no longer be a reproach [Heb. cherpa].” Cherpa means “derision, scorn, insult, and contempt.”

Throughout the Old Testament cherpa is often translated as “disgrace” or “reproach” in  the  sense of shame. Ancient cultures were based on a shame-and-honor system. Honor was the most important value, and shame was to be avoided at all costs. Thus, Nehemiah plays on the sen- sitivities toward shame when he presents his argument. He convinces the people to act so that they would reverse the “shame” that they were experiencing at the moment. Having a destroyed defense system made them not only vulnerable but also ashamed. A sense of guilt was asso- ciated with their shame too. Nehemiah voices his people’s feelings of inadequacy and disgrace because they have had to endure oppression. The principal issue was honor and respect and heritage, which they  would build once again through participating in this important work. The ruins of Jerusalem presented their faith in God in a bad light.

When, in Nehemiah 2:18, Nehemiah points out that the hand of   God has been with him and shares what the king had said, the people are persuaded to exclaim: “Let us start rebuilding” (NIV). They do not have to fear the Persian government, and, most important, God is with them. In order to change their situation, they “rise up” and do some- thing. Let this demonstration of faith be a lesson for us. Things do not change by wallowing in misery or finding excuses; they change only through action. Nehemiah encourages the people to do something, to act, and to change their predicament. He entreats them to hold on to God in faith, because He has been leading this expedition and will carry it to completion.

Consequently, when the enemy leaders come at Nehemiah, jeering and laughing at the people’s attempt to build the wall, Nehemiah is not discouraged. He answers, “The God of heaven Himself will prosper us” (Neh. 2:20, NKJV). Nehemiah does not let the enemies win by enter- taining their insults. Instead, the courageous cupbearer claims God’s promises and holds on to His power.

### Part III: Life Application

**Ask the following questions**:

1.	Look through Nehemiah’s prayer and choose which aspects of the prayer you can include in your own prayer life.
2.	Ask each person to reflect on, and answer, the following: Nehemiah knew about the great opposition to rebuilding Jerusalem’s walls that existed before he arrived in the city. If there were a possibility of God sending you on a mission to a place that you knew in advance was beset with great difficulties and opposition, would you volunteer for the job? If so, why?
3.	God called Nehemiah to a specific work. He fasted and prayed  before he spoke to the king, because he felt a burden for his city and people. Do you think of fasting and praying when a difficulty arises in your life? How do fasting and prayer make a difference in our  lives? When was the last time you fasted, and for what cause did you pray and fast?
4.	Before approaching the people about why he was there, Nehemiah went through the city first to figure out what needed to be done.
    1.	Why is planning so important in life?
    2.	Think of specific ministries that you are in charge of, or are a part of, in your church. What specifically can be done to “scout out” your mission before it is implemented?
