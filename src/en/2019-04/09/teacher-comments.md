#### Part I: Overview

**Key Text**: Nehemiah 10:29

**Study Focus**: Ezra 2, Ezra 8, Nehemiah 7, Nehemiah 10, Nehemiah 12

Lesson 9 analyzes several lists and genealogies that are found in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah. The lists include genealogies of those who returned to Judah with Zerubbabel (Ezra 2) and then with Ezra (Ezra 8) and Nehemiah  (Nehemiah  7),  as  well  as  the  enumeration  of the vessels and articles that were brought back by Sheshbazzar (Zerubbabel) for the temple of the Lord (Ezra 1:7–11) after being carried off to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar. In  Nehemiah 12  is  a  list of priests and Levites who are enumerated in order that the true worship of God can continue. The attention to all such detail demonstrates God’s care for even the little things in our lives. Moreover, each of the lists teaches us a lesson. The listing of the vessels from the temple brings us back to the banquet of Belshazzar, who purposefully offends God by using these sacred items for his feast (Daniel 5). On the other hand, Cyrus honors God and His people by sending the articles back with the people to Jerusalem. The genealogical listings remind the reader that God does not forget His people, that He preserves their families, and that each family has a role in God’s work. Unfortunately, the numbering of  the people also demonstrates that not very many     of the Israelites ended up returning to Israel. The majority became comfortable in their new homes and culture and did not want to make the trip back to the Promised Land. Those who went back displayed courage and trust in God’s  guidance despite the uncertain conditions  of rebuilding the land.

#### Part II: Commentary

**Genealogies**

Ezra 2 and Nehemiah 7 list the same group of returnees. It is a repeat of all of the people who eventually returned to Israel from the three groups that came over with Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah. The ultimate number of the whole company returning to Israel is 42,360 (Ezra 2:64, Neh. 7:66). This figure is confusing, however, because it is considerably higher than the sum of the figures given in the two chapters:


|Exile Lists | Ezra 2 | Nehemiah 7|
| ------------|---------------| ------|
|Men of Israel | 24,144 | 25,406|
|Priests | 4,289 | 4,289|
|Levites, Singers, Gatekeepers | 341 | 360|
|Temple Servants (Descendants of Solomon’s Servants) | 392 | 392|
|Men of Unproven Origin | 652 | 642|
|**Totals** | **29,818** | **31,089**|

In both Ezra 2 and Nehemiah 7, the final figures are the same (42,360) but counted a little bit differently. How can we explain these discrepancies? There are a few possibilities. It may be that the total number includes priests of unknown origin (Ezra 2:61–63), and some additional groups also are probably not mentioned. However, the overall message is crystal clear: God knows those who are His, and no one will be forgotten (2 Tim. 2:19).

Ezra 2 and Nehemiah 7 list various categories of people who came  back, along with identifying the names of families, their heads, and representatives. What specific categories of people are listed? Priests, Levites, singers, the Nethinim (temple servants), gatekeepers, sons of Solomon’s servants, as well as some who could not prove that they were Israelites but were accepted among the people, just not part of the priesthood (Ezra 2:59–63). The different categories especially demonstrate the different roles that the Jews held in working for God. We are each given different gifts and sometimes assignments based on the strengths, gifts, and talents God has given us. He has created each one of us different so that together we make one complete body of believers. The singers were just as important as the priests as they led the people in worship. The temple servants had the important job of keeping the temple clean and organized. They also assisted the Levites with their duties.

**List of Animals**

Interestingly, animals also are counted in this list of people who returned from Babylonian exile, specifically 736 horses, 245 mules, 435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys (Ezra 2:66, 67). Some could interpret this enumeration as powerful evidence that God also cares for animals. Throughout the Bible, God shows His concern for all life. God saved animals in Noah’s ark (Gen. 7:2, 3, 8) and refused to destroy Nineveh because not only humans repented but also many animals lived there (see Jon. 4:11). Moreover, God gave humans at Creation a solemn delegated responsibility to represent Him and care for His created world (Gen. 1:28). The same was repeated after the Flood, although with complications (Gen. 9:2) because now the “fear of humans” was placed in animals.

**List of Priests**

In Ezra 8, Ezra the scribe records the genealogy of those who went with him from Babylon. Only about five to six thousand people came back with Ezra. Ezra’s main concern is for the priestly lineage, given that he was a priest but also because priests were important for the proper function of the temple services. Therefore, he begins the record by tracing the descendants of Phinehas (son of Eleazar) and Ithamar, who came from Aaron, the high priest. Next, he traces the political line of King David through Hattush, and then ordinary citizens fill the rest of the account. Exactly 12 clans are mentioned, reminding the reader of the 12 tribes of Israel. Although the 12 tribes did not return in total, the small number of the Jews who did is just as important as if the 12 tribes were still intact. One of the lessons of this genealogy is that just as God never abandoned the 12 tribes of Israel, so He will watch over the returnees.

After Ezra gathers the people at the river Ahava to travel to Jerusalem, he is saddened because the Levites didn’t come. Those who were to teach the people about God and had the greatest role in restoring the people to “walking with God” did not make the decision to return to the land of Israel. So, Ezra acts. He calls nine leaders and a couple men who are described as “men of understanding” (Ezra 8:16) and gives them the task of going to a man named “Iddo” in Casiphia and requesting that he send them Levites, as well as some Nethinims. Not much is known about Iddo or the place of Casiphia, except that it must have been a densely populated site by the Jews. Ezra then praises God because Iddo sent 38 Levites and 220 Nethinims, who were appointed to serve the Levites   and help in the temple. The priestly group responded to the Holy Spirit’s prompting and decided to join the assembly at the Ahava River.

Nehemiah 12 records the names of the priests and Levites from the  time of the first return from Babylon to the time of Ezra and Nehemiah. Once again, the chronicling of the names demonstrates the  signifi cance of the priestly families. The account of the dedication of the wall  of Jerusalem comes right after the listing of the priests and Levites, because before the story is told, it must be established that the nation is fully equipped with the personnel needed for the dedication, as well as committed to godliness.

**List of Gold and Silver Articles**

Before they left for Jerusalem, Ezra proclaimed a fast and a time of prayer.

He did not want to ask for an escort from the king; he spent time on his knees instead. He knew that they needed protection for the journey and needed God to deliver them from looters and raiding parties. Before departing for Jerusalem, Ezra divided the articles and offering for the temple among 12 leaders among the priests. The list of these items is recorded in Ezra 8:24–30. The silver and gold items were a freewill offering to God. As they receive the items, Ezra tells them, “You are holy to the Lord; the articles are holy also” (Ezra 8:28, NKJV). The concept of holiness was a crucial one throughout the book of Ezra as the returnees are to dedicate their lives to God and be His representatives on the earth. Ezra and the leaders wanted to reverse the wrong that their forefathers had committed. They were on a mission for God and were going to do it with full commitment to Him.

**List of Animals for a Burnt Offering**

Another list appears at the end of this account as the exiles arrive in Jerusalem. The list consists of animals offered to God as a burnt offering after arriving safely at their new home (Ezra 8:35). The people offer 12 bulls, 96 rams, 77 lambs, and 12 male goats. The incredible number of animals sacrificed as burnt offerings demonstrates the thankfulness of the returnees. They were grateful for God’s protection as they realized that it was not by chance that they had arrived at Jerusalem safely. They also were looking forward to the future. Because God had taken care of them on the journey there, He had a plan for Israel to prosper.

#### Part III: Life Application

1.	Take each of the lists that are mentioned above and think through other possible lessons that we may learn from each of them.

`a. Answer the following questions as you think about it:`

`(1)	Why did the scribe think it was important to record the list?`

`(2)	Why did God preserve these records?`

`(3)	What does each list mean for you today?`

`(4)	What other characteristics of God can you see through the lists other than that He cares for us and details?`


2.	Holiness was an important concept of the priesthood as well as   of the nation of Israel. On the whole, that is why it was vital to keep records of all the priests and Levites. Throughout the Old Testament, God calls all His people to be holy because He is holy (Lev. 19:2). To be holy because God is holy means that we care about moral uprightness.

`a.	Is holiness and holy living still important today? If yes, why?`

`b.	Does a morally upright person stand out in today’s world?`

`c.	Given that we do not have the Old Testament temple and the priesthood, what can we do to make sure that we, as Adventist Christians, fully live for God and live holy lives?`
