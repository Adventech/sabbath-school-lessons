### Outline #9 From Contamination to
	* Purification

*  The Ram and the Goat
	* Daniel 8:1-8 Why is the kingdom of Babylon omitted from this vision? (548/547 BC)
	* What new information is given in this vision about the future world powers of Medo-Persia and Greece?

*  The rise of the Little Horn
	* Daniel 8:9 Instead of legs of iron (Daniel 2) or a fierce beast with iron teeth (Daniel 7), how is Rome represented in this vision?
	* How can we be certain this little horn not only represents pagan Rome but also the sequel Little Horn power described in Daniel 7? Daniel 8:10-12
	* Some Bible commentators identify this Little Horn power as a pagan Greek king, Antiochus Epiphanes.  Why is this interpretation not consistent with the testimony of the prophet Daniel?

*  The Little Horn’s attack on the ministry of Jesus
	* How did this Little Horn power cast truth to the ground? Daniel 8:12?
	* In what ways did this Little horn power exalt itself “as high as the Prince of the host”?
	* Share a time when you were challenged to base your faith on the clear teachings of the Bible rather than the teachings and traditions of human institutions.

*  The cleansing of the Sanctuary
	* Daniel 8:13-14 Why it is important to recognize the connection between the cleansing of the sanctuary and the judgment scene described in Daniel 7:9-14?
	* Hebrews 8:1-2 – this sanctuary is in heaven
	* Hebrews 9:23-28 – Christ’s ministry is described

*  The prophetic timetable
	* Some commentators interpret these 2300 evenings and mornings as 1150 literal days, or a little over 3 years.  How is this interpretation flawed?
		* Daniel 8:17
		* Daniel 8:26
	* Applying the year-day principle for interpreting Bible prophecy (Ezekiel 4:6), this prophecy extends for 2300 years.  How does this knowledge help us to understand the reaction of the prophet Daniel, recorded in Daniel 8:27?
	* Daniel 8 does not provide the information regarding when this 2300-day prophecy will begin. The prophet will have to wait until the angel Gabriel visits him again.  Daniel 9:20-23 What important lesson can we learn from Daniel’s experience?
	* What encouraging promise and important counsel does the apostle John give to those who study the apocalyptic prophecies of the Bible? Revelation 1:3
