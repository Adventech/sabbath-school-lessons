### Outline #7  From the Lion’s Den to the Angel’s Den

*  Jealous government officials
	* Daniel 6:1-3 Why did King Darius retain one of conquered government officials for his new leadership team?
	* Daniel 6:4a How did this decision impact the Persian government leaders?
	* Daniel 6:4b-5 What conclusion did these jealous government officials come to after a careful investigation of Daniel’s conduct?
	* Our lives are also being careful examined by critics and genuine seekers after truth.  How can we ensure we are providing a faithful witness to those around us? (see Matthew 5:14-16 and John 8:12)

*  A plot to trap Daniel
	* Daniel 6:6-9 What tactics did these jealous government officials use to pressure the King into signing the decree?
	* Daniel 6:10 If Daniel was aware of the evil intentions of these jealous government officials, why didn’t he expose their plan to King Darius or change his prayer schedule?
	* Compare this test and the test Daniel’s three friends faced on the plain of Dura.
	* Consider also the example of the apostles before the Sanhedrin. Acts 5:26-29, 41-42. Why is it important to decide ahead of time how we will respond when pressured to compromise our faith?
	* Share a time when a person or organization tried to coerce you to act in a way that was contrary to the Word of God. What was the outcome?

*  Caught in a trap
	* Daniel 6:11-13 How did the jealous government officials react when Daniel continued his prayers to God “as was his custom”?
	* Daniel 6:14-18 What was the reaction of King Darius when he realized he himself had also been trapped by these jealous government officials?
	* What is the best course of action when we realize we have been caught in a trap laid by an enemy?

*  Vindication
	* Daniel 6:19-20 What can we learn as we observe the behavior of King Darius the following morning?
	* Daniel 6:21-22 What impresses you as you hear Daniel’s testimony to King Darius?
	* How does Daniel’s powerful witness impact the King? Daniel 6:23, 24, 25-27, 28
	* Not everyone is delivered like Daniel.  Why?
	* What important lessons can we learn from Daniel’s experience for our lives today?
