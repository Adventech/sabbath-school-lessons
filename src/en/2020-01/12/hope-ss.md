### Outline #12  From North and South to the Beautiful Land

*  Parallels in the prophecies of the book of Daniel
	* Each prophecy begins in the days of the prophet and extends to the end of time.
	* Each prophecy describes a succession of world powers, often oppressing God’s people.
	* Each prophecy concludes with a positive outcome.
	* Why are the words from the LORD such an encouragement to us today? Isaiah 46:9-10

*  Persia and Greece – Daniel 11:1-4
	* v.2 After Cyrus, Camyses, False Smerdis, Darius I—then Xerxes/Ahasuerus.
	* v.3-4 Alexander the Great, then Seleucus, Ptolemy, Lysimachus, Cassander.

*  Syria and Egypt – Daniel 11:4-14
	* Ongoing conflict between Seleucid dynasty (north) and Ptolemaic dynasty (south)
	* Failed attempt at alliance when Antiochus II Theos, grandson of Seleucus I, married Berenice, daughter of Ptolemy II Philadelphus. v.6

*  Rome and the Prince of the Covenant – Daniel 11:16-28
	* Daniel 11:16 When did Pagan Rome stand in the Glorious Land (Palestine)? (see also Daniel 8:9)
	* Daniel 11:20 Where do we see this prophecy fulfilled in the Gospel story? (Luke 2:1-3)
	* Daniel 11:21 – referring to Tiberius Caesar, remembered as an eccentric and vile person.
	* Daniel 11:22 During the reign of Tiberius Caesar, the “Prince of the covenant” would be broken. (see Daniel 9:25 and Luke 3:1, Matthew 27:33-50)

*  The Next Power – Daniel 11:29-39
	* From our studies of the prophecies of Daniel 7 and Daniel 8, what is the next power that arises out of the ruins of Pagan Rome?
	* Compare Daniel 11:29-36 with Daniel 7:23-25. Who is the next manifestation of the King of the North?
	* The King of the South also represents another force that, like Egypt, makes no pretense of worshipping the one true God.

*  Final Events – Daniel 11:40-45
	* What is the timing for these final events of chapter 11? (see also Daniel 8:17, 12:4)
	* Who is the King of the North and the King of the South in this final battle?
	* What good news do you see in Daniel 11:41?
	* Who is the ultimate manifestation of all forces opposed to God and His faithful followers? Isaiah 14:12-14, Revelation 12:17
	* Why is the revelation of Daniel 12:1-3 an important conclusion to the turmoil of Daniel 11?
