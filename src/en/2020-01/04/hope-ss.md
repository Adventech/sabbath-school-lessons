### Outline #4 From Furnace to Palace

*  The building of a huge golden image
	* Daniel 3:1-7 Why do you think Nebuchadnezzar ordered the construction of a huge golden image?
	* What other stories in the Bible illustrate a desire to trust in human strength rather than trust in God?
	* Why was Nebuchadnezzar so slow to learn the importance of trusting fully in the God of heaven?

*  The command to worship the golden image
	* Daniel 3:8-15
	* Think of other times in history when people have been forced to worship in a way that was contrary to the clear teachings of the Bible.  Who is behind all such forced idolatry? (see Matthew 4:8-10, Isaiah 14:12-14)
	* Why is this story recorded in Daniel 3 particularly relevant for our lives today? Revelation 13:11-18

*  The test of fire
	* Daniel 3:16-18 What impresses you as you hear the testimony of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego?
	* Daniel 3:19-23 Why did the attitude of Nebuchadnezzar change from respect to rage?
	* What details in this story emphasize the severity of this fiery test?
	* Share a time when your loyalty and faithfulness to God faced a fiery test.

*  The Fourth Man in the fire
	* Daniel 3:24-25
	* Daniel 3:26-27 How does the presence of the Fourth Man in the fiery furnace impact those who witness the scene?
	* Share some promises in the Bible where God assures us He will be with us as we face the fiery trials of life. Isaiah 43:2, Psalm 50:15, etc.
	* Sometimes God delivers us from the fire.  Other times He delivers us through the fire.  Still other times He delivers us after the fire. Share examples of those who faced death unafraid, trusting in God that their ultimate deliverance was sure.

*  The response of King Nebuchadnezzar
	* Daniel 3:28 What are your thoughts about Nebuchadnezzar’s confession?
	* Daniel 3:29-30 What are your thoughts about Nebuchadnezzar’s two declarations?

*  The gift of courageous faith
	* Hebrews 11:1-6 How can we develop courageous faith like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego?
	* Ephesians 2:8 – courageous faith is a gift of God
	* What lesson can we learn from the absence of Daniel in this story?
