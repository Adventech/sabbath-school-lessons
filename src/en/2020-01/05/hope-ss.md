### Outline #5  From Pride to Humility

*  Another dream from God
	* Daniel 4:4-5, 10-17 King Nebuchadnezzar was troubled.  What was the difference between this situation and the one recorded in Daniel 2?
	* Why did God give this dream to the King? (see Psalm 32:8-10)

*  Seeking an interpretation for the dream
	* Daniel 4:6-7 What important lesson has King Nebuchadnezzar failed to learn?
	* Daniel 4:8-9,18 What distinguished Daniel from the other wise men of Babylon?
	* Why didn’t the king call Daniel first?
	* What important lesson can we learn from this first part of the story for our lives today?

*  The dream interpreted
	* Daniel 4:19-26
	* How does Daniel’s reaction (v.19) reflect the teaching of Jesus and the character of the God of heaven?

*  Daniel’s appeal to the King
	* Daniel 4: 27 What was Daniel’s appeal to King Nebuchadnezzar after interpreting the dream?
	* Share some other stories in the Bible which emphasize the importance of repentance before a time of judgment. (Jonah 3:1-10, Jeremiah 18:5-8)
	* How does King Nebuchadnezzar respond to Daniel’s appeal? Daniel 4:28-30
	* What other stories in the Bible illustrate the great danger of a proud spirit?

*  Judgment and mercy
	* Daniel 4:31-33 What was the result of King Nebuchadnezzar’s pride and arrogance?
	* This seems like a very stern judgment. How does this judgment reflect the love and mercy of God? (see 2 Peter 3:9)
	* Daniel 4:34-36 How did God show mercy to King Nebuchadnezzar at the end of seven years?
	* What change occurred in the King’s heart and mind that enabled him to receive the mercy of God?

*  King Nebuchadnezzar’s humble testimony
	* Daniel 4:37 What impresses you the most about King Nebuchadnezzar’s testimony?
	* How does this testimony differ from the King’s decrees in Daniel 2:47 and Daniel 3:28-29?
	* Share a time in your life when you lifted your eyes toward heaven after wandering in the wilderness of this world.
	* How does fixing our eyes on Jesus protect us from pride and arrogance? (see Philippians 2:1-11)
