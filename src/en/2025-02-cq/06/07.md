Share insights from this week’s memory verse and Bible study as well as any discoveries, observations, and questions with your Sabbath School class (or Bible study group). Consider these discussion questions with the rest of the group.

`How did Israel fall so far from God as to be worshiping Baal?`

`Why do you think God chose to demonstrate His supremacy on Mount Carmel the way He did? What else could He have done?`

`Was Elijah wrong for making fun of the false priests of Baal and Asherah? Why or why not?`

`Elijah was sent as a prophet to the ten tribes of Israel. Why didn’t he build the altar out of ten stones instead of twelve?`

`Why do you think Elijah doused the sacrifice three times? How do you think the Israelites felt as they watched this “waste” of water?`

`What are some of the gods that people worship today instead of the true God?`

`If your worship altar is broken down, what steps can you take to rebuild it?`

`How do rebuilt altars of worship and devotion rebuild those who daily seek the Lord?`

`What does Elijah’s stand on Mount Carmel tell us about God’s call to sometimes stand alone?`
