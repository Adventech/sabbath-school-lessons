Share insights from this week’s memory verse and Bible study as well as any discoveries, observations, and questions with your Sabbath School class (or Bible study group). Consider these discussion questions with the rest of the group.

`What are the markers of true worship?`

`If the location of worship is not important, why should we bother going to church? (E.g., Matt. 18:20; Heb. 10:23–25)`

`Can you tell a true worshiper from a fake one? If so, how?`

`When Jesus engaged the woman at the well, He was tired and thirsty. How ready are you to share the gospel when you are weary and in need of refreshment?`

`Why did Jesus reveal His messiahship to a sinner and “spiritual outsider” before revealing it to His disciples, who were closer to Him? (John 4:25–27)`

`What social taboos prevent Christians today from sharing their faith with others?`

`What food was Jesus speaking of when He told the disciples He had food they didn’t know about (John 4:32)?`

`What resulted from the Samaritan woman’s testimony to her city? Why was she so effective? (John 4:39–42)`
