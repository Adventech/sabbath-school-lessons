Read This Week’s Passage: Colossians 3

**Red Door Reads**

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I tried something novel. I decided to record a word of encouragement each day and post it on social media. The world was filled with so much fear and suffering that I wanted to offer people hope from God’s Word. Each morning I rose early, chose a scripture, and prepared a three-minute reflection on it. I called it Red Door Reads, since the front door to my home is red.

It didn’t take long for viewers from around the world to begin following me. Many wrote to thank me for the messages. They mentioned how some messages came directly from God at just the moment they needed them most. The testimonies I received truly touched my heart as God used my little ministry to uplift people and turn their hearts to Him.

One mother sent me a message about her teen daughter, who was depressed and drifting aimlessly along in her life. She told me how she shared my messages with her daughter each day. “I don’t know what it is, but your messages connect with her like nothing else. God bless you! Now we both watch them, and we are so blessed. I can’t thank you enough!” Her words completely melted my heart. I knew the praise truly belonged to God. He was the One using my feeble gifts to help save a young woman whose mother had been praying earnestly for her. I thanked the mother for her message and praised God for allowing a sinner like me to be a channel of blessing. Several years have passed since I stopped recording and posting Red Door Reads, but I still receive notifications from people who have recently discovered my messages or have begun watching them again.

Red Door Reads was the overflow from time spent with God in His Word. I simply shared with others what God was sharing with me each day at the altar with Him. This week, we will look at the critical role that the Word of God plays in our altar experiences with Him.
