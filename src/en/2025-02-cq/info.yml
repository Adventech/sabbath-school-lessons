  title: "Back to the Altar"
  description: "It began during my junior year of high school, when I was around sixteen years old. At the time, my attitude left a lot to be desired. My parents decided I needed a change of scenery, so they sent me to Pine Forge Academy, a Seventh-day Adventist boarding school in a rural part of the state of Pennsylvania, USA. Pine Forge was about as far from the city as one could get. With five kids in Christian education, the financial sacrifice my parents were making to send me there was real. They sacrificed so that my siblings and I could be intercepted and transformed by God. That is exactly what happened to me."
