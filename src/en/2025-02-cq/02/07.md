Share insights from this week’s memory verse and Bible study as well as any discoveries, observations, and questions with your Sabbath School class (or Bible study group). Consider these discussion questions with the rest of the group.

`What do you think Adam and Eve were thinking when God prepared them garments made from skins to wear? (Gen. 3:21)`

`What parallels do you see between the animal slain by God in Eden and Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God?`

`How would it impact you personally to build an altar and offer animal sacrifices?`

`Why did God institute altars and animal sacrifices as an act of worship in the Old Testament? Why didn’t He establish a more sanitized form of worship?`

`How can you better rely on Jesus’ blood to cover your sins?`

`What has God sacrificed to save you? What kinds of sacrifices should we make in response?`

`What hope can you share with others based on this week’s study of the altar in Eden?`
