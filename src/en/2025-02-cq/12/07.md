`Why does the world need a revival of true worship in the last days? (Rev. 14:6, 7)`

`How important are our daily devotions in the context of the first angel’s message? What other aspects of worship are also important?`

`Why must people renounce or leave false systems of worship? Can’t God save them where they are? (Rev. 14:8)`

`How are we sometimes lulled into a false sense of security by our knowledge of the three angels’ messages? Is knowing enough to save us?`

`Do you believe Seventh-day Adventists have a special message to share with the world? Why or why not?`

`How can you help your friends prepare for Jesus’ soon coming?`

`How are other people impacted when you neglect your daily worship time with God?`

`How does your daily worship experience prepare you to stand for God when persecution comes?`

`How could engaging in consistent personal worship time affect your home, family, church, and community?`
