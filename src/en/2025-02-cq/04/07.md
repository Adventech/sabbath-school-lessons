### inQuire

Share insights from this week’s memory verse and Bible study as well as any discoveries, observations, and questions with your Sabbath School class (or Bible study group). Consider these discussion questions with the rest of the group.

`Why did God have the Israelites build a place of worship so soon after leaving Egypt?`

`What item in the sanctuary most speaks to your heart? Why?`

`How do you think it felt to be one of the Israelites chosen to work at the temple?`

`How does God transform us when we worship Him? Be specific.`

`What practices can you do to keep God as the center of your life?`

`Where is your sanctuary for meeting with God? What’s special about that place? If you don’t currently have one, brainstorm a few!`

`How would you go about sharing your understanding of the sanctuary and its worship with someone who knows nothing about it?`
