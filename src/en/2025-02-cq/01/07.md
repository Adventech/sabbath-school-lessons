### inQuire

Share insights from this week’s memory verse and Bible study as well as any discoveries, observations, and questions with your Sabbath School class (or Bible study group). Consider these discussion questions with the rest of the group.

`What was the nature of Adam and Eve’s relationship with God? What do you think they talked about?`

`If Adam and Eve fell in a perfect world, how can we who live in a fallen world resist Satan’s temptations?`

`If God knows all things and knew where Adam was hiding with Eve, why did He ask where he was (Gen. 3:9)?`

`What does Adam and Eve blaming others for their decisions tell you about yourself? (Gen. 3:12, 13)`

`What in your life makes you afraid to be honest with God?`

`Why do you think God used symbolic language in Genesis 3:15? Why not clearly state that Jesus would crush the devil’s head?`

`In what area of your life has God given you victory? Share your testimony with the class if you’re comfortable.`

`What role does the body of Christ (i.e., fellow believers) play in helping us remain faithful to God?`

`What can you do daily to prepare for temptations? Which will you do today?`
