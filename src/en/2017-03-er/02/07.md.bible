“In almost every church [in Paul’s day] there were some who were Jews by birth. The Jewish teachers worked through these members to gain power. No one could use the Bible to weaken Paul’s teachings. So instead, the most dishonest lies were told about Paul to weaken his power. Some said Paul had not been one of Jesus’ first disciples. [Disciples are followers of Christ.] Others said Paul received no command from Jesus to preach. And they argued that Paul decided to teach things that went against the other apostles. . . .

“Paul saw the evils that threatened to quickly destroy the churches. He wrote right away to the Galatians and uncovered their false teachings. With very strong words, Paul scolded those who had left the truth.”—Adapted, Ellen G. White, Sketches [Stories] From the Life of Paul, pages 188, 189.

#### Discussion questions

`1. Read again Paul’s greeting to the Galatians. In these verses, he says that Jesus’ death happened for a very important reason. What was that reason? And what meaning does it have for us today?`

`2. In <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 1:14">Galatians 1:14</a>, Paul says he was once very eager to defend the traditions of the Jews who lived before him. By “traditions” Paul probably means the teachings of the Pharisees. A Pharisee was a member of a Jewish religious group. They followed Jewish laws very strictly. What part do traditions have in our faith? What warning might Paul’s experience have for us about not putting traditions ahead of Bible truth?`

`3. Why does Paul “seem” not to put up with those who do not agree with what he said and did? Read again what he writes about people who had different ideas of the gospel. How might someone with Paul’s strong views on things be looked at in our church today?`

**Summary**: The false teachers in Galatia worked against Paul. They said God did not choose Paul to be an apostle or give Paul his message. Paul deals with both of these attacks in the opening verses of his letter to the Galatians. He boldly says that there is only one way to be saved. And he tells how his becoming a follower of Christ shows that his calling and gospel could come only from God.
