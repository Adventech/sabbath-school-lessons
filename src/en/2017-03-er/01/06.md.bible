            'Acts 10:1–11:18': '<h3> <span>Acts 10:1-11:18</span></h3><p><span><span>10&#xA0;</span>There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of what was called the Italian Regiment, </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>a devout <i>man</i> and one who feared God with all his household, who gave alms generously to the people, and prayed to God always. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>About the ninth hour of the day he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God coming in and saying to him, &#x201C;Cornelius!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>And when he observed him, he was afraid, and said, &#x201C;What is it, lord?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>So he said to him, &#x201C;Your prayers and your alms have come up for a memorial before God. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>Now send men to Joppa, and send for Simon whose surname is Peter. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>He is lodging with Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea. He will tell you what you must do.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>And when the angel who spoke to him had departed, Cornelius called two of his household servants and a devout soldier from among those who waited on him continually. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>So when he had explained all <i>these</i> things to them, he sent them to Joppa.</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>The next day, as they went on their journey and drew near the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Then he became very hungry and wanted to eat; but while they made ready, he fell into a trance </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>and saw heaven opened and an object like a great sheet bound at the four corners, descending to him and let down to the earth. </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>In it were all kinds of four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, creeping things, and birds of the air. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>And a voice came to him, <span>&#x201C;Rise, Peter; kill and eat.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>But Peter said, &#x201C;Not so, Lord! For I have never eaten anything common or unclean.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>And a voice <i>spoke</i> to him again the second time, <span>&#x201C;What God has cleansed you must not call common.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>This was done three times. And the object was taken up into heaven again.</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>Now while Peter wondered within himself what this vision which he had seen meant, behold, the men who had been sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon&#x2019;s house, and stood before the gate. </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>And they called and asked whether Simon, whose surname was Peter, was lodging there.</span></p><p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>While Peter thought about the vision, the Spirit said to him, &#x201C;Behold, three men are seeking you. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Arise therefore, go down and go with them, doubting nothing; for I have sent them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>Then Peter went down to the men who had been sent to him from Cornelius, and said, &#x201C;Yes, I am he whom you seek. For what reason have you come?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>And they said, &#x201C;Cornelius <i>the</i> centurion, a just man, one who fears God and has a good reputation among all the nation of the Jews, was divinely instructed by a holy angel to summon you to his house, and to hear words from you.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>Then he invited them in and lodged <i>them.</i></span></p><p><span>On the next day Peter went away with them, and some brethren from Joppa accompanied him.</span></p><p><span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>And the following day they entered Caesarea. Now Cornelius was waiting for them, and had called together his relatives and close friends. </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>As Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshiped <i>him.</i> </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>But Peter lifted him up, saying, &#x201C;Stand up; I myself am also a man.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>And as he talked with him, he went in and found many who had come together. </span> <span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>Then he said to them, &#x201C;You know how unlawful it is for a Jewish man to keep company with or go to one of another nation. But God has shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean. </span> <span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>Therefore I came without objection as soon as I was sent for. I ask, then, for what reason have you sent for me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>So Cornelius said, &#x201C;Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing, </span> <span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>and said, &#x2018;Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your alms are remembered in the sight of God. </span> <span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>Send therefore to Joppa and call Simon here, whose surname is Peter. He is lodging in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea. When he comes, he will speak to you.&#x2019; </span> <span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>So I sent to you immediately, and you have done well to come. Now therefore, we are all present before God, to hear all the things commanded you by God.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>Then Peter opened <i>his</i> mouth and said: &#x201C;In truth I perceive that God shows no partiality. </span> <span><sup>35&#xA0;</sup>But in every nation whoever fears Him and works righteousness is accepted by Him. </span> <span><sup>36&#xA0;</sup>The word which <i>God</i> sent to the children of Israel, preaching peace through Jesus Christ&#x2014;He is Lord of all&#x2014; </span> <span><sup>37&#xA0;</sup>that word you know, which was proclaimed throughout all Judea, and began from Galilee after the baptism which John preached: </span> <span><sup>38&#xA0;</sup>how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him. </span> <span><sup>39&#xA0;</sup>And we are witnesses of all things which He did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem, whom they killed by hanging on a tree. </span> <span><sup>40&#xA0;</sup>Him God raised up on the third day, and showed Him openly, </span> <span><sup>41&#xA0;</sup>not to all the people, but to witnesses chosen before by God, <i>even</i> to us who ate and drank with Him after He arose from the dead. </span> <span><sup>42&#xA0;</sup>And He commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that it is He who was ordained by God <i>to be</i> Judge of the living and the dead. </span> <span><sup>43&#xA0;</sup>To Him all the prophets witness that, through His name, whoever believes in Him will receive remission of sins.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>44&#xA0;</sup>While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who heard the word. </span> <span><sup>45&#xA0;</sup>And those of the circumcision who believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles also. </span> <span><sup>46&#xA0;</sup>For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God.</span></p><p><span>Then Peter answered, </span> <span><sup>47&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Can anyone forbid water, that these should not be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit just as we <i>have?</i>&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>48&#xA0;</sup>And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then they asked him to stay a few days.</span></p><p><span><span>11&#xA0;</span>Now the apostles and brethren who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And when Peter came up to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision contended with him, </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>saying, &#x201C;You went in to uncircumcised men and ate with them!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>But Peter explained <i>it</i> to them in order from the beginning, saying: </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;I was in the city of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision, an object descending like a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came to me. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>When I observed it intently and considered, I saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, creeping things, and birds of the air. </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>And I heard a voice saying to me, <span>&#x2018;Rise, Peter; kill and eat.&#x2019;</span> </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>But I said, &#x2018;Not so, Lord! For nothing common or unclean has at any time entered my mouth.&#x2019; </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>But the voice answered me again from heaven, <span>&#x2018;What God has cleansed you must not call common.&#x2019;</span> </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Now this was done three times, and all were drawn up again into heaven. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>At that very moment, three men stood before the house where I was, having been sent to me from Caesarea. </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Then the Spirit told me to go with them, doubting nothing. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered the man&#x2019;s house. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>And he told us how he had seen an angel standing in his house, who said to him, &#x2018;Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon whose surname is Peter, </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>who will tell you words by which you and all your household will be saved.&#x2019; </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, as upon us at the beginning. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how He said, <span>&#x2018;John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.&#x2019;</span> </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>If therefore God gave them the same gift as <i>He gave</i> us when we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could withstand God?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>When they heard these things they became silent; and they glorified God, saying, &#x201C;Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance to life.&#x201D;</span></p>'
            'Acts 15:1–5': '<h3> <span>Acts 15:1-5</span></h3><p><span><span>15&#xA0;</span>And certain <i>men</i> came down from Judea and taught the brethren, &#x201C;Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, when Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and dispute with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas and certain others of them should go up to Jerusalem, to the apostles and elders, about this question.</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>So, being sent on their way by the church, they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, describing the conversion of the Gentiles; and they caused great joy to all the brethren. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>And when they had come to Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders; and they reported all things that God had done with them. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>But some of the sect of the Pharisees who believed rose up, saying, &#x201C;It is necessary to circumcise them, and to command <i>them</i> to keep the law of Moses.&#x201D;</span></p>'

_<a class="verse" verse="Acts 15:1–5">Acts 15:1–5</a>_

It was not long before trouble began within the churches of the first believers. To begin with, not everyone was happy that Gentile believers had joined the church. The first Christians agreed they needed to reach the Gentiles. But they disagreed over what Gentiles should be asked to do to join the church. Some felt that faith in Jesus was not enough to be a Christian. They argued that to be true Christians the Gentiles would need to do two things. First, all male Gentiles would need to be circumcised. To be circumcised means that the skin at the end of the sex organ of a man or a boy is cut off. Second, Gentile believers would need to obey the law of Moses.

<a class="verse" verse="Acts 10:1–11:18">Acts 10:1–11:18</a> tells of Peter’s experience with Cornelius, a Gentile. Cornelius is a Roman soldier who is not circumcised. Peter baptizes Cornelius. The Jewish believers in the church are upset over the baptism. Their feelings are a clear example in the church of the disagreement over Gentiles. Letting one or two Gentiles join the church may have upset some believers. But Paul wants to throw open wide the doors of the church for all Gentiles to join just by believing in Jesus alone. This is why some believers try to stop Paul’s work among the Gentiles.

`Read <a class="verse" verse="Acts 15:1–5">Acts 15:1–5</a>. How do the believers from Judea try to overturn Paul’s work with Gentile Christians in Antioch?`

In the end, the Jerusalem Council takes Paul’s side in the debate over whether Gentile believers need to be circumcised. But many Jewish believers still try to stop Paul from taking the gospel to the Gentiles. Seven years pass after the Jerusalem Council. Then Paul makes one last visit to Jerusalem. Many people there are still suspicious about Paul’s gospel. In fact, Paul nearly loses his life when he visits the temple. Jews from Asia cry out against him, “ ‘Men of Israel,’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="Acts 21:28">Acts 21:28</a>, KJV) “ ‘help us! . . . This is the man who teaches everyone in all places against our people. He speaks against our law and against this holy place’ ” (NIrV).

`Put yourself in the place of the Jewish believers who were upset by Paul’s teaching. What can they teach us about how our own ideas can lead us in the wrong direction? How can we learn to keep from making the mistakes they did?`
