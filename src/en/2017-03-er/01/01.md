> <p>MEMORY VERSE</p>
> “When they heard this, they [did not] object anymore. They praised God. They said, ‘So then, God has allowed even those who [are not] Jews to turn away from their sins and live’ ” (Acts 11:18, NIrV).

SAUL OF TARSUS was a very strict Jew. All his life he was taught how important the law was. He also was taught to hope in the coming Messiah. The Messiah was the One chosen by God to save Israel from sin. But the Jews believed the Messiah would free them from their political enemies instead. The Jews waited so long for the Messiah to come. And when He did, He was put to death as the worst of criminals. But the idea of a Messiah who was put to death was just too much for Saul to accept.

Saul believed that the teachings of Jesus’ death on a cross and His return from the dead were terrible lies. And anyone who believed these lies should be punished. So Saul made up his mind to rid Israel of these beliefs. In fact, one of the first times we see Saul in the Bible, he is persecuting Jews who believed in Jesus.

But God had far different plans for Saul of Tarsus. Saul never imagined in his wildest dreams that one day he would preach that Jesus was the Messiah. And Saul would even preach this truth among those who were not Jews!
