### The Waldenses in Poland

_by Andrew McChesney_

The police kept bothering Ryszard Jankowski. Every time Ryszard set up a book stand to sell books, the police showed up. Ryszard sold Ellen White’s _The Great Controversy_ and other religious books in Poland. The police ordered Ryszard to remove the book stand and all the books.

Then the Polish Seventh-day Adventist printing press printed a special copy of the Signs of the Times magazine. Church leaders sent copies to members of the Polish government. One government leader liked the magazine very much. So, he wrote a letter to government leaders in different towns in Poland and asked them to help send out the magazine to people. Ryszard took the letter and a copy of the magazine to the mayor of the vacation town where he had trouble with the police in the past.The mayor liked the magazine very much. The major knew the government leader who wrote the letter about the magazine.

The mayor told Ryszard, “I know this man. He was my professor at the university. Of course, you may sell this magazine to people in this town.”

Ryszard asked, “May I get your permission in writing?”

The mayor wrote a letter and gave it to Ryszard.

Ryszard took the letter with him when he set up his book stand on the street. Ryszard put the Signs of the Times maga­zine on the stand together with _The Great Controversy_ and other books. Soon, the police came. A policeman told Ryszard, “You can’t sell your books in our city.”

Ryszard said, “Look, I have a letter from the mayor.”

The policemen read the letter carefully. Then they saluted Ryszard. One policeman told Ryszard, “You can stay.”

But that wasn’t the end of the story. Shortly after, a grandmother stopped by the book stand. Not long ago, someone gave her _The Great Controversy_. The grandmother liked the book very much. She liked the stories about the Waldenses. The Waldenses were a group of people who lived in Europe during the Middle Ages. They shared their faith with other people, even when sharing Bible truth put their lives at risk. The grandmother told Ryszard that her grandson wanted to be like the Waldensian young people. Her grandson understood that he needed to be loyal to God and the Bible.

The grandmother said, “My grandson saw your stand and your book _The Great Controversy_. He said to me, ‘Grandma, the Waldensians are in our town.’ ”

So, the grandmother went to meet Ryszard and to tell him about her grandson. Later, the grandmother joined the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
