### Sekule’s Story (Part 3): Bible Answers

_by Andrew McChesney_

On Friday evening, Sekule waited outside the room of a student at his high school. Sekule’s school was in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Sekule was waiting for a boy who insulted him. When the boy came out of his room, Sekule planned to beat him up.

While Sekule waited, a friend offered him some alcohol. Sekule drank. After many more drinks, he got drunk and passed out. In the morning, Sekule knew his friends would tease him for not getting his revenge. So, Sekule decided to hide for the day. But where? Then he remembered the invitation from his Adventist teacher to go to church. Today was the Sabbath.

Sekule’s hair was long and greasy. He hadn’t washed it for a month. Sekule’s breath smelled bad from drinking. But he went to church anyway. He heard that Adventists celebrated the Sabbath with sex parties every week. Sekule didn’t want to be sitting next to a grandmother when that happened. Sekule saw a very pretty young woman and sat next to her.

When the church pastor started to preach, Sekule’s mouth dropped open in surprise. The pastor gave Bible answers to his questions about God and hell. Sekule felt so grateful to learn that God is really a God of love (1 John 4:8). God also wants to save every sinner (Luke 19:10). Best of all, God will put no one in everlasting hellfire (Malachi 4:1, 3; Psalm 37:10, 11).

After the sermon, a church member invited Sekule to some Bible meetings. Sekule went. At the end of the meetings, Sekule asked the church pastor, “Tell me, please, what I am allowed to do as a Christian. And what am I not allowed to do?”

The pastor told him, “You can’t work on Sabbath anymore.”

Sekule said, “OK, done.”

The pastor said, “You can’t go to school on Sabbath.”

Sekule nodded. “OK, done.”

The pastor added, “You can’t beat people up anymore.

Sekule agreed. “OK, done.”

“You can’t eat meat that isn’t clean.”

Sekule said, “OK, I won’t eat meat that’s not clean.”

The pastor added, “We suggest that you not eat any meat.”

From that day, Sekule never again worked on Sabbath. He stopped going to school on Sabbath, too. Sekule never fought again or ate any meat. He got baptized six months later when he was 18 years old. Sekule accepted these Adventist teachings right away. Why? Because the pastor gave him excellent Bible answers to his questions about God and hell.
