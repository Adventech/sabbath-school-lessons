### Sekule’s Story (Part 5): Loyal to God

_by Andrew McChesney_

Sekule became a soldier. During his first few weeks in the army, Sekule went with a group of soldiers to work on a mountain in what used to be the country of Yugoslavia. On a Friday afternoon, Sekule was ordered to shovel coal during Sabbath hours.

The army commander told Sekule what he must do. “You must shovel for 15 minutes. Rest for 10 minutes after that. Then shovel again for another 15 minutes.

Sekule said, “I will shovel for two and a half hours without stopping until the sun goes down. Then I will stop.”

The commander said, “No one can shovel for two hours.”

Sekule answered, “I can.”

Sekule learned how to work hard during his childhood in Montenegro. He shoveled as fast as he could. The other soldiers told Sekule to slow down. They asked, “Why are you working so fast?”

Sekule told them, “I’m trying to do as much as I can. Then you won’t need to do so much work.”

Sekule’s words filled the other soldiers with respect. The soldiers saw that Sekule wanted to help them. Everyone was surprised when Sekule shoveled enough coal by sunset.

The commander didn’t understand that Sekule wanted to keep the Sabbath all the time. On another Sabbath, the captain read a list of duties to the soldiers and told them, “You will work today.”

Sekule stood tall and brave. “Today is my Sabbath, and I can’t do any work.”

The commander said, “What do you mean ‘can’t’?”

Sekule said, “I’m Seventh-day Adventist. I can’t work on Sabbath.”

The commander gave Sekule an angry look. He said, “Soldier, who will work in your place then?”

All the other soldiers stood tall. They said together, “We will!”

At that moment, Sekule learned an important lesson: we must be loyal both to God and to other people. Jesus said to love “ ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, all your mind, and all your strength.’ The second most impor­tant command is this: ‘Love your neighbor the same as you love yourself.’ These two commands are the most important’ ” (Mark 12:30, 31, ERV). Sekule understood that if he was fair to other people, they would be fair to him.
