### Sekule’s Story (Part 1): Giving Up on God

_by Andrew McChesney_

Grandmother’s warnings about hell scared five-year-old Sekule. Grandmother warned Sekule, “You must be a good boy. If you are bad, you’ll end up in hell.”

The boy asked, “What do you mean ‘end up in hell’?”

Grandmother explained, “You’ll end up in everlasting fire. You’ll burn forever if you lie or steal. Then you will feel the hot flames always burning your body.”

Grandmother’s words made Sekule feel confused. On the one hand, Grandmother said that God is love. On the other hand, she said that if Sekule lied, he’d end up in hell. Sekule was afraid because he lied sometimes.

The boy didn’t know what to do. His parents couldn’t help him. They weren’t Christians. Grandmother was the only Christian in the village.

A little later, Sekule hid behind a bush when no one was looking. Then he scolded God. Sekule said, “I don’t know why people say You are love. You aren’t love. You’re a monster. Why did You make me if You only meant to burn me up in fire? Why should I have faith in You and not lie and do bad things when You are so mean and nasty? I can’t believe in You. I won’t believe in You. You are a monster.”

Sekule was done with God. He was only five years old and had no interest in knowing God at all.

Nine years later, when Sekule was 14, his parents sent him away to school in Sarajevo. Sarajevo is the capital city of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 700 boys went to the school. Sekule was the only boy at school who was from the country of Montenegro. Sekule felt that his classmates would accept him if he was a good fighter. Sekule got into a fight almost every day. If someone touched one of his ears, he fought them. (Sekule had very funny-looking ears. They stuck out the same as teacup handles from both sides of his head. So, everyone loved to touch his ears, which made Sekule very mad.)

Sekule got a knife scar on his hand after a terrible fight. Sekule also was a bully. When a younger boy got a food package from home, Sekule stuck the boy out a window and hung him upside down from his ankles until the boy gave him the package.

After three years at school, Sekule wanted to know if he could have a better life than fighting. He wondered if Grandmother told him the truth about God. But what was the truth? In Sarajevo, there were Muslims, Catholics, and Jews. Sekule wondered, “If there is only one God, why are there so many religions?” Sekule decided to study all religions to find the truth.
