### Sekule’s Story (Part 7): Skin and Bones

_by Andrew McChesney_

Sekule came back to army headquarters after digging coal on a mountain. Then Sekule went to see his commander. He told his commander that he refused to carry a gun in the war in Bosnia.

Sekule explained, “I don’t want to shoot people.”

The commander said, “You must carry a gun. If you refuse, then you must serve two years in the army instead of one year.”

Sekule answered, “I don’t care. I won’t carry a weapon.”

The commander sent Sekule to a special commander. Only soldiers who were in deep trouble were sent to the special commander. The special commander could send soldiers to prison.

Sekule explained his beliefs to the special commander.

The commander said, “Fine. Take a gun anyway. If you must fight, give the gun back. That way you will serve only one year and not two years.”

Sekule didn’t understand. “What do you mean?”

The commander explained, “Agree to carry a gun during training. The training you will get will be on how to type on a teleprinter. You will not be trained to kill people.” Sekule liked this plan. He was sent to work in the army’s communications office. Sekule’s job was typing on a teleprinter.

Because of the war, Sekule needed to finish his training quickly. But Sekule refused to go to training classes on the Sabbath. The army gave Sekule more trouble about his refusing to work on Sabbath than they did about his refusing to carry a gun.

Food was also a problem. The army food was made with lard or pig grease. Sekule’s parents refused to send him any money to buy food because they wanted him to get so hungry that he’d start eating meat.

Sekule prayed, “Lord, please bless me the same as You blessed Daniel. Daniel decided not to eat food that wasn’t clean. I want to do the same.”

Sekule’s commander didn’t know what to do with Sekule.

The commander asked, “You won’t work on Saturday?”

Sekule said, “No, sir.”

The commander asked, “You won’t eat meat?”

Sekule answered, “No, sir.”

The only thing Sekule could eat was bread and tea. In four months, he lost 50 pounds (23 kilograms). He weighed only 137 pounds (62 kilograms). He was skin and bones.
