### “I Fought and Won”

_by Andrew McChesney_

Pedro was surprised when his sister got angry with him after he came home from church. Pedro lived with his sister in the country of Mozambique in Africa. Pedro’s sister said, “Don’t go back to the Seventh-day Adventist Church, Pedro. It’s not a good church because it has false messengers. If you go again, you can’t live with me anymore.”

Pedro was worried. Family problems forced him to leave his home in the town of Beira to live with his sister. Pedro’s sister lived in Maputo, 700 miles (1,140 kilometers) from Beira. Maputo is the capital city of Mozambique. After Pedro moved to Maputo, he looked for a Seventh-day Adventist Church. Soon he found a church and worshiped there for the first time. When he got home, his sister told him not to go back there again.

Pedro prayed for his sister and kept going to church.

Pedro’s sister tried to force Pedro to stop going to church. She stopped sharing her food with Pedro. Pedro’s sister wanted to make her brother feel very hungry. She hoped he would agree to stop going to church to get some food from her.

Pedro thanked God for taking care of him. He kept going to church. Pedro got ready to go to church on Sabbath morning. His sister told him not to come back. She said, “Are you going to keep going to your church? If you refuse to obey my rules, you can’t live in my house anymore.”

Pedro was sad. He knew that he wasn’t fighting only with his sister. He was in the middle of a spiritual war between Jesus and Satan. Pedro remembered Paul’s words: “Our fight is not with people. It [our fight] is against the leaders and the powers [demons] and the spirits [the devil and his demons] of darkness [evil] in [on] this world [earth]. It [our fight] is against the demon world [Satan’s army of evil angels] that works in the heavens [where God lives]” (Ephesians 6:12, NLV).

Pedro went to church and asked the pastor and church members to pray for him. When Pedro went home later that day, his sister kicked him out. A friend let Pedro stay with him for two nights. Then a church member gave Pedro a job taking care of his house in exchange for meals and a room.

Today, Pedro continues to take care of people’s homes for a living. He worships God every Sabbath. He believes God is working on his sister’s heart. They are friends again. She no longer tells him to stop going to church on Sabbath. Pedro hopes that she will accept the whole Bible truth and learn to love the writings of Ellen G. White.

Pedro says, “I put on God’s battle suit. I fought and won. ‘I can do all things because Christ gives me the strength’ [Philippians 4:13, NLV].”
