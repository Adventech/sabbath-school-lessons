### Prayer Answered in Perth

_by Joe Peola_

Margaret and her husband, Levana, sat in their living room in Perth, Australia. The night before, they came home from a visit with her father in Papua New Guinea. Papua New Guinea is about 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers) away from the city of Perth.

Margaret was thinking about her father’s words to her at the airport yesterday. After Father prayed with her, he said, “Margaret, Jesus is coming back very soon. When you arrive at your home in Perth, my God will be at your door the next day.”

Not far from Levana and Margaret’s home, a Bible worker named Jo Laing prayed with several friends at a Seventh-day Adventist Church. Jo and her friends prayed for God to lead them in their work that day. Then they went out into the local neighborhood to sell books about the Bible and health.

A few hours later, Jo knocked on the door of Levana and Margaret’s home. Levana opened the door. He looked at the book that Jo showed him. But he wasn’t really interested in it. Then Jo gave him a copy of Ellen White’s _The Great Controversy_ and started to tell Levana about the book. Levana looked at several pages. Then he asked his wife to come to the door.

Levana asked Margaret, “Do we have this book?”

Margaret said that they did have the book. She turned to Jo and explained that she used to be a Seventh-day Adventist.

Margaret told Jo, “We just came home from Papua New Guinea last night. The last thing my dad said to me was that he would pray for God to show up at my house.”

That day in Perth was hot. The temperature outside was 109.5 degrees Fahrenheit (43 degrees Celsius). But Jo got goosebumps on her arms when she heard Margaret’s story. Then Jo and Margaret smiled at each other. The two women were amazed at how God answered the prayer of Margaret’s father.

Margaret said, “What if I came to your church and shared this story?”

Jo said, “That’s a wonderful idea.”

A few weeks later, Margaret stood with tears in her eyes at Bickley Seventh-day Adventist Church. Margaret told the church members about how God searched for her, the same as a lost lamb. When God found her, He brought her back to church.

God used a woman named Jo, with a copy of _The Great Controversy_, to answer a father’s prayer in Papua New Guinea.
