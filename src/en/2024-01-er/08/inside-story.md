### Sekule’s Story (Part 4): Sabbath Goodbye Party

_by Andrew McChesney_

Two weeks after Sekule was baptized, the Bosnian War started. Then Sekule ran away from his high school in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Sekule hid for 15 days. When Sekule went back to school, he discovered that soldiers burned the building where he lived. The soldiers dumped Sekule’s religious books in the middle of his room. Then they set the books on fire. Sekule lost everything he owned. So, he went back home to his village in Montenegro.

Sekule’s family heard the news that he joined the Seventh-day Adventist Church. His family was not happy with his decision. Father didn’t understand why Sekule stopped eating meat. Father took him to a doctor to get him some help. Mother thought that a witch put a curse on her son. So, she went to get help for her son from someone who practiced black magic. When the doctor and the magician failed to help Sekule, his parents sent Sekule to the army. The year was 1992. The Bosnian War was happening. In those days, when a family signed up their son for the army, that was the same as their sending him to war.

Back then, families gave big parties for soldiers who joined the army. Sekule’s parents planned his party for a Sabbath in December. Two hundred guests were expected to come. But Sekule went to church.

When the winter sun set at around 4 p.m., Sekule came home. He didn’t know what to expect. He thought the house would be filled with family members from all over the country and elsewhere. Sekule knew his family would be angry at him for arriving late to his own party and for not showing respect. He was the oldest grandson in his family.

Sekule found Grandfather on the front porch.

Sekule asked him, “Did the people come?”

Grandfather shook his head. “No.”

“Why not?” Sekule wondered.

His grandfather said, “No one knows.”

Just then people started coming. Sekule asked them, “Why are you coming now?”

Everyone answered the same way: “Somebody told us to come after 5 p.m.”

Sekule asked, “Who told you?”

No one knew. That’s when Sekule understood that God would protect him when he went into the army.
