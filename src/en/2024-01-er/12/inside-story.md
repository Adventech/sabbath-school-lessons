### Sekule’s Story (Part 8): No Hair, but a Hat

_by Andrew McChesney_

Sekule was a Seventh-day Adventist in the army. He soon learned about two other Sabbath-keeping soldiers. One soldier was an assistant commander. The war in Bosnia was happening at that time. The assistant commander tried to convince Sekule that they could break some of God’s rules because they were in hard times: “We’re in a war. You must eat the food you can get. You can practice your religion after you leave the army. But now you need to eat army food to stay healthy.”

Sekule decided that the assistant commander wasn’t really an Adventist in his heart. The assistant commander talked the same as Sekule’s parents, who weren’t Christians!

Sekule wanted to meet the other Sabbath-keeping soldier. This soldier was born in an Adventist home. A little later, Sekule was in the army’s dining room. One of the soldiers pointed to the other Seventh-day Adventist man. Sekule watched as the man sat down with a plate of pork sausages and brown beans. The beans were fried in lard. The man removed the sausages from his plate, then ate the beans.

Sekule thought, “See? That man is Adventist, and he eats food that’s not clean. Am I stupid? I’ve lost so much weight. I don’t have strength because I won’t eat army food. That man is smart. When you leave the army, you can follow God.”

Sekule stepped into the cafeteria line. He wasn’t just hungry. He was starved after eating only bread with tea for 20 days!

A few steps from the food, Sekule stopped. He thought, “I won’t eat this food. Jesus died for me. I’ll stay loyal to Him.”

A few months later, spring arrived. Sekule was so hungry. So, he ate some of the new leaves growing on the trees. He also ate grass that he learned in childhood was safe to eat.

Four months after Sekule became a soldier, he left army headquarters to eat his first real meal. A Seventh-day Adventist pastor invited him to his home for dinner.

Not long after, the army sent Sekule to Serbia’s capital, Belgrade. In Belgrade, Sekule served the army’s top general. Sekule’s new job was near an Adventist college. So, Sekule went to the college almost every day to eat vegetarian meals.

Sekule had good health in the army. He never got sick. He only lost his hair. He jokes that he joined the army with hair and left with none! He says, “It’s as if God said, ‘Be loyal to Me, and I will take care of you. Yes, you will have problems. Yes, you lost your hair. But don’t worry. I have a hat for you.”
