### Sekule’s Story (Part 2): Invited to Church

_by Andrew McChesney_

17-year-old Sekule was a high school student in Sarejevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Sekule wanted to know Bible truth. So, he started to visit different churches. But he didn’t find answers to his questions about why a loving God would burn someone in hell forever. So, Sekule decided to read the Bible and discover the truth for himself. He started with the New Testament.

Then summer came. Sekule went home to his village in the country of Montenegro. When he got home, he read one Bible book each day. On the first day, he read the 28 chapters of Matthew. The next day, he read the whole book of Mark. Then he read Luke, John, Acts, and Romans. Sekule read one book a day.

As Sekule continued to read the New Testament, he got answers to some of his questions. But Sekule wanted more information. He visited several more churches and the houses of worship from other religions. But he didn’t visit a Seventh-day Adventist Church. Sekule heard many terrible stories about Seventh-day Adventists. He thought, “Those people are crazy. They can’t have the truth.”

Sekule went back to school. He continued to visit different churches and houses of worship. But he didn’t find answers in the many houses of worship he visited. In the end, Sekule decided that God wasn’t real. So, he stopped reading the Bible.

Then a high-school teacher saw Sekule’s Bible. The teacher was a Seventh-day Adventist. She and some other teachers were searching the rooms of the students to see if they were hiding alcohol or drugs.

The teacher said to Sekule, “You have a Bible!”

Sekule nodded. “Yes.”

His teacher asked him, “What have you learned?”

Sekule answered, “Many things.”

The teacher asked Sekule about the book of Daniel. Sekule remembered everything he read. He answered her questions.

His teacher was surprised. “You understand the Book of Daniel well! You’re the first person I’ve met who understands. You must come to the Seventh-day Adventist Church.”

Sekule was afraid to refuse her invitation. She was his ­teacher. He was afraid she would give him a bad grade if he didn’t go.

He said, “OK, I’ll go.” But he lied. He really had no plans to go to her church.
