  title: "The Book of Psalms"
  description: "The Book of Psalms is a collection of prayers and hymns. These prayers and hymns are also poems. They are the most beautiful poems ever written. The poems in the Book of Psalms talk about different human feelings and topics: praise, joy, sorrow, and suffering. These poems or songs were read or sung in public or private. Who read or sang them? Kings, poets, and priests or spiritual leaders sang them. So did sinners who confessed their sins and gave their lives back to God. People the same as you and me sang or read these songs and poems, too. God’s people have used the Book of Psalms for their prayers and songs since Old Testament times."
