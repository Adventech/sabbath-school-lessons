### Finding Jesus in a Holy Book

_by Andrew McChesney_

Paul went from house to house in a big city in Europe. He carried both a Bible and the holy book from another religion. Paul knocked on the door of a house. A man opened the door. His breath smelled of cigarette smoke.

Paul said, “I want to give you a gift today.”

The man asked, “What gift?”

Paul answered, “I have this Bible.”

The man said, “I don’t want a Bible. I belong to a different religion. You are a Christian.”

Paul nodded. “I have your religion’s holy book, too.”

The man was surprised and interested. He said, “OK. Read to me from my holy book. Don’t read me anything from the Bible.”

Paul opened the man’s holy book and read about Jesus. The man grew more surprised. He asked, “Is this the same Jesus who is also in the Bible?”

During the next few weeks, the man studied four lessons about Jesus from his holy book. His religion’s holy book didn’t talk about Jesus’ death on the cross. But his holy book did say that Jesus will come again. The man saw that both people from his religion and Christians waited for Jesus to come back.

When Paul arrived for the fifth lesson, the man wasn’t home.

A year passed. Then the man showed up at Paul’s church.

The man said, “I want to come to your church. Can I?”

Now Paul was surprised.

The man added, “I want to follow Jesus.”

After that day, the man came to church every Sabbath. The man told Paul that his religion’s holy book left him feeling empty inside. His holy book did not talk about a Savior for his sins. Now the man wanted to get baptized.

Paul said, “Jesus says that the human body is the same as God’s temple. Do you want to be made free from cigarettes? Jesus says, ‘So if the Son [Jesus] makes you free, you are really free’ [John 8:36, ERV]. You must choose Jesus or cigarettes. You can throw away your cigarettes today if you choose.”

The man looked scared. He said, “It’s not possible!” But then he reached into his pocket and threw his cigarette pack into the trash. He prayed, “Jesus, I want You to make me free.”

Late that night, the man called Paul on the phone. He said, “I feel awful. I can’t live without cigarettes. Help me!”

The two men prayed on the phone. God heard their prayer and gave the man His strength to win the fight against cigarettes. The man hasn’t smoked since that time, four years ago. Today, the man is a leader in the Adventist Church.

Paul says, “This man loves people. He is waiting for Jesus to come back.”
