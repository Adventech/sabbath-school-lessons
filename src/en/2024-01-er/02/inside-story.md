### Radostin’s Cry for Help

_by Andrew McChesney_

Radostin hated his life. His friends were bad people. Worse, sometimes Radostin sold drugs to make money. He broke the law in other ways, too. But he wanted to change. He cried out, “I want to change how I live.”

Radostin grew older and got married. He and his wife had two sons. Times were hard. Radostin left Bulgaria, his homeland, to look for work in another country. He found a job in Western Europe. In his new life, Radostin wanted to know Bible truth. Radostin wanted friends who could teach him about the Bible. He wondered, “How can people who know Bible truth find me?”

After some time, Radostin moved again to find a better job. Six weeks later, he was all alone in a small, rented room with no money or food. He was very, very hungry. That night, Radostin prayed for the first time in his life. He said, “God help me.”

In the morning, someone knocked on Radostin’s door. When Radostin opened the door, he saw a man in a suit standing there. The man held a Bible in his hand. Radostin understood that God sent the man in answer to his cry for help.

The man was named Paul. Paul brought food for Radostin. Then Paul invited Radostin to his church. Radostin went and was surprised. For the first time in his life, Radostin felt God’s love in a church. God touched Radostin’s heart. Radostin wept.

Radostin went home to Bulgaria. He told his family about meeting God at the church of his new friend, Paul. Radostin wanted to go back to the church. But he wasn’t sure his wife would agree to move. Both Radostin and his wife had grown up in a worldwide religion that was different from Christianity.

Radostin prayed, “God, if it is Your plan, if You are God, help. If Paul’s church is Your true church, send my family and me there. I want a total change in my life.”

Later, Radostin’s wife announced, “I don’t want to live in Bulgaria. I want to live in the same city as Paul’s church.” Radostin knew his wife’s words were an answer to prayer. God wanted Radostin and his family to move. Radostin knew that his wife wanted to know God, too. So, the family moved.

Today, Radostin is a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. He goes to his friend Paul’s church every Sabbath.Times are hard now for Radostin as they were in the past. But he has faith in God. Radostin says, “We don’t pray for God to give us everything. We pray that He will protect us from evil. We ask God to help us and give us strength when times are hard.”

Radostin knows that God hears his prayers. God heard his cry for help. Radostin says, “I wasn’t a good person when I was young. Praise God, He really changed my heart!”
