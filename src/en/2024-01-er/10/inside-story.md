### Sekule’s Story (Part 6): No Work, No Food

_by Andrew McChesney_

Sekule joined the army. He refused to work on the Sabbath because he was a Seventh-day Adventist. After Sekule refused to work on several Sabbaths, Sekule’s commander soon knew that he couldn’t force Sekule to break God’s law or do anything he believed was wrong.

The commander said, “So, you really can’t work on the Sabbath in the army?”

Sekule answered, “Yes I can’t work during that time.”

The commander said, “If you’re not working, you don’t need to eat. Eating is working. Also, some of the food is cooked on your Sabbath. So, you shouldn’t eat it.”

At that time, Sekule was eating only bread and drinking only tea because the rest of the army food was made with lard or pork grease. Sekule agreed not to eat bread or drink tea made on the Sabbath. Sekule was a new Seventh-day Adventist. So, he wasn’t sure if he could, or couldn’t, eat food made on the Sabbath. But Sekule needed to give his commander an answer that he could understand. What if Sekule refused to work on the Sabbath, but asked for bread and tea? Then his commander would think Sekule was not loyal to God.

Several months passed. Then the army cooks started to cook one meal each week without any lard or pig grease. That was the only meal that Sekule could eat. But the cooks made and served the meal on the Sabbath.

Sekule prayed, “God, please, please, could You change the day that the cooks make the lard-free meal from Sabbath to Sunday? Will You do that for me?”

Sekule prayed for a month, and the lard-free meal was moved to Sunday.

The army gave the soldiers Sundays off. Sunday was the only time during the week when the soldiers relaxed. They played football, basketball, and other sports. Sekule wished that the soldier’s day off was on the Sabbath. Sekule knew he could refuse to play soccer on the Sabbath much more easily than he could refuse to work on the Sabbath.

Sekule prayed again. “Lord, I’m sorry to be so much trouble, but could I ask You one more favor? Could You move our day off in the army from Sunday to Sabbath? Then I won’t need to explain to everyone why I can’t work every Sabbath.”

A week later, the solders’ day off was moved from Sunday to Saturday.
