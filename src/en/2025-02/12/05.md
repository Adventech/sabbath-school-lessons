It’s not just the Old Testament that gives us precursors to final events; the New Testament does, as well. Life was not easy for first-century Christians. They were hated by many of their own fellow religionists, who saw them as a threat to the faith of Moses. They also faced the wrath of the pagan Roman Empire. “The powers of earth and hell arrayed themselves against Christ in the person of His followers. Paganism foresaw that should the gospel triumph, her temples and altars would be swept away; therefore she summoned her forces to destroy Christianity. The fires of persecution were kindled.”—Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy, p. 39.

There is a story in the book of Acts that demonstrates, quite powerfully, what God’s people might expect as we head toward the scenario found in Revelation 13.

`Read Acts 12:1–17. What elements of this story might foreshadow last-day events?`

James had been beheaded, and Peter was to be next; there was a death penalty against Christians. Perhaps one of the most remarkable aspects of this story can be found in the fact that Peter is _sleeping_ on what should be the worst night of his life—so soundly that the angel actually has to strike him to wake him up!

Peter, of course, was miraculously set free and found his way to a meeting of believers who had trouble believing that he had really been delivered, even though they had been praying. The Bible says they were _astonished_—which makes one wonder how often we pray and scarcely dare to believe that God will actually answer us.

Some believers were spared; others were killed. As we approach the end time, the same thing will happen. Even Peter, though spared then, eventually died for his faith. Jesus Himself even told him how: “ ‘Most assuredly, I say to you, when you were younger, you girded yourself and walked where you wished; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish.’ This He spoke, signifying by what death he would glorify God. And when He had spoken this, He said to him, ‘Follow Me’ ” (John 21:18, 19, NKJV).

`Notice that Jesus, after telling Peter how he would die, nevertheless still says to him, “ ‘Follow Me.’ ” What should this tell us about why even the threat of death should not keep us from following the Lord?`
