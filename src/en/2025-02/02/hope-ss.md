### Part #2 The Genesis Foundation

**Scripture Song:** Let the word of Christ – Colossians 3:16

Welcome to Hope Sabbath School—an in-depth interactive study of the Word of God. We are continuing our series of studies on Bible Prophecies and Stories for the Last Days. Today’s topic: **The Genesis Foundation.**

- **The principle of “First Mention”**
	- How does the principle of “First Mention” help us in our study of Bible prophecy? Compare Isaiah 40:7-8 with Matthew 5:17-18 and Hebrews 13:8
	- How does the first mention of “love” in the Bible in the story of Abraham and Isaac help us to understand the more complete revelation of God’s love found throughout the Bible? Genesis 22:1-13? (see also Hebrews 11:17-19)
	- Why is the first mention of “love” in the Gospel of John such an important revelation? John 3:16?

- **The Lamb in Bible prophecy**
	- Where is the first mention of a lamb in the Bible? Genesis 22:7-8 (alluded to though not mentioned by name in Genesis 4:4)
	- How does the story of the Passover help us to understand God’s plan of salvation? Exodus 12:3-13
	- What is the significance of the declarations of John the Baptist recorded in John 1:29-36?
	- Read the first mention of the Lamb in the Book of Revelation (5:6-13). How does our study of the lamb in Bible prophecy help us to understand this dramatic scene in heaven?
	- What is your personal response when you consider all the Lamb of God has provided for your salvation?

- **The reason for death**
	- How can we be certain death was not part of God’s original plan for the human family? Genesis 1:27-28,31
	- How does the first mention of dying in the book of Genesis help us to understand the reason for death? Genesis 2:15-17 (see also Romans 6:23a)
	- What was the role of the Serpent in bringing death to our world? Genesis 3:1-5, Revelation 12:7-9, John 8:44
	- What painful encounter with death did our first parents experience after they had sinned by disobeying God’s command? Genesis 4:1-15
	- How did the disobedience of our first parents impact the entire human family? Romans 5:12-21
	- How has death impacted you personally?

- **Death’s ultimate defeat**
	- What important revelation was given to the Apostle John about the ultimate defeat of death? Revelation 1:12-18, 20:14
	- How can we experience victory over death caused by sin? John 3:16, 6:40, 11:25, etc.
	- How has your faith in Jesus as your personal Savior given you freedom from fear of death? (Psalm 34:4, 1 John 4:18, etc.)
