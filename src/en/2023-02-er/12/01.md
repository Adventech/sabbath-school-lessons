### Read for This Week’s Study
Revelation 13:5; 2 Thessalonians 2:3, 4, 9–12; Revelation 17:12–14, Revelation 14:9; Exodus 20:8–11.

> <p>Memory Text</p>
> “Anyone who puts people in prison will go to prison. Anyone who kills others with a long knife or sword will be killed by a long knife or sword. This is why God’s people are patient and keep on believing” (Revelation 13:10, WE).

In the 1400s, a group of people lived high in the mountains in northern Italy. These people were named the Waldenses. The Waldenses were loyal to Bible truth. The leaders of the Roman Catholic Church attacked the Waldenses for their faith. In a.d. 1488, the Roman Catholic Church attacked and killed the Waldenses in the Valley of Loyse.

Two hundred years later, the Roman Catholic Church attacked the Waldenses again. The Duke of Savoy sent an army of 8,000 soldiers to the Waldenses. The Duke ordered the Waldenses to feed and house his troops in their homes. But this plan was just a trick. The duke wanted his soldiers to pretend to be guests so that they could kill everyone. On April 24, 1655, at 4:00 a.m.a.m., the duke’s army killed more than 4,000 innocent people while they slept.

Sad to say, the same things happen in history again and again. The two marks of Revelation 13 show us that Rome’s attacks on God’s church in the past will happen again.
