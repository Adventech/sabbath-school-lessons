> “ ‘Our Lord and God! You are worthy to receive [get] glory and honor and power [control]. You made all things. Everything existed [is alive] and was made because you wanted it’ ” (Revelation 4:11, ERV).

How often do we stop and ask the important question, “How did we get here on this planet?”

This question often will lead us to ask another important question: Who made this earth and all the wonderful things on it? But what if we weren’t here? What if the earth and everything in it and all the stars and planets in outer space never were made? Many scientists say that there was a time when there were no stars, planets, or suns and moons. These scientists say there wasn’t even outer space. Also, these scientists say that life started from nothing. So, they think that it’s a miracle that life happened on this planet at all.

We know that these ideas are false teachings. The stars and planets in outer space didn’t come from nothing. Life didn’t start from nothing. The Bible teaches us that God made everything there is. God made the sun, the moon, the stars, and all the planets in outer space. God made this earth and all the life on it, too.
