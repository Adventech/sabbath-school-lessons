> “I was [given the task] to make all men understand the meaning of this secret. God kept this secret to Himself from the beginning of the world [the earth]. And He is the One Who made all things” (Ephesians 3:9, NLV).

God made each one of us. So, every person has worth. The baby inside its mother, the teenager in the wheelchair, and the grandmother who can’t remember her own name: all these people have worth in God’s eyes. God is their Father. These persons are His sons and daughters. “ ‘He is the God who made the world. He also made everything in it. He is the Lord of heaven and earth. He doesn’t live in temples built by human hands. . . . From one man he made all the people of [in] the world [on the earth]. Now they live all over the earth’ ” (Acts 17:24, 26, NIrV).

Every person on the earth belongs to the same family. We are brothers and sisters made by the same God. The Genesis story (Genesis 1 and 2) shows us how much we really are worth. What’s more, each one of us is special. There’s no one else who is an exact copy of you anywhere. You are worth so much to God that He was born as a human and died on the cross for you and your sins!
