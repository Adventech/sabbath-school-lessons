### Moving the Two-Day Weekend

Rene lost two jobs because of his faith in the Seventh-day Adventist religion. Rene, who lived in the Philippines, asked God for help. Rene prayed, “Lord, it looks as if being a Seventh-day Adventist is only for the rich. I can’t find a job that lets me have my Sabbaths off. How can I support my family?”

Rene studied to be an accountant when he was in college. But now he took whatever work he could find. He took jobs with building companies. But the pay wasn’t enough to feed his growing family. He now was the father of two young children. Rene prayed again, “God, can You help me find a job that will support my family?”

Then Rene saw an ad for an accounting job in the Middle East. He would need to leave his family in the Philippines. Rene got the job. When he arrived, he learned that the weekend in that country was on Thursday and Friday. So, people must work on Sabbath and Sunday.

Rene’s boss made him go into the office on Saturdays. But Rene didn’t need to do any work. So, he read the Bible and Ellen White’s writings. But he felt bad. He was at work on Sabbath. He felt as if he were doing something wrong. He wanted to go to church on Sabbath. Rene prayed. “Lord, if You help me to go to church, I will keep the Sabbath holy until I die.”

For two years, Rene prayed this prayer. Then he talked with his boss.

Rene said, “Please give me Saturdays off for my Sabbath rest.”

Rene’s boss said, “No, I can’t allow that.” But his boss did make Rene a promise. “If my king announces that he will change the weekend to Friday and Saturday, then you are free to rest.”

Rene prayed, “Lord, You heard what my boss said. Will You please help?”

Three months later, Rene’s boss was in Europe when the king signed a law to move the country’s weekend to Friday and Saturday. Rene never stopped praying during this time. But Rene didn’t hear the news. He went to the office as usual at nine o’clock on Saturday morning. He sat down and checked his email. Then he saw the message from his boss. The message said, “Rene, I heard the news from my king. I remember my promise to you. You are free to rest if my king announces Friday and Saturday to be the weekend.” Rene closed the office and went to church. He was so happy he cried.
