### Stolen Bible Starts a Church

_by David Fletcher_

In 2021, in Papua New Guinea, people from five villages started to fight each other. Many houses were burned. In one village, named Kemefa, the fighters stole many things. At least 16 people were killed.

During this time, a fighter entered the Kemefa Seventh-day Adventist Church and stole a Bible. The fighter, Abuni Ane, took the book to his home village, Orege.

After the fights ended, Abuni started to read the stolen Bible. As he read, his heart was touched.

Many months passed. A Seventh-day Adventist pastor named Dicks Neheza visited Abuni’s village. Abuni brought the stolen Bible to the pastor and explained what happened. Abuni was sorry for stealing the Bible. He wanted to give his life to God.

The pastor and Abuni started a house church in Orege. Before long, Abuni decided to get baptized.

At the baptism, Abuni shared his story with the people who came from the Kemefa church. Abuni asked for their forgiveness and gave the Bible to the church’s leader.

The church leader forgave Abuni and asked him to keep the Bible. Then the leader gave Abuni a church songbook as a gift. The leader encourage Abuni to keep reading the Bible, to sing hymns to God, and to start a church in Orege.

Abuni went right to work. The next day, he and two friends went into the jungle to collect wood to build a church. Pastor Neheza bought tools to build the church. The church opened that same day in Orege with three members.

Since then, the church now has 18 members. Eight people were baptized during a Bible meeting in 2024.

Pastor Neheza is amazed that fighting between people in different villages and a stolen Bible started a new church! The pastor said that their church is now too small. Church members now plan to build a bigger church.
