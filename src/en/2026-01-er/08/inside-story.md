### Losing Two Jobs Because of Religion

Rodel won Rene to Jesus because he took him fishing.

Ellen G. White says, “Jesus’ plan is the only plan that will give us real success in touching people’s hearts. The Savior made friends with people. He wanted what was best for them. He showed people that He cared. He helped them and took care of their needs. Jesus won their hearts. Then He invited them to ‘Follow Me.’ ”—The Ministry of Healing, page 143, adapted.

After Rene gave his heart back to Jesus, Rodel asked if he could stay at Rene’s house. Rene’s parents weren’t too happy about having the young Seventh-day Adventist living in their home in the Philippines. But they didn’t say no. During this time, Rodel encouraged Rene to go back to school. Rene did.

Rodel said, “I’m waiting for you to finish school. Then we can go to Manila to be Bible workers in the 1000 Missionary Movement.” Rodel served as a Bible worker in the 1000 Missionary Movement when he first met Rene about a year and a half earlier.

While Rene studied, Rodel lived with him and helped pay for his studies. They worked together in the rice fields. Rene finished school when he was 23.

Rodel kept his promise. Rodel took Rene to the headquarters of the 1000 Missionary Movement in Silang, near the Philippine capital, Manila. But then Rodel had another idea. He said Rene should continue his education before becoming a Bible worker. The two men studied at the Adventist University of the Philippines in Silang. Rene studied to become an accountant. Rodel studied religion. Rene finished college after six years. His parents didn’t help him pay for his education. During that time, Rene married Love Jhoie.

After Rene finished school, he worked as an ac­countant for three months. The company fired Rene because he wouldn’t work on Friday nights. Rene trusted God’s promise in Jeremiah 29:11: “ ‘I know what I have planned for you,’ says the Lord. ‘I have good plans for you. I don’t plan to hurt you. I plan to give you hope and a good future’ ” (Jeremiah 29:11, ICB).

Months passed. Then a hospital gave Rene a job as an accountant. But then Rene learned that he must get baptized in the church that owned the hospital. That church was not the Seventh-day Adventist Church. So, Rene quit his job.

Rene Tucaldo is the accounting manager for the 1000 Missionary Movement, in Silang, Philippines. The headquarters were built with the help of a 13th Sabbath Offering, in 1996. Read more next week.
