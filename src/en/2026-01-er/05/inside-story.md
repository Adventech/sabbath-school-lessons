### No Devil Connection

_by Olivia Fairfax_

The people at Marovo Lake loved to fight and eat people. They lived in the Solomon Islands. The Marovo Lake people loved to fight and eat people more than anyone else in the Solomon Islands. The Marovo Lake people worshiped the spirits of their dead family members. The Marovo Lake people kept the skulls of their dead family members, too. They also were very afraid of the devil.

Around 1902, a Marovo leader named Tatagu wondered if he really needed to fear the devil. He decided to learn the truth. Tatagu decided not to tie a vine to the front of his canoe on a fishing trip. People believed that vines brought good luck and many fish, and protected them from the devil’s anger. Tatagu’s trip without the vine was a big success. When Tatagu came home, he was told some more good news. He had a new baby son. Tatagu named the boy Kata Ragoso, which means “no devil connection.” God used Kata Ragoso to change a community and remove the devil’s control over people.

Kata Ragoso grew up at a time when dishonest European traders tricked people from the Solomon Islands to get on their ships. The traders kidnapped these Solomon Islanders and made them slaves. But in 1914, when Kata Ragoso was 12, a small white boat named the Advent Herald sailed into Marovo Lake. The sailors didn’t try to kidnap the Marovo people. Captain Griffiths F. Jones asked Tatagu for land to build a school. The next year, a school was built at Sasaghana. Kata Ragoso was one of 23 students who went to the school. At the school, Kata Ragoso accepted Jesus. In 1918, Kata Ragoso was one of the first 10 Solomon Islanders to get baptized. Then Kata Ragoso worked as a teacher. He also translated Bible books into his people’s language. Kata Ragoso also was a print shop mana­ger. In 1935, he became a Seventh-day Adventist pastor.

During World War II, Kata Ragoso became the manager of the Seventh-day Adventist work in the Solomon Islands. When the Japanese entered the islands with force, they ordered Kata Ragoso to kill people with white skin. Kata Ragoso refused to obey. The Japanese soldiers beat him. The officer in charge told his soldiers to kill Kata Ragoso when he counted to three. The officer counted, “One, two . . .” He tried very hard, but he couldn’t say three. Finally, he gave up. After 10 days in prison, Kata Ragoso escaped. For the rest of the war, he helped save soldiers whose planes or ships were attacked. Kata Ragoso saved 27 US pilots and 187 Australian and New Zealand soldiers. Kata Ragoso died in 1964, at age 62. He served the church for 37 years. During that time, he saw God change the Marova people from lovers of war into lovers of God.
