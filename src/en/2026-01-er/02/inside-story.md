### A Messenger From God

Oscar stood still and prayed as three dogs barked at him outside a house in Kenya. The owner let the dogs out when he saw Oscar approach the house. The owner came over to Oscar. The man asked, “Who are you?”

Oscar said, “I’m a messenger from God.”

The man asked, “What message did God send you with?”

Oscar said, “His message. May I come in?”

The man ordered the dogs to stop barking and tied them up. Then the man invited Oscar into his house.

Oscar said, “Let’s pray.” The man didn’t close his eyes. Oscar prayed. Then he started to talk about the first five books of Moses, named the Pentateuch. The man wasn’t a Christian. He belonged to a non-Christian worldwide religion. But the man knew those books of the law. The man asked many questions. The two men became friends. Today, the man and his wife are Seventh-day Adventists.

Another time, a homeowner told Oscar he was ­interested in the Bible lessons that Oscar offered. The man sent his three children into the other room to play. The children were ages 6, 8, and 13. As they left the room, Oscar saw that they limped with pain. Oscar said, “Ask the children to come back, so we can pray for them.” Then Oscar saw that the children had tiny insects crawling on their skin. These insects cause terrible skin rashes and pain. Oscar prayed for the children. Then he left to buy medicine.

The family thought that evil magic was making their children sick, and not the insects. When Oscar came back, he helped the family clean their house and blankets. Then he told the parents to bathe the children and give them the medi­cine. Oscar prayed for them. Then Oscar studied the Bible with the parents. Later, the family became Seventh-day Adventist. They sold some of their land to build a new Seventh-day Adventist church.

Oscar also visits Sunday-keeping churches to share the Good News about Jesus. A Sunday-church leader invited Oscar to preach in his church. But when the leader learned that Oscar was Seventh-day Adventist, the man refused to allow Oscar to preach. Oscar stayed for the meeting anyway. As he left, he saw many of his neighbors. He went to greet them.

Oscar said, “Do not wait for the pastor to come teach you. I have lessons you can study yourself.”

7 people accepted the Bible lessons right away. A few people didn’t. But later on, they agreed to study the lessons. Today, 43 people from the Sunday church are studying the Bible with Oscar. Oscar says, “Not bad for a meeting where I wasn’t allowed to preach!”
