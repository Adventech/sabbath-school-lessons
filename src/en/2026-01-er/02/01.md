### Read for This Week’s Lesson

Philippians 1:3–18; 1 Corinthians 13:1–8; Colossians 1:3–12; Colossians 1:6, 23.

> <p>Memory Verse</p>
> “God began to do a good work in you. And I am sure that he will keep on doing it until he has finished it. He will keep on until the day Jesus Christ comes again” (Philippians 1:6, WE).

Paul starts his letters with words of greeting and thanks­giving. “I pray that God, our Father, will continue to help you. I pray that he will give you peace in your minds. We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you” (Colossians 1:2, 3, EASY).

We, too, have much to be thankful for. We thank God for His mercy. Angels in heaven can’t begin to understand our amazing experience with God’s mercy. We also thank God for His gifts of peace, hope, and love.

As humans, we can show other people that we thank God for the things they do for us. We hope that they also will thank God for the things we do for them, too. Parents pray that their children will love God. Parents also pray that their children someday will thank God for their happy times with their families.

This week, we will study Paul’s opening words in his letters to the churches in Philippi and in Colossae. These words are filled with thanksgiving and prayer. May these words make our own prayer life strong.
