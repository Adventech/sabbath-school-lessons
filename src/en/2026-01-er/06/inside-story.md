### Unexpected Church Visit

Gilbert Fimaka woke up on a Sunday and wanted to go to church.

Gilbert was a 22-year-old medical missionary in Zambia. A medical missionary is a Bible worker who teaches people about the Seventh-day Adventist health message and natural healing. Gilbert told his roommate what he wanted to do. Gilbert’s roommate also was a medical missionary. Gilbert and his roommate just finished up a three-week trip to do medical missionary work out in the country in Zambia.

Gilbert said, “I want to visit a church here before we leave. I want to share the Bible with the church members and tell them about the seventh-day Sabbath.”

Then Gilbert laughed at his plan. His roommate laughed, too. The idea was crazy! But in his heart, Gilbert wanted to go. So, he went. Gilbert went to the church nearest to the place where he lived. As he entered the church, he felt nervous. He knew he couldn’t just announce, “Sunday is not the day of worship.”

To Gilbert’s surprise, the church members made him feel welcome. Many members knew Gilbert from this medical missionary work. They welcomed him with warm hearts. They gave him a seat of honor with the church leaders.

Then it was time for the sermon. To Gilbert’s surprise, he was invited to preach. He got up to talk, but he was afraid to talk about the Sabbath. So, he opened his Bible to the book of Job.

As Gilbert preached, he heard a voice say in his heart, “Talk about the Sabbath.” Gilbert didn’t pay attention to the voice. He continued preaching. The voice told him the same thing again. When the voice talked to him a third time, Gilbert turned in his Bible to Leviticus 23:3. He read, “Work for six days, but the seventh day, the Sabbath, will be a special day of rest, a holy meeting. You must not do any work. It [the Sabbath] is a day of rest to honor the Lord in all your homes” (ERV). Then Gilbert read Matthew 28:1 and Genesis 2:1–3.

Gilbert said, “The seventh day is not Sunday, but Saturday. So, the real day of worship is Saturday, and not Sunday.”

When Gilbert finished the sermon, a church leader stood up and announced, “I will stop worshiping on Sunday. From now on, I will worship only on Saturday.”

On their way out of the church, many members talked about the sermon. Some members were crying. One member said, “We didn’t know that we were worshiping on the wrong day.” Someone else said, “From now on, we will worship on Saturday.”

A short time later, the church leader got baptized in a Seventh-day Adventist church. Many other church members started to study the Bible so they, too, could get baptized.
