### Read for This Week’s Lesson

Philippians 3:17–21; 1 Corinthians 15:42–44; John 14:27; 1 Corinthians 14:33; Philippians 4:4–13, 19.

> <p>Memory Verse</p>
> “Do not worry about anything. But pray and ask God for everything you need. And when you pray, always give thanks” (Philippians 4:6, ICB).

This week, we will finish our study about Paul’s letter to the Philippians. Paul’s letter to the Philippians is filled with valuable lessons, advice, and sayings for daily living. Paul included many of these sayings in the final verses of his letter. Paul’s words are similar to the teachings of Jesus. Jesus taught His followers how to have a happy, faith-filled life. Paul also tells us how to live a joyful Christian life.

Often things happen in life that we don’t like. But we don’t need to worry. The Bible gives us many important rules to help us stay strong and solve our problems. So, we don’t need to worry. We can let God fill us with peace. God gives us this precious peace. He controls the future. He controls our lives now. He will give us everything we need.

Most important, we don’t need to depend on governments or their leaders to give us hope or peace. As Christians, we are part of the family of heaven. As members of God’s kingdom, God gives us many blessings. God also expects us to serve Him, too.
