### Wanting to Be a Rich Seventh-day Adventist

Little Rene liked everything about Seventh-day Adventists. Rene was born in the Philippines and grew up there. All rich people were Seventh-day Adventists in Rene’s town. The Seventh-day Adventists had big rice farms. They had good lives. Rene wanted a good life, too.

Some Seventh-day Adventist children invited Rene to read the Bible with them. Then the son of his dad’s boss invited Rene to Sabbath School and church. The boss was a Seventh-day Adventist rice farmer. At church, Rene learned about the Sabbath. Rene also saw that the Seventh-day Adventist children wore nice clothes. Rene liked that the children didn’t use cuss words. Rene wanted to be the same as they were.

When Rene was 12, he was baptized and joined the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Rene didn’t get rich. His life got worse. His family hated his religion. They stopped supporting his studies. Rene was forced to quit school. Four years later, when Rene was 16, he left the church and joined his father in the rice fields of the Seventh-day Adventist farmer. Soon he was drinking, smoking, gambling, and eating meat that wasn’t clean.

Two years later, a 17-year old named Rodel knocked on Rene’s door. Rene’s mother answered.

Rodel said, “I’m a Bible worker. May I come in?”

Mother asked, “What’s your religion?”

Rodel said, “I am a Seventh-day Adventist Bible worker.”

Mother said, “Ah. My son is Seventh-day Adventist, too. But he stopped going to church.”

Rodel asked, “Where is he?”

Mother answered, “He’s sleeping.”

After working all day in the rice fields, Rene was very tired. Mother led Rodel to him.

Rodel said, “My friend, why did you stop being a Seventh-day Adventist?”

Rene was surprised. But he said he wasn’t going back to church. He said, “My family hated my religion.”

Rodel asked, “Will you come with me to church?”

Rene said, “I don’t think so. I can’t go.”

Rodel left. But a year and a half later, when Rene was 20, Rodel came back.

Rodel said, “My friend, let’s go fishing.” Rodel didn’t try to convince Rene to go to church. Rodel just wanted to be Rene’s friend. So, Rene and Rodel went fishing together. After a while, Rene started going back to church on Sabbaths.
