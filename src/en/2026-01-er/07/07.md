“God knows everything we need. He gives us those things. The Lord has a storehouse filled with riches. He gives us all the supplies from His storehouse that we need. So, why don’t we trust Him more? God made precious promises to His children. If we obey God, He will keep those promises to us. God can remove every problem we have. He also can solve every problem. He can make the weak person strong. He can take away all our fears. He can help us do any good thing.

“So, we must not look at ourselves. The more we think about our mistakes, the more we will become weak. Then we will have less strength to solve our problems.”—Ellen G. White, That I May Know Him, page 224, adapted.

**Discussion Questions:**

`Think about times when God answered your prayers. What did these experiences teach you about God’s peace? What about prayers you are waiting for God to answer? How can you feel God’s promise of peace in your heart while you wait?`

`Read Philippians 4:8 about thinking good thoughts. What are some of the good things that you spend your time thinking about? How do these things make your faith strong? How do they make your relationship with the Lord strong, too?`

`Read the quote above from Ellen G. White again. Think about these sentences: “The more we think about our mistakes, the more we will become weak. Then we will have less strength to solve our problems.” What, then, is the secret to solving them?`
