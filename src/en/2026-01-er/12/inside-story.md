### “Nothing Happens Because of Chance”

A short time after Rene arrived in the Philippines, ADRA (Adventist Development and Relief Agency) offered him a job as an accountant. Rene worked with ADRA for one and a half years. Then he worked for eight years as an accountant for the Seventh-day Adventist church in the Philippines. Rene loved working for the church. Life was simple and happy. When he was a boy, Rene thought that becoming Seventh-day Adventist would make him rich. But now, Rene didn’t want to be rich. He just wanted to serve people until Jesus comes back.

Then Rene got a special job offer. The treasurer or money manager for the 1000 Missionary Movement was retiring. The 1000 Missionary Movement was part of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. This company trains hundreds of mis­sionaries or Bible workers every year at its headquarters in Silang, Philippines.

Rene wanted to be part of the 1000 Missionary Movement since he gave his heart to Jesus. Rene’s friend Rodel worked in the past as a Bible worker for the company. Rodel’s friendship helped Rene give his life back to Jesus. Now Rodel worked as a pastor in the Philippines. Rodel would be so happy if he knew that Rene was the new treasurer. But Rene wondered, “Can I do the job of treasurer? I’m only an accountant.”

That night, Rene dreamed he was working at the 1000 Missionary Movement. After the dream, a church leader told Rene to ask for the job. A short time later, a group of church leaders met together and gave Rene the job.

Rene is very happy with his decision to accept the job and trust in God. God continues to bless him. Family members who hated his religion are now joining the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Two months after he moved back to the Philippines, his parents got baptized. Rene said, “That was God’s gift to me. It was as if God said, ‘Because you were loyal to Me. I have a gift for you.’ ” Rene’s two sisters also were baptized.

In the meantime, the company where Rene worked in the Middle East went out of business during the COVID-19 pandemic. If Rene accepted more money and not the plane ticket home, he would have lost everything. Today, Rene says that he owes all his success to the Lord. “ ‘I know what I have planned for you,' says the Lord. 'I have good plans for you. I don’t plan to hurt you. I plan to give you hope and a good future’ ” (Jeremiah 29:11, ICB). Rene Tucaldo says, “Nothing happens because of chance. God had a plan for me.”

Rene Tucaldo is the accounting manager for the 1000 Missionary Movement, in Silang, Philippines. The headquarters were built with the help of a 13th Sabbath Offering, in 1996. Watch Rene’s story on YouTube at: bit.ly/Rene-1000MM.
