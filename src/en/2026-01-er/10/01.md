### Read for This Week’s Lesson

Colossians 2:1–7; Isaiah 61:3; 1 Corinthians 3:6; Colossians 2:11–23; Hebrews 1:3.

> <p>Memory Verse</p>
> “Some people may tell you that it is wrong for you to eat or to drink certain things. Or they make rules about special festival days, about new moons, or about the Jewish days for rest. Do not agree with people like [the same as] that. Rules like that are only like shadows of real things that would happen later. But now we have what is real, Christ [Jesus] himself!” (Colossians 2:16, 17, EASY).

Do people ask you why you keep the Sabbath? Maybe they used this week’s memory verse as “proof” against keeping it. But Colossians 2:16, 17 isn’t about the 4th com­mandment. The verse is really about false teachings in the church. What were those false teachings?

First, the false teachings are the ideas of men, not Bible truth (Colossians 2:8).

Also, the false teachings involve keeping Jewish holidays and circumcision. Circumcision is when the tip of the male sex parts is cut off to show that a man belonged to God. The false teachings also included Jewish rules about being clean and food rules (Colossians 2:16, 21).

The false teachers were religious people. They cared about Bible truth. But they didn’t understand the Good News about Jesus. This week, we’ll understand why. We also will learn why the memory verse is not talking about keeping the 7th day Sabbath.
