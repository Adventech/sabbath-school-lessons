### Prison or Death

After Rene went to church on Sabbath for six months, his boss told him to come to his office. The boss said, “The other accountant doesn’t have your skills or know-how. Can I ask you a favor? Can you work for at least one hour on Saturday?”

Rene remembered his prayer for the past two years. He prayed, “God, if You help me go to church on Saturday, I will keep the Sabbath holy until I die.”

Rene shook his head no. “I cannot.”

His boss said, “You must. Only for one hour. What time is your church?”

Rene answered, “8:00 a.m. to noon.”

His boss nodded. “Then come in the afternoon. You can come at 1 o’clock.”

Rene said, “But it’s Saturday.”

His boss said, “It’s OK.”

Rene said, “It’s not OK with me.”

Rene’s boss looked at him long and hard. His boss said, “The choice is yours.” Then he left his office.

Six weeks later, the boss talked to Rene again. He asked, “What is your final decision? You must work this coming Saturday. If you don’t, I don’t know what I will do.”

Rene knew he worked in a country that wasn’t nice to Christians. Christians didn’t have permission to live their faith. Rene heard about people getting punished for their faith. Some people were thrown in jail, and other people were killed.

Back home, Rene prayed. “Lord, I have a lot of problems. Do you want me to die here?”

Three days later, Rene went to church on Sabbath. He lived in an apartment that was in the same building where he worked. As Rene left the building, a fellow worker asked, “Will you be coming into the office today?”

Rene said, “I will not come.”

Rene had a company cellphone. He turned the phone off. He didn’t want the phone to track or follow him when he went to church.

Rene’s boss did come into the office during the daytime on Saturday. The boss usually came into the office only on Saturday nights. But that afternoon, the boss made a surprise visit to the office. He called Rene many times that Sabbath. But Rene didn’t answer because he turned off his phone.

Later, the coworker told Rene, “The boss behaved the same as the devil. His eyes were very red. He looked as if he wanted to eat you alive! He may want to send you to prison. Please don’t get us into trouble, too.”
