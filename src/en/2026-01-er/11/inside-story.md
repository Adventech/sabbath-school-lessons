### Forced to Choose

Rene chose to go to church and not to the office on the Sabbath. After sundown, he came back to the building where he lived and worked. A fellow worker handed Rene a letter from the boss. The letter said that the boss fired him.

Rene was surprised. He didn’t know what would happen next. Rene was a foreigner working in a country that didn’t allow people to worship Jesus. Rene wondered if he would be sent to prison. Would he stay strong if he must die for his faith? Rene prayed, “Lord, do You want me to go home to the Philippines? If You want me to die here, that’s fine with me. Many people know I’m fighting for my faith.”

Early the next morning, he went to the office and emailed his boss. He wrote, “I respect you. You are my friend and big brother. I know we need to talk when you come into the office.”

That night, his boss came to work. He was upset. Rene prayed, “Lord, please help. Help my boss not to feel angry. But if it’s Your will that I die, I accept.”

Then the boss told Rene to come to his office. Rene tried to stand up. But he couldn’t. His knees wouldn’t support him. Rene felt as if he were dying. With all his strength, he lifted himself out of his chair and walked to his boss’ office. Just before he knocked on the door, he heard a voice inside his heart. The voice said, “Don’t be afraid. I am the true God. I keep My promises.”

Rene opened the door. His boss looked angry. As Rene walked in, the voice whispered again, “I am the true God. I keep my promises.” The voice said these words in Rene’s heart again.

The boss held out two pieces of paper to Rene. The boss said, “Choose one.” When Rene looked confused, the boss said, “One paper is a work contract. The other is a plane ­ticket.”

Rene felt thankful that he wasn’t going to be arrested. He prayed a silent pray in his heart: “Thank You, Lord, I’m not going to prison.” Rene chose the plane ticket.

But the boss said, “Read the contract first.”

Rene saw that he would get double pay if he worked for only one hour on Saturdays. Rene chose the ticket again. Rene wondered how he would pay for the ticket. He heard the voice say in his heart again, “I am the true God. I keep my promises.”

Rene went home to the Philippines. On the plane, he prayed, “You say, ‘I am the true God. I keep My promises.’ What is Your promise to me?”

The voice whispered, “You won’t use up all your money before you get a new job.”
