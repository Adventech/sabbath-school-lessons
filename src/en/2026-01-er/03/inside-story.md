### Peacocks Save the Day!

Many cobras lived outside the Sunshine Children’s Home and School in Bangalore, India. Cobras are snakes that have long teeth filled with poison. A cobra’s bite can hurt and even kill. So Beulah Fernandez had good reason to be worried. Beulah was the manager of the Seventh-day Adventist home and school. Five years ago, a cobra bit a boy as the boy chased a baby cow across a mango grove. Mangoes are tropical fruit. The boy was rushed to the hospital. The doctors operated on him many times. The boy needed to take medicine for a whole year before he got well.

Now the baby cobras were everywhere on the 10-acres of land that belonged to the school. Baby cobras were in the garden, under the car, and even outside the door of Beulah’s house.

Beulah prayed, “O Lord! Let this school and home be a safe place for children. Please help!”

Beulah paid snake-catchers to come remove the snakes. But the snake-catchers were used to catching snakes in city buildings and closed spaces. The snake-catchers had trouble finding the baby cobras on the big property that was filled with tropical fruit trees.

Teachers and students prayed with all their hearts.

Then a teacher saw a peacock arrive in the schoolyard. Could that really be a peacock? A peacock in the schoolyard in the middle of a big city? Peacocks liked to eat cobras and other snakes with long teeth filled with poison.

A short time later, another teacher saw a second peacock.

A few evenings later, the male peacock and his wife, a peahen, put on a royal show for the teachers and children. The shiny blue peacock opened all his beautiful long tail feathers, the same as a giant fan. The tip of each feather was marked with what looked the same as a big eye. The peacock shook his feathers as he walked around the yard. He was very pleased with himself.

After that the baby cobras disappeared.

The peacock and his wife continued to stay at the school to guard the teachers and children from snakes. To this day, someone will see one of the birds and shout, “Peacock!” And the children run to look at the bird because it was so beautiful and fancy.

In the 45-year history of the school and home, no peacocks visited the campus before. Beulah says, “We believe God sent the peacocks.

God really loves and cares for His children. He can amaze us with beautiful answers that solve all our troubles.”
