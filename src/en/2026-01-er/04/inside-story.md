### Money That Never Runs Out

11-year-old Alvan Harold liked feeling coins in his pocket while he walked home from school. Alvan lived in Kisumu, Kenya. With the coins, Alvan could stop at a sweet shop on the way home. Then he could buy some nuts or ice cream.

A fifth-grade Bible teacher surprised Alvan when she ­scolded him for spending all his money on sweets. She said, “You shouldn’t spend all your money on nuts and ice cream. Save some to give to God on Sabbath.”

So, Alvan put money in the offering plate on Sabbath. Alvan’s father gave him the money that Sabbath morning. Teacher t­alked about that money, too.

Teacher said, “When you give money from your parents, you are giving for your parents. You aren’t giving your own money.” She read Malachi 3:8: “ ‘People should not steal things from God, but you stole things from me. You say, “What did we steal from you?” You should have given me one-tenth of your things. You should have given me special gifts’ ” (ERV).

Alvan thought that Teacher was accusing him of stealing from God. Alvan didn’t like that. But then he thought, “Maybe Teacher is just a little bit right.”

When Thursday came, Alvan already spent all his pocket money for the week. He decided to save money for God the next week. But the next week, he again spent all his money. Two months passed. Alvan was disappointed with himself. He just didn’t know how to save his money for the offering.

A short time later, Alvan and his 17-year-old brother, Allan, passed an ice cream shop on their way home. Alvan had a 20-shilling coin (20 US cents) in his pocket. Alvan decided to spend his money on ice cream. But his big brother stopped him. He said, “Alvan, walking around eating ice cream is silly and childish.” Alvan was upset. He wanted ice cream, but he obeyed his big brother. So, Alvan didn’t buy anything.

When Sabbath came, Alvan had the 20 shillings in his ­pocket. Alvan put the coin in the offering plate, along with the 20 shillings his parents gave him that morning. Alvan felt happy to give his own money. He gave up something he ­really wanted so that he could give God an offering. Alvan now understood that he didn’t lose anything when he gave up the ice cream.

The next week, Alvan saved another 20 shillings. He gave it as an offering. Alvan liked this feeling of giving! To this day, Alvan keeps giving his offering every Sabbath. He never runs out of money. Sometimes Alvan wants to buy nuts or ice cream. But he tells himself that he must have 20 shillings for God on Sabbath.

Alvan said, “I tell myself that supporting God’s work is better than anything I could buy.”
