### Read for This Week’s Lesson

Philippians 2:1–8; Jeremiah 17:9; Romans 8:3, Hebrews 2:14–18.

> <p>Memory Verse</p>
> “Then do what will make my joy complete: Agree with each other, and show your love for each other. Be united in your goals [plans] and in the way you think” (Philippians 2:2, ERV).

When we are united, we are strong. As a church, we know we need to be united. But knowing is not the same thing as doing. We may try very hard to be united. Sometimes we succeed. Other times we may fail. Paul tells the Philippians that their being united is very important. That’s why Paul says, “Think about things in the same way as one another [each other]. Love one another completely. In your spirit, agree with one another. And work together for the same purpose [plan]” Philippians 2:2, EASY).

Paul’s teaching about working together for peace comes from Jesus. We read about this topic everywhere in the New Testament. When did we stop working together? The problem started in the heart of an angel in heaven. That angel was Lucifer (Isaiah 14:12–14). Other angels joined Lucifer in his fight against God’s law and government. Then in Eden, Adam and Eve joined Lucifer’s fight against God’s law (Genesis 3:1–6).

This week, we will look at what the Bible teaches about why we must work together for peace in the church. We also will look at the lessons we can learn from Jesus about this topic.
