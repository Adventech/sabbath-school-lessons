`Read Joshua 4:20–24 in the light of the following verses: Judg. 3:7; Judg. 8:34; Ps. 78:11; Deut. 8:2, 18; Ps. 45:17. Why was it so important to remember the mighty deeds of the Lord?`

Notice the change in person in Joshua 4:23. The waters of the Jordan are referred to as having been dried up before “you,” that is, before all the Israelites who have just crossed the Jordan. In contrast, the Red Sea is said to had been dried up before “us,” those who were still present from the first generation and who experienced the Exodus. The two events experienced by two different generations were similar in significance, which enabled the second generation, through the testimony of their parents, to rediscover the same meaning of the Jordan crossing for themselves.

Generally, we perceive forgetfulness as a normal trait of all human beings. However, forgetfulness in the spiritual sense can lead to serious consequences.

Even today, if we want to maintain our identity as a people with a peculiar calling and mission, we will have to create occasions for refreshing both our individual and corporate spiritual memory in order to keep in focus where we are coming from, who we are, and what we are here for.

`Read 1 Corinthians 11:24, 25 and John 14:26. Why must we always remember what Christ did for us? What else really matters without it?`

Ellen G. White clearly understood that without constantly guiding ourselves in the light of God’s past acts and revelation, we will surely lose the motivation to carry out our mission in the future: “We have nothing to fear for the future, except as we shall forget the way the Lord has led us, and His teaching in our past history.”—Ellen G. White, Life Sketches, p. 196.

`Though it is important to remember the past and how the Lord has worked in your life, why must you day by day have an experience with Him and the reality of His love and presence now?`
