“He turned the sea into dry land;

They went through the river on foot.

There we will rejoice in Him” (Ps. 66:6, NKJV).

Both the crossing of the Red Sea and of the Jordan are markers of a new era in biblical history, and both carry symbolic significance (see Ps. 66:6, Ps. 114:1–7, and 2 Kings 2:6–15). Already in the Old Testament, there are texts that link the two crossing events and recognize a meaning, which points beyond the original settings. In Psalm 66, the psalmist celebrated God’s redemptive act in his life (Ps. 66:16–19) by referring to the historical examples of the crossing of the Red Sea and of the Jordan.

Psalm 114 also ties the two events together, not because the author did not see a chronological difference between them but because of the theological significance that the two crossings share. Thus, both events are seen as contributing to a change in Israel’s status, once from slavery to freedom, then from nomadic landlessness to nationhood. In these psalms, the examples of the two crossings illustrate the change in status of the author from oppression, poverty, helplessness, and humiliation to safety, well-being, salvation, and dignity.

It is also by the Jordan that Elijah’s translation takes place in the context of a similar miracle to the one recorded in Joshua. For Elijah, the crossing brought the most significant status change in his life: he was taken to heaven. For Elisha, the change is also important: the prophet’s assistant (1 Kings 19:21) becomes the prophet of the nation (2 Kings 2:22).

`Read Matthew 3:16, 17 and Mark 1:9. How do these writers of the New Testament imply a symbolic, spiritual meaning of the Jordan River?`

The earthly ministry of Jesus, as the Representative of Israel, follows the pattern of the history of ancient Israel. Jesus undergoes the “Red Sea” and “Jordan” experiences. He is called out of Egypt after a death decree (Matt. 2:14–16); spends 40 days in the wilderness (Matt. 4:2), similar to ancient Israel’s 40 years; and, as a transition from His private life to His public ministry, He is baptized in the Jordan (Matt. 3:16, 17; Mark 1:9).

Later, Hebrews 3–4 recognizes the symbolic significance of the crossing of the Jordan and presents the entrance into Canaan as foreshadowing the “rest of grace” that Christians enter through faith.
