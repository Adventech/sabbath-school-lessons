`Read Joshua 4. Why did God ask the Israelites to build a memorial?`

The purpose of these stones is to become a “sign.” The Hebrew term 'ot is often associated with the word “wonder” and can refer to miraculous acts done by God (see yesterday’s study), such as the plagues on Egypt (Exod. 7:3, Deut. 4:34). It also can carry the meaning of “symbol” or “token,” as an outward sign of a deeper or transcendent reality. For example, the rainbow is a “sign” of the covenant (Gen. 9:12, 13); the blood on the doorposts and lintels of the Israelite houses also is called a “sign” (Exod. 12:13); and most significantly, the Sabbath is a “sign” of Creation and of God’s sanctifying presence (Exod. 31:13, 17; Ezek. 20:12).

Here, the sign functions as a memorial, reminding each subsequent generation of the miracle of the crossing. The term “memorial” (zikkaron) comes from the word zakar, “to remember,” which denotes more than a passive act of recalling something. It implies a remembering followed by a proper action (Deut. 5:15, Deut. 8:2). The setting up of stone memorials (Gen. 28:18–22) and rituals that triggered questions (Exod. 12:26, 27; Deut. 6:20–25) was common in the Old Testament. Instead of repeating the miracles again and again, God establishes monuments that evoke the memory of His great acts and prompt meaningful answers. Therefore, the sign is to be there “forever,” implying the need to keep this miracle of the Lord in the collective memory of His people perpetually.

The potential question of future generations is significant because it is formulated in a personal way: “What are these stones to you?” Each new generation must internalize and understand the meaning of these stones for themselves personally. The faith in a miracle-making God can be kept alive only if each generation rediscovers the significance of the mighty acts of Yahweh for themselves. Such a faith will make a major difference between living out faithfully Bible-based traditions and traditionalism, the dead religion, deprived of its original value and fervor, of the living generation. In the end, we need to make our Bible-based faith our own. No one, especially our ancestors, can believe for us.

`What are some of the memorials, personal memorials, from your own walk with the Lord that help you remember what He has done for you?`
