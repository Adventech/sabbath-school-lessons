### Read for This Week’s Study
Joshua 3, Num. 14:44, Luke 18:18–27, Joshua 4, John 14:26, Heb. 4:8–11.

> <p>Memory Text:</p>
> “ ‘For the Lord your God dried up the waters of the Jordan for you until you passed over, as the Lord your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up for us until we passed over, so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of the Lord is mighty, that you may fear the Lord your God forever’ ” (Joshua 4:23, 24, ESV).

The police officer signaled. John had to pull over. The officer asked for his driver’s license, and, at that moment, it dawned on John that he had left his wallet, with his driver’s license, in the office. John explained what happened, and the officer asked about his job. John responded that he was a professor. As the officer gave John a ticket, he told him not to think of it as a fine.

“It’s tuition,” he said. “When people want to learn something, they pay tuition. This is your tuition to learn not to forget your license when driving. Have a good day, professor!”

As human beings, we are prone to forget things that are not constantly in our sight. We forget to return phone calls, respond to emails, water the plants, send birthday wishes, and so forth. The list could go on. Forgetting about our spiritual needs, however, could have more severe consequences than simply receiving a fine, especially because we are dealing with what is, literally, our eternal destiny.

Let’s study the crossing of the Jordan by the Hebrews and see what we can learn from their experiences.
