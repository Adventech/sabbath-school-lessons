As we have learned, God had given the pagan nations an opportunity to know about Him and to turn from their evil ways (see Lesson 5). They, however, had refused and were ultimately facing the judgment of God.

`Read Joshua 7:6–9, which deals with Joshua’s initial reaction to the calamity that befell them. Focus especially on Joshua 7:9. What important theological principle is found in his words?`

At first, Joshua sounds like the children of Israel in the midst of their hardships after leaving Egypt: “ ‘Oh, that we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the pots of meat and when we ate bread to the full! For you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger’ ” (Exod. 16:3, NKJV).

And here’s Joshua: “ ‘Alas, Lord God, why have You brought this people over the Jordan at all—to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? Oh, that we had been content, and dwelt on the other side of the Jordan!’ ” (Josh. 7:7, NKJV).

Soon after, however, he shows his great concern for the damage that the name and reputation of God will take from this defeat. “ ‘For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear it, and surround us, and cut off our name from the earth. Then what will You do for Your great name?’ ” (Josh. 7:9, NKJV).

This reveals a theme and principle that was central to God’s purposes with Israel. Though He wanted the pagan nations around them to see what great things God would do for His people who obeyed Him, they could also, as Rahab did, learn about Israel’s God by the power of His people’s conquests. On the other hand, were things to go badly, as they did here, the nations would deem Israel’s God weak and ineffective (see Num. 14:16, Deut. 9:28), which could embolden Canaanite resistance.

In other words, even in the context of the Hebrews’ taking the land, great issues and principles were involved, which included bringing honor and glory to God, who was also the only hope for the pagans, as well as for Israel.

`Read Deuteronomy 4:5–9. In what ways can we see a parallel here between Israel and their witness to the world and our witness as Seventh-day Adventists today?`
