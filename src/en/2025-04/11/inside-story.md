#### Mission: God’s Helping Hand

__

Kim Sun was excited to be sent to a remote area of the Philippines to serve as a missionary for 10 months with the 1000 Missionary Movement. But he wondered how he would spend those 10 months. He remembered that he had argued with his parents about the Bible for five years and gotten nowhere. Now he only had 10 months.

As he prayed, he thought, “If I bring the Bible first, maybe people will reject it like my parents. Maybe I first need to show them the character of Jesus.”

Sun decided not to tell anyone that he was a missionary. He wouldn’t tell anyone about biblical doctrines. He would just make friends for three months.

Upon arriving at the rural town where he would live, Sun visited each of its 20 to 30 houses to offer to help his new neighbors.

“Do you need help with anything? ” he asked the woman at the first house. “I want to serve you. Please let me know how I may be of help.”

She happily accepted Sun’s kind offer.

News of the helpful new neighbor spread from house to house in the neighborhood. Soon a line of people came by who needed or wanted help. The first woman whose house he visited kindly fed him lunch and supper as he helped 17 people in the neighborhood that first day.

As Sun walked home, he felt tired. But he thought, “I’m a missionary!”

Sun soon had a long list of names of people to visit who wanted his help. From Monday to Friday, he visited two homes in the morning and two in the afternoon.

He also found other ways to be a friend to the townspeople. He grew corn and gave it away. When people asked how much they owed, he replied, “Nothing! The corn came from God. God has paid for you.” Once, he saw a boy with a sore on his leg, and he treated the sore with ointment. When the sore healed completely a few days later, the parents came to him and asked, “How can we ever thank you?”

Sun served the townspeople without identifying himself as a missionary for three months. It wasn’t a secret; nobody asked him. He prayed about the next three months.
