This week we are going to look at some key moments during Israel’s presence in the Promised Land, when the people rededicated themselves to the Lord, sometimes in the face of impending danger. Joshua made the seemingly irrational decision to circumcise the Israelites on enemy territory (Josh. 5:1–9); to celebrate the Passover in the face of imminent danger (Josh. 5:10–12); to build an altar and worship the Lord while the conquest was in full swing (Josh. 8:30–35); and to set up the tabernacle of the Lord when seven tribes in Israel had not yet received their inheritance (Josh. 18:1, 2).

In our busy lives, we tend to give attention to the urgencies that life throws at us. Very often we neglect to carve out quality time to renew our commitment to God and to pause and express our thankfulness for what He has done and daily continues to do for us. Morning and evening worship, as well as the family altar, seem to be so out of context in our overcharged, convenience-driven, and achievement-oriented life. Yet, deep in our hearts, we all know that the occasions spent together with God and our loved ones are the best investment of our limited time.
