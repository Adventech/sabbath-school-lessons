`Read Genesis 18:25; Psalm 7:11; Psalm 50:6; Psalm 82:1; Psalm 96:10; and 2 Timothy 4:1, 8. What are these verses saying about God’s moral character? How does the role of God as the Judge of the universe help us understand the question of divine war?`

The holiness of God’s character means that He cannot tolerate sin. He is patient. However, sin must reap its final consequence, which is death (Rom. 6:23). Yahweh declared war against sin, regardless of where it was found, whether in Israel or among the Canaanites. Israel was not sanctified through participating in holy wars any more than other nations were (Deut. 9:4, 5; Deut. 12:29, 30), even when they became the means of Yahweh’s judgment against His chosen nation. Different from other ancient Near Eastern people, the Israelites experienced the reversal of holy war when God did not fight for them but against them, allowing their enemies to oppress them (compare with Joshua 7).

The whole concept of holy war can be understood only if it is seen in the light of God’s activity as judge. When seen this way, Israel’s wars of conquest take on a completely different character. In contrast to the imperialistic wars of self-aggrandizement, so common in the ancient world (and ours today), Israel’s wars were not meant to accomplish glory for themselves but to establish God’s justice and peace in the land. Therefore, at the heart of understanding the concept of holy war stands the concept of God’s rule and sovereignty, which are at stake in the imagery of God as warrior, just as they are in the imagery of God as king or as judge.

Yahweh as warrior is the One who, as a judge, is committed to implementing, stabilizing, and maintaining the rule of the law, which is the reflection of His character. The image of God as warrior, similar to that of judge and king, asserts that Yahweh will not tolerate rebellion against His established order forever. Therefore, one can affirm that the goal of Yahweh’s activity is never war itself, or victory itself, but the reestablishment of justice and peace. Ultimately, to judge and to wage war, or to deliver justice, are the same thing if God is the subject of the action.

`Reflect on God as a righteous judge who cannot be bribed nor influenced by partiality. How is a God who will not endlessly tolerate sin, oppression, the suffering of the innocent, and the exploitation of the oppressed part and parcel of the gospel?`
