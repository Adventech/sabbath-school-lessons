`Joshua, as a type, points beyond the ministry of Jesus Christ to a fulfillment in the life of the church, Christ’s body. In what sense do the wars Israel fought under Joshua foreshadow the spiritual struggles of the church? How are they different? See 1 Tim. 1:18, 2 Tim. 4:7, Eph. 6:10–12, 2 Cor. 10:3–5, and Acts 20:32.`

The writers of the New Testament recognize the ecclesiological (church) fulfillment of the Joshua typology. The members of Christ’s body, the church, are involved in a spiritual warfare against evil forces; nevertheless, they enjoy the rest of God’s grace (Heb. 4:9–11) and the blessings of their spiritual inheritance.

`What do these texts say about the ultimate fulfillment of the Joshua typology? 1 Pet. 1:4, Col. 3:24, Rev. 20:9, Rev. 21:3.`

The final and complete fulfillment of the Joshua typology will be accomplished at the second coming of Jesus Christ (apocalyptic/eschatological aspect).

Joshua’s life reflected so much of God’s character that certain aspects of his life took on a prophetic character foreshadowing the activity and person of the Messiah.

For us, today, the Messiah has already come. His ministry does not need to be prefigured, but we still have the privilege of reflecting His character—the glory that Christ longed to share with His disciples (John 17:22) and that can become ours by contemplating the character of Christ (2 Cor. 3:18). The more we contemplate Jesus, the more we reflect the beauty of His character. This is so foundational to what our daily walk with Christ should lead to. This is why time in the Word, every day, is so important. This is why, too, we should also spend time dwelling on the life and character and teachings of Jesus. By beholding, yes, we do become changed.

`Joshua, the type, asked the Israelites: “ ‘How long will you neglect to go and possess the land which the Lord God of your fathers has given you?’ ” (Josh. 18:3, NKJV). How would Jesus, the antitype of Joshua, phrase that question today?`
