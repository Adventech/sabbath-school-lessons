**Scripture Song:** Be strong and of good courage – Deut. 31:6

	- Who is thankful that the LORD doesn’t abandon us when we stumble and fall?

	- Joshua 9:3-13 What are your thoughts about the deceptive conduct of the Gibeonites? What alternative course of action might they have taken?

	- How did the LORD show mercy and grace to the Gibeonites despite their deceptive conduct? Joshua 9:22-27
	- Why is it important to remember that while there is forgiveness if we confess our sins (1 John 1:9), there may still be negative consequences when we sin?

	- Share a time when you became deeply aware of God’s mercy and grace.
