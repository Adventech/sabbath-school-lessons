`Read Numbers 13:6, 30–32 and Joshua 14:6, 14. Who was Caleb? What was his place among the people of Israel?`

The name of Caleb comes from the Hebrew word keleb, “dog,” which occurs in the Old Testament, always in a negative context. However, keleb is used in extra-biblical letters and hymns to express a servant’s courage, tenacity, and faithfulness to his or her master. In this respect, Caleb was faithful to his name, demonstrating throughout his life unwavering loyalty to his Lord.

`What does it say about Caleb that he was willing to speak his mind even though the majority of the spies had a completely different opinion, and the people of Israel threatened him with death? See Num. 14:6–10, 21–25; Num. 26:65; Num. 32:12.`

Consider these important Israelite leaders, contemporaries of Joshua and Caleb: Shammua, Shaphat, Igal, Palti, Gaddiel, Gaddi, Ammiel, Sethur, Nahbi, and Geuel. Do these names sound familiar?

Probably not.

Why? Because they are the names of the other ten spies sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan. They are forgotten because their names were not worthy of being remembered. The report that they brought portrayed the Promised Land as impossible to conquer. They saw themselves as grasshoppers compared to the giants who inhabited some areas of the land, and their hearts melted with fear at the “impregnable” walls of the fortified cities in Canaan.

Caleb, as the older of the two spies who brought a positive report, takes the lead in presenting another possibility: the attitude of faith. He was willing to speak up for what he knew was right, despite the opposition, even in the face of potential death: “And all the congregation said to stone them with stones” (Num. 14:10, NKJV).

`What do you do when most people around you seem to have a different opinion, one that goes contrary to your deepest convictions?`
