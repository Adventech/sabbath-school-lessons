The long lists of place names, which constituted landmarks on the borders of the territories assigned to the tribes of Israel, are bookended by the report of land allocation to the two heroes, Caleb and Joshua, of the first reconnoiter. Caleb received his inheritance first, while Joshua received his last. Up to this point, Joshua allocated the land to the tribes of Israel; now it is time for the people of Israel to give Joshua his inheritance.

`Read Joshua 19:49–51. What are the implications of the fact that the great leader of Israel who apportioned the land receives his inheritance last?`

The city that Joshua receives is Timnath-serah, a name composed of two words. The first, Timnath, derives from a verb (manah) whose meaning is to count or to assign, and it means portion or territory. The second word can be derived from a Hebrew verb (seracḥ), and it means excess or leftover (compare with Exod. 26:12). The name of Joshua’s city can be translated as the leftover portion or the remaining territory.

The name of the city that Joshua has chosen from what was left testifies to the noble character of Israel’s second leader. First of all, he waited until all the people received their portion. Then, Joshua did not choose one of the densely populated territories of the land or the most impressive cities as his inheritance but a modest city, or perhaps the ruins of it, in order to rebuild it with arduous work (compare with Josh. 19:50).

Moreover, Timnath-serah was located near Shiloh, in the vicinity of the sanctuary, which shows where Joshua’s priorities lay and where his heart was bound. Certainly, after the newly born nation of Israel had been led into the Promised Land, and, with God’s help, secured the inheritance of each tribe and family, it would not have objected to Joshua’s demand for a more impressive inheritance. Yet, Joshua was content to live a simple life with a focus on what is most important, thus embodying the prayer expressed later by David: “One thing I have desired of the Lord, that will I seek: That I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in His temple” (Ps. 27:4, NKJV).

`What lessons can you draw for yourself regarding Joshua’s attitude? How might you apply it to yourself now?`
