`Read Joshua 15:16–19, Judges 1:13, and Judges 3:7–11. What does this story tell you about the power of example? How is Caleb’s attitude being reproduced in the younger generation?`

In this passage, Caleb offers his daughter, Achsah, in marriage to the one who conquers Debir. Othniel captures the city and wins the hand of Achsah. This story is important because, once again, it reveals Caleb’s courage, faith, and readiness to take on challenges.

It also shows that the next generation of Israelites followed the example of these giants of faith, Caleb and Joshua. As the older generation closes their ministry, there is a new generation ready to face the challenges and continue to fulfill God’s plan for Israel.

In a way that is not unlike Caleb’s request to Joshua, “Give me this hill country,” Achsah, encouraged by her husband, displays the same faith and resolution that her father demonstrated. Through her determination and boldness, Achsah continues the line of Caleb’s example of the fulfillment of the promise to possess the land.

Indeed, the land is a gift from Yahweh to Israel, but Israel must appropriate it by claiming the promises of the Lord with faith and courage. Achsah’s determination foreshadows the perseverance of those women in the Gospels who would not be turned away by the crowd or the disciples and would not give up until they received Jesus’ blessing for themselves and their families.

`Read Luke 18:1–5. What lesson is here for us?`

`Passing on the torch of faith to the next generation is crucial to the fulfillment of the mission God has entrusted to us. Think about the challenges of passing on faith to the next generation, on the one hand, and about the opportunities for young people to assume more responsibility in the work of God, on the other. What can we do to facilitate and train youth to assume godly leadership? How crucial is our example in this process?`
