`Read Joshua 1:7–9 together with Genesis 24:40, Isaiah 53:10, and Psalm 1:1–3. Based on these texts, what does it mean to be prosperous and successful?`

The Hebrew term tsalakh, “prosperous” (Josh. 1:8), implies the satisfactory accomplishment of what was planned, or a state of favorable circumstances.

The term sakal, “to be wise” (Josh. 1:8), can be translated as “prosper” or “be successful.” But it also can mean “to be prudent,” or “to act wisely.” It occurs frequently in Job, Proverbs, and Psalms, where the notion of success is closely tied to acting wisely by fearing God and obeying His Word.

According to this insight, success is not necessarily defined as material prosperity, though it does not exclude it. Success has to be seen as a state of harmony with the spiritual values and principles that lie at the foundation of God’s created world and that are expressed in His law.

Indeed, trust in God’s promises, especially the promise of salvation by faith alone and obedience to His law, are not opposed to each other. They represent two sides of the same coin.

`Read Romans 3:31. What does this text say about the relationship between law and faith?`

To pit faith in the atoning and sacrificial death of Jesus in our behalf against obedience to God’s law is to set up a false and dangerous dichotomy. Law and grace always go together. Only a superficial understanding of the role of the law can lead to perceiving “law” and “grace” as opposites.

The writers of the Old Testament had a high regard for the law and considered it a source of delight (Ps. 1:2; Ps. 119:70, 77, 174). Rightly regarded and used, the law will lead to a deeper understanding of one’s own sinfulness (Rom. 7:7) and the need for Christ’s righteousness (Gal. 3:24).

`However much by God’s grace you seek to keep His law, how has your own experience shown you your need for Christ’s covering righteousness?`
