Part I: Overview

Key Text: Joshua 21:45

Study Focus: Josh. 21:43–45; 2 Tim. 2:11–13; Joshua 23; Rev. 14:10, 19; Deut. 6:5.

The Bible relates history with a specific purpose. The authors are not neutral observers; they always aim to convey a theological message. They depict the inspired version of what happened but are also interested in the meaning of history. Divine inspiration gave biblical historians the right glasses to see history. The prophetic meaning of the book of Joshua is more evident in the Hebrew tradition, which includes the book in the section called “Nevi’im” (The Prophets). The history between Joshua and 2 Kings is known as the “Former Prophets,” and it is part of the historical background that sets the stage for understanding the major and minor prophets, which are known as the “Latter Prophets” in the Hebrew canon.

Joshua’s final speeches in the book present its theological core. The main message can be summarized in three words: “God is faithful.” Because He also is powerful, not one of His promises can fail. The book presents the biblical perspective that history progresses in line with God’s sovereign purpose, regardless of Israel’s response. However, it points out that for Israel to receive and maintain God’s blessings, they must also be faithful. Regrettably, subsequent generations did not heed this admonition, as shown in the canonical flow of Scripture. In this context, Joshua and Judges represent two sides of the same coin: the first is God’s unwavering faithfulness, and the second is Israel’s persistent unfaithfulness.

#### Part II: Commentary

Part II: Commentary

God’s faithfulness became apparent in the relationship with His children within the covenant context. The biblical account portrayed God’s unwavering devotion to His covenant, despite the backsliding attitude of human beings. God’s fidelity was an attribute of His character (Deut. 32:4, Isa. 49:7), which was rooted in His “loyal love” (ḥesed) (Deut. 7:9, LEB). In fact, God’s loyal love and faithfulness are often mentioned together (Mic. 7:20, LEB). The divine commitment to uphold His promises despite shameful human failures is a concrete manifestation of God’s loyal love (ḥesed), evident in every covenant throughout the Bible, from the Adamic to the Davidic covenants.

Adamic Covenant

The fundamental promise of the Adamic covenant involved numerous offspring and dominion over the earth (Gen. 1:28). Human beings, as bearers of the image of God, were meant to thrive as co-rulers of God by reproducing life and governing over creation. However, this divine blessing is disrupted by human disobedience. Despite this disruption, God’s plans were not thwarted. In the new reality, childbirth became painful (Gen. 3:16), and human interaction with the earth was directly impacted (Gen. 3:17–19). Nevertheless, despite human failure, God remained committed to His plan and promised that the seed of the woman would destroy the serpent and restore the lost dominion (Gen. 3:15). The tragic chapter of Genesis 3 closed with Adam’s naming Eve (in Hebrew, “life”), who would become the mother of all life (Gen. 3:20), clearly indicating that death would not have the final word.

**Noahic Covenant**

Noahic Covenant

By Genesis 6, sin had led humanity almost to the point of no return. In the moral realm, there was a process of de-creation, reverting the good creation to a state of only evil all the time (Gen. 6:5). So, it comes as no surprise that de-creation takes place in the natural world, as well, bringing the earth to the initial state of watery silence. The silence was broken only by Noah and his family on the ark. After the Flood, God renewed the Adamic covenant with Noah, using the same phraseology found in Genesis 1:28 (compare with Gen. 9:1). As a new Adam, Noah was blessed with the promise of many descendants and dominion. However, Noah also failed. Echoing the Fall, Noah took the fruit of the vine, drank, and exposed himself, becoming naked, as Adam and Eve had before him. As a result of his action, a curse, which defined the future of his offspring, was pronounced. But still, God remained committed to His plan.

Abrahamic Covenant

The primeval history concluded with Genesis 11, where humanity once again rebelled against God. In an attempt to frustrate God’s original plan to scatter humanity and to establish a dominion independent from Him (by making “a name for ourselves” [Gen. 11:4, NKJV]), humans constructed the Tower of Babel, which became a monument to confusion. Casting doubt on God’s faithfulness to His promises, they epitomized legalism by seeking to save themselves without Him. From a canonical perspective, the appearance of Abraham at this point was not coincidental. Abraham’s call showed that not everything was lost. There was still faithfulness on this earth. The same elements of original blessing were found in the Abrahamic covenant: numerous descendants and dominion (Gen. 12:1–3). This covenant marked a fresh start for creation. Indeed, the parallels between the Abrahamic and Noahic covenants were remarkable and indicated that they were different phases of the same covenant. However, like Adam, Abraham failed by heeding Sarah’s advice to take Hagar as a wife. The parallels between Adam’s fall and Abraham’s actions are evident, as shown in the table below.

Undoubtedly, Abraham was obedient, but his obedience was too precarious. His offspring followed his faithful example but were also below the mark. In fact, the loyal lineage became a mess between Isaac and Jacob. Still, God could use them to be a blessing to the nations (see Joseph’s story in which life was preserved and the Abrahamic seed held dominion), but they ended up stuck in Egypt, later to become enslaved. Nevertheless, God remained committed to His plan.

**Mosaic Covenant**

Mosaic Covenant

Even when God’s people were slaves in Egypt, His plan for them was progressing. The echoes of Genesis 1:28 were evident in Exodus 1:7: “But the children of Israel were fruitful and increased abundantly, multiplied and grew exceedingly mighty; and the land was filled with them” (NKJV). There was only one element missing: dominion. And that was where Pharaoh’s concerns started. He devised a plan to decrease Israel’s number to prevent them from becoming stronger than the Egyptians, who, in turn, would be dominated by them. In this context, Pharaoh was thus intervening in God’s original plan, and for this reason he and his kingdom were judged.

God brought His people out of Egypt in order to renew the covenant with them on Mount Sinai. And again, humanity fell short of the divine expectation. Moses was still on the top of the mountain when the people started to worship the golden calf, attributing to it their deliverance from slavery (Exod. 32:4). Just a few weeks later, the Israelites were once again in rebellion, refusing to enter Canaan because of their unbelief (Num. 14:11). But God was still committed to His plan. It is true that in each covenant new human players appeared, and God adapted to the new circumstances. But His faithfulness remained unaltered.

**Davidic Covenant**

Davidic Covenant

The initial conquest under the leadership of Joshua was a success, but it still needed to be completed. In addition to the need to finish occupying the territory, God’s people needed to keep what was conquered. The period of Judges shows the failure of the second generation to do that. In His mercy, God raised deliverers (called judges in the book) to defend Israel, but as the story progressed, even these judges became unfaithful, and chaos ensued. God called Samuel to be a priest, judge, and prophet simultaneously. As he grew older, though, the people realized that his children would not follow in his footsteps, and, motivated by the example of other nations, they asked for a king.

Again God adapted His plan—a move already foreseen in Deuteronomy—and allowed Israel to choose a king. Saul seemed to be the perfect fit, but his conduct revealed that he was a king according to the people’s hearts. After Saul’s rejection, David was anointed king by Samuel. God reaffirmed His promises to Abraham in His covenant with David: a great name, a place for Israel, and an offspring (2 Sam. 7:9–14). However, David and his descendants also failed miserably, leading Israel to split into two kingdoms, that were either destroyed (the northern kingdom) or exiled (the southern kingdom). Nevertheless, God still stuck to His plan and did not give up on His people.

This sequence of covenants shows a pattern of blessing, sin, and grace. It demonstrates that God’s faithfulness and loyal love (ḥesed) remained constant over the ages. Jesus inaugurated the new covenant, which, based on His merits, would not fail as did the previous ones. In the eschatological lines from Daniel to Revelation, it is clear that in Jesus, the original blessings of Genesis 1 and 2 are restored to humanity: the numerous seeds of the woman receive the kingdom. Dominion is restored to the right hands again (Dan. 7:13, 14).

**God’s Faithfulness Today**

God’s Faithfulness Today

Joshua encouraged Israel to reflect on God’s promises and past deeds to recognize His faithfulness in the present (Josh. 23:2–5).

Think about your life journey and pinpoint the seasons in which you have witnessed God’s faithfulness more vividly than in other times. Share your insights with the class.

One of the best-known verses about the faithfulness of God is Lamentations 3:23, in which Jeremiah proclaims, “Great is Your faithfulness” (NKJV). At the time of this proclamation by Jeremiah, God’s people, because of their rebellion, were in a dark place. The three fundamental pillars of the Judean society were ruined: the land, the monarchy, and the temple. But even in the face of the hard reality of exile and destruction, the prophet boldly proclaimed the words that have inspired the beloved hymn “Great Is Thy Faithfulness.”

1.	How can you see God’s faithfulness amid the hard times of life?

2.	How can the fact that God is trustworthy and dependable help you navigate life’s troubled waters when you do not see His actions clearly?

3.	Consider the immediate context of Lamentations 3:23, especially verses 22 and 24. Notice how these verses help answer the questions above. Dwell upon God’s “mercies” (ḥesed), compassion, and the hope He instills in us in the context of these verses and in light of Jeremiah’s situation. What encouragement do these verses give you?

**Our Faithfulness Today**

Our Faithfulness Today

In Galatians 5:22, faithfulness is identified as a fruit of the Holy Spirit.

1.	How can you mirror God’s faithfulness vertically in your relationship with Him?

2.	How can you mirror God’s faithfulness horizontally in your association with your fellow human beings?
