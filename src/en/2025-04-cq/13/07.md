### inQuire

In your Sabbath School class (or Bible study group), share insights from this week’s main passage and supporting verses. Consider these discussion questions with the rest of the group.

**The character of God in the Old Testament:**

1. How do you reconcile the Old Testament God of judgment and conquest with the New Testament God of love? How much of that distinction is real, and how much is wrong? Why?
2. How much delight does God take in the death of the wicked? _Read Ezek. 33:11._
3. Even after God announces judgment against the wicked, how willing is He to reverse His judgment when a sinner repents? _Read Ezek. 33:14–16._

`Personal reflection: What kind of objections have you heard against the “God of the Old Testament?” What answers did you have, if any?`

**God’s judgment on the nations:**

1. What were some of the abominations happening in Egypt and Canaan that moved God to intervene? _See Lev. 18; Ps. 106:35–38._
2. Did God require anything less from Israel than what He expected of the Canaanite nations? _See Deut. 8:19, 20; Josh. 23:16; Jer. 19:4–9._
3. How would you describe God’s responsibility as the Judge of all the earth? _See Gen. 18:25; Rev. 19:11._

**The final destruction:**

1. Why does God delay His judgments against the wicked? _Read 2 Pet. 3:9._
2. Why do you think God’s angels and people will rejoice when His judgments finally come on this world? _Read Rev. 15:3; 16:7; 19:1, 2._

`Personal reflection: What are some key lessons from the book of Joshua that you want to remember?`

### Key takeaways to remember

- God does not enjoy the death of the wicked and is quick to reverse His judgments when there is repentance.
- God is the Judge over all the earth and takes ultimate responsibility for justice in this world.
- God’s final judgments will come as a relief to angels and people who long for an end to evil and misery.
