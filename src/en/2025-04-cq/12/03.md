Israel’s story reveals how seriously God takes the sin of idolatry. This sin in particular “provoked the LORD to anger” (Judg. 2:12) and brought Divine judgments against the nation of Israel. Why is idolatry so abhorrent to God?

When Israel had just left Egypt and were worshiping at the foot of Mount Sinai, the first words God spoke to them related to worship and deity (Exod. 20:1–5). The first two commandments explicitly forbid idolatry. When God gave these commandments, He deliberately worded them in relational language and highlighted the far-reaching impact of disobedience: “For I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me, but showing mercy to thousands, to those who love Me and keep my commandments” (Exod. 20:5, 6).

When God talks about jealousy and judgment, He’s expressing two principles. First, God wants our whole hearts. Anything less than entire, loving consecration is unacceptable because it shows that we don’t acknowledge His authority. Moreover, our choices cost something. Whom we worship and serve doesn’t affect just us; it affects our children and grandchildren as well. God is not saying He will arbitrarily hunt down and destroy anyone who dares to defy Him; that’s not who He is. Instead, He’s laying out the facts: if we choose any other god but Him, that choice will detrimentally impact our families for generations to come.

Second, God despises the degrading nature of idolatry. We have only to look at the examples of the Canaanite gods and the true God to see the stark and dramatic difference between the two. While the Canaanite gods demanded the sacrifice of their followers’ children, the God of the Bible delivered His own Son to die for our sins. That alone is enough to illustrate the fundamental difference between God and idols. God is love, whereas the power behind every false god is Satan, who is driven by self-exaltation and pride.

We need to consider one other pertinent fact when exploring why God detests idolatry so vehemently: the Bible tells us that we are changed by what we behold (2 Cor. 3:18). God wanted Israel to behold Him continuously so that they could assimilate His character of love. Instead, they wandered after idols, choosing to assimilate their characters instead. The result was selfishness, murder, and brutality. The question we need to grapple with is this: are there idols in our lives?
