  title: "The Book of Joshua"
  description: "The story of Joshua and his generation is about both an ending and a beginning. After forty years of difficult wandering in the wilderness, Israel had finally come home. There was a genuine cause for celebration! However, the conquest of Canaan was also the beginning of a new adventure, a journey into the unknown, in which they had to embrace the role of being God’s chosen light bearers to the world. They were finally ready to receive what God had promised them so many years before."
