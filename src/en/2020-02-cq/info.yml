  title: "How to Know God's Will for Your Life"
  description: "The term quarter-life crisis (QLC) has been coined to describe the specific anxiety of growing up. Typically the time period starts in the late teens and ranges up to the mid-thirties and even to the early forties. According to LinkedIn research, 72 percent of young professionals have experienced some form of the crisis. Though it ebbs and flows, QLC peaks at around 26 years and nine months and lasts about 11 months. It consists of lacking a sense of direction, quality of life, and purpose. The person has a general anxiety over finances, relationships, and career. While some have attributed QLC specifically to the millennial generation (a demographic defined as those born between the early 1980s and mid-1990s), a variety of the features can be found in every generation and are specifically manifested in the years as a young adult."
