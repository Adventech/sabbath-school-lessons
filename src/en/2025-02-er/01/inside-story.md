### “I Want That Book!”

_by Laurie Denski-Snyman_

Tim was a new Bible worker, and he was afraid. He was selling Christian books on a mostly non-Christian island in Southeast Asia. Tim didn’t want any trouble with the citizens on the island.

Tim walked down a street and prayed. Then he entered a sewing shop. Tim saw four people standing in line ahead of him.

Tim waited his turn to talk with the shopkeeper. Maybe she would be interested in buying Tim’s books. Tim waited a long time. Tim wanted to leave, but something stopped him.

Tim noticed that the shopkeeper kept staring at him with a strange look on her face. From time to time, she moved over to one side of the counter that was close to the wall so she could look around the other customers and get a better look at his face.

Finally, the last customer left the store except for Tim. But before he could say a word, the shopkeeper pointed to the books sticking out of his bag. She said, “I want that book! I want that book, and I want that book!”

Tim said, “What?! How do you know that I have books for sale?”

The shopkeeper said, “I had a dream. In the dream, I saw a young man who looked the same as you. He had books with him that I needed to read. One of those books was named The Great Controversy. So, I knew that you were going to come. I knew that I must buy The Great Controversy. Do you have that book?”

Tim’s fears about having trouble as a Bible worker disappeared in an instant. He grew excited about selling books. He saw the truth of Deuteronomy 31:8, which says, “ ‘The Lord will lead you. He himself is with you. He will not fail you or leave you. Don’t worry. Don’t be afraid!’ ” (ERV). Tim knew that God went ahead of him. God made the way ready for Tim to share the Good News about Jesus and His soon coming.

_Pray for Tim and other Bible workers who are trying to reach people groups in Southeast Asia, where this story happened. Thank you for your 13th Sabbath Offering this quarter that will help share the Good News about Jesus in Southeast Asia._
