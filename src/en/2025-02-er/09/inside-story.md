### Running From Church: Part 5

_by Andrew McChesney_

Diana and Loren planned to get married. Then they found out they were going to have a baby. At the time, they were living in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Diana delayed the wedding because she didn’t want the baby to be the reason for the marriage.

After the baby was born, Diana, Loren, and the children moved to Salt Lake City, Utah, where Diana’s parents lived. Diana and Loren were sick of the party life in Santa Fe.

Diana and Loren weren’t living as Christians at this time. But Loren wanted to get married in a church. Loren chose an Adventist church and talked to its pastor. Loren also asked his father, an Adventist pastor who lived near Chicago, to perform their wedding. Both pastors had a problem with what Loren wanted because Diana wasn’t a church member, and the couple wasn’t living a Christian life. But after much prayer, both pastors decided to help Loren and Diana. Loren’s father helped get them ready for marriage. He gave them advice over the phone.

On their wedding day, Diana was surprised to see people that she and Loren didn’t know. They were church members. Diana thought, “Who comes to the wedding of strangers?” Diana’s surprise grew when the church members gave them gifts.

When Diana opened the wedding gifts at home, she found a small book named Happiness Digest. Diana thought it was a book from those three women who visited her back in Colorado. Diana started to read the book. She couldn’t put it down. When Loren came home from work, she excitedly told him, “This book is God’s truth!” The book made her want to visit the Seventh-day Adventist church and learn more about what she read.

When Diana and Loren showed up in church, members accepted her as she was. They took care of her children so she could listen to the sermon. When she heard one of the elders, or church leaders, talk about Bible studies, she told him, “I want to study.” Loren told her, “I can tell you whatever you want to know.” Loren felt ashamed that he didn’t study with her before. Diana said, “No, I want to study the Bible for myself.”

The elder, Lorell Herold, and his wife, Carol, came to their home every week for 28 weeks. As Diana studied, she started to change. No one asked her to change. No one preached to her about changing her life. As she learned about God’s love, her heart changed. Members also showed Diana how much they loved her.

Loren was surprised at how much Diana loved to study the Bible. He wondered what he missed growing up. He started to study the Bible on his own. Then Loren and Diana decided to get baptized together.
