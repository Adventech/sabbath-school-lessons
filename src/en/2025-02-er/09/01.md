> <p>Memory Verse</p>
> “May the people praise You, O God. May all the people praise You. May the nations [people groups] be glad and sing for joy. For You will be fair when You judge the people and rule [control] the nations [people groups] of [on] the earth” (Psalm 67:3, 4, NLV).

When we think about the end times, we often think about the beasts or wild animals and the symbols in the book of Revelation. Of course, these things are important. That’s why God included them in the Bible for us to understand (read Revelation 1:3).

At the same time, Bible truth about the end times includes so much more: sin and suffering, God’s work as Judge, the fight between good and evil, the need to be fair, attacks against God’s people, and more.

The book of Psalms also talks about these topics. In the book of Psalms, we read about Israel getting ready for war against evil armies. We read about people who try to understand why God doesn’t stop evil from happening. For sure, we all have asked this question. The book of Psalms tells us to go to God’s temple for answers. Many of the poets who wrote the book of Psalms talk about God as the One who made everything. We care about all these topics today, too. That is why we will continue to study the book of Psalms to learn more about these important Bible truths.
