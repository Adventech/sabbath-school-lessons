### “We Need You!”: Part 7

_by Diana Fish_

Loren and Diana Fish had their dream jobs. Diana worked as a business manager for growth at the Seventh-day Adventist hospital in Orlando, Florida. Loren had a job helping people. He listened to people talk about their problems and gave them advice. Both Loren and Diana loved their jobs, but something was missing. They prayed for God to lead them.

Then Diana went to a meeting for Seventh-day Adventist women. In the meeting hall, Diana stopped at the stand for Holbrook Seventh-day Adventist Indian School. Diana looked at the pottery the students made. When a woman at the stand learned that Diana worked as a business manager for growth, she got excited. The woman told Diana that Holbrook School was looking for a business manager for growth. But Diana didn’t think God was asking her to move to Arizona.

Six months later, Loren decided to go at the last minute to the 2015 General Conference meeting in San Antonio, Texas. While he was there, he visited the Holbrook School information stand. When a woman at the stand learned what he did for a living, she said, “We need you!” The woman asked Loren about his wife’s job. When Loren told the woman that his wife was a business growth manager, the woman said, “We need her, too!”

Later, Loren told Diana what happened.

Weeks later, Loren and Diana decided to visit Holbrook School. Loren and Diana spent nine hours talking with teachers and the school manager. The teachers wanted the school to be a safe place for Indian children to learn and grow. The teachers also wanted to have a Christian worker who could give advice and help to the students and be there for them whenever they needed his help. Diana slept that night in the school guestroom. In the morning, Diana saw two copies of the same book on a shelf. She saw this book before. Diana reached into her backpack and pulled out the same book, which Loren got at the General Conference meetings. The book was named Follow: Anytime, Anywhere, at Any Cost, by Don MacLafferty. Right away, Diana knew God wanted her and Loren to come to Holbrook. She prayed, “Lord, You’ll need to convince Loren, too.”

Many days later, back in Florida, Loren told Diana that he had prayed and believed God wanted them to go to Holbrook. That evening they told the manager of Holbrook School that they were interested in working there. Two weeks later, the school offered them jobs. Loren and Diana have worked at the school for the past 10 years. Diana says, “God is so wonderful! He showed me every step of the way that He is working in my life. Before I knew Him, He knew me and had a plan.”
