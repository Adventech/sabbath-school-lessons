> “The king saw Queen Esther standing in the courtyard [private space in a house or palace with a wall around it]. When he saw her, he was very pleased.

This week, we continue to look at stories that help us to understand better the Bible’s special messages about the end times. God uses these stories about real people and their experiences to help us understand things from His view. God gave us these special messages to help our faith grow strong.

We shall study the stories about two important women: Esther and Ruth. Ruth is a widow who is filled with hope after meeting Boaz, who saves her. Their marriage is a favorite love story for many Christians. Boaz’s love for Ruth shows us Jesus’ love for us. Esther is a young girl who lives in a foreign land. She learns about a plan to destroy her people and helps to save them.
