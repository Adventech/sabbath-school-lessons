### A Girl’s Religion: Part 1

_by Andrew McChesney_

When Diana was 12, she started to drink alcohol, smoke, and listen to hard rock music. Diana went to many parties. But she started to think about God.

As a child, Diana didn’t learn much about God. Her father spent a lot of time overseas in the Navy. Diana’s family moved every two or three years, as many military families did. A few times, Diana’s mother took her and her sisters to church on Sundays when they were young and lived in Florida.

When Diana was 10, her family lived in Norfolk, Virginia. She went to Vacation Bible School. A bus came to her neighborhood from the Baptist church and picked her and her older sister up. Diana learned John 3:16 and the names of the books of the Bible. Diana learned about Bible workers and respecting the Bible because God’s Word didn’t change. Diana chose to be baptized. The church helped Diana to be a spiritual person. But outside of church, life was hard. Someone was hurting Diana in secret and using her for sex. This pain would cause Diana to suffer for years.

Then the family moved again when she was 12, this time to Albuquerque, New Mexico. Many of the neighborhood children drank alcohol and smoked. Diana joined them.

At 14, Diana moved with her family to Monte Vista, Colorado. When Diana was smoking with her new friends, she sometimes talked about God. When Diana was 16, many of her friends started to take religion classes. Diana joined them. During one class, the priest or spiritual leader announced that his church had more power and control over people’s lives than the Bible did. In the past, the leaders of his church changed God’s day of worship from the seventh-day, Saturday, to the first day, Sunday.

Diana was surprised and upset. She remembered learning in Vacation Bible School that the Bible couldn’t be changed. Diana wondered, “Why do people worship on the first day when the Bible clearly says the seventh day is God’s Sabbath?” Diana decided to finish the religion classes but not to go to the church. She kept on drinking, smoking, and listening to hard rock music. Over time, these things became her life and her religion.
