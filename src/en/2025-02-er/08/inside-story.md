### Ex-Adventist Boyfriend: Part 4

_by Andrew McChesney_

Diana started to think about God again after the peaceful voice stopped her from killing herself. That Sunday, Diana took her three children to a small church in Santa Fe, New Mexico. They sat in the pew until the church musicians started to play. Diana didn’t like the music. It made her remember a bad part of her life. Diana walked out of the church with her children.

Diana’s life went from bad to worse. Thieves broke into her apartment and stole what little she owned. Soon, Diana was going to have another baby. Her mean boyfriend was the father. When he learned about the baby, he said, “I’ll give you money to get rid of it before its born.” At night, when the children were asleep, Diana sat in the dark in her living room. She was filled with shame and self-hatred. She cried out to God, “Is this what You saved me for?” Her anger turned to tears. She prayed, “Jesus. I need You.” In that instant, she felt energy fill her. The room was black, but now it seemed filled with light. Diana felt as if God was giving her a hug from heaven. Joy, peace, and love filled her. After that, Diana fell into a deep, peaceful sleep.

A few months later, she met a strange and interesting person. Loren Fish was a Seventh-day Adventist. His father was a pastor and a church planter. But during Loren’s first year of college, he left God. He started drinking and dropped out of school. He met Diana at a dance club in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and asked her for a ride home. After that, Loren wouldn’t leave her alone. He found out where she worked and visited her there. Diana wasn’t interested in dating anyone. She hadn’t left the bad relationship she was in. Also, Loren was 4½ years younger than she was. Diana didn’t want Loren to know that her life was a mess. She didn’t want to get hurt again. So, she pushed him away. Loren left Santa Fe and went to live near Chicago.

Then, Diana’s boyfriend cut her car tires and attacked her in the parking lot of the newspaper company where they both worked. That same night, Loren called Diana on the telephone. Diana was happy to hear from Loren. She remembered feeling safe with him. She told him, “You can come visit me any time you want.” Loren arrived that weekend, and he never left.
