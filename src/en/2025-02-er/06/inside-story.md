### A Cry for Help: Part 2

_by Andrew McChesney_

Diana spent the whole summer going to parties after she finished high school. She stayed up late at night, drinking and smoking. At the end of the summer, she felt tired and sick. Then she went alone to a park in Monte Vista, Colorado. Diana looked up at the sunlight in the trees. At that moment, Diana heard a voice say, “If you don’t leave here, you will die here.” Diana knew that the voice was saying she needed to get away if she wanted to live.

Diana talked with her mother about the future. Her mother asked, “What about joining the Navy?” Diana thought this idea was silly. But three months later, she joined the Navy and went to Orlando, Florida, for training. After her training, Diana sailed all over the globe. She saw many things that upset her. Every seaport was filled with gambling, people who sold their bodies for sex in exchange for pay, and much worse.

Soon, Diana met and married a sailor. She left the Navy and had three sons. Diana and her family moved to Monte Vista, Colorado, but Diana’s husband wasn’t happy with family life.

Diana became very sad. She wanted to die. At first, she wanted to get sick and die. Then, she thought about killing herself. She felt hopeless. She prayed, “God, I believe You are real. But I don’t know where You are.”

Strange things started to happen. Diana talked with people from four different faith groups. First, two young Bible workers came to her door. Diana let them into her house. One of the Bible workers opened a book and read a verse that said people with dark skin were cursed. So, they couldn’t go to heaven to live with God. Diana was very upset. As a child, she was the only white child in her class at school. That was during a time when the state of Virginia made a law that said that forcing black people to stay separate from white people was illegal. Diana knew that God loved everyone from every race group. So, she told the Bible workers, “You need to leave.”

The next day, three women came to her house. During their visit, Diana asked them about the Sabbath. One of the women answered, “We worship God every day.” Diana thought this idea was correct. So, she agreed to allow the women to visit again.

Then, a tiny old woman knocked on her door on a stormy Friday night. The woman was collecting money to help people who suffered from natural disasters. Diana gave her the money she saved in a tip jar from her job at Pizza Hut. Diana never saw the woman again. The same weekend, a friend invited Diana to church. Diana felt something evil in the church, so she ran out after the sermon.
