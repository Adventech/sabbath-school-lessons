### Unlikely Church Planter

_by Andrew McCheseny_

When Sunita got married, her new family thought she would become a Seventh-day Adventist. In her Asian country, the wife does whatever the husband says. So, her husband, Manoj, and his parents thought Sunita would accept his faith as her own.

But Sunita didn’t.

Sunita’s in-laws saw that she continued to worship false gods of stone and wood. So, they tried their best to tell her about Jesus. Sunita and her in-laws lived in the same house, so they invited her to family worship. But she wasn’t interested. No one forced Sunita to join. She stayed away from the meetings.

A year and a half later, Sunita and Manoj moved from their small town to a big city. Now Manoj tried to convince his wife to stop worshiping statues. Manoj said, “We as a family don’t believe in bowing down to worship statues. It’s not right. We shouldn’t do it.”

But Sunita didn’t know any other way of life. Manoj didn’t try to force her to stop. As time passed, Sunita had two sons. Then she became very ill. Manoj said, “Let’s go to the Adventist church. You’ve tried so many pills and other things. But nothing helps. Lets go just this one time.”

Sunita didn’t see any way out. She had no hope. So, she agreed to go. She entered an Adventist church for the first time. Really, it was the first time Sunita entered any church.

Sunita felt very good inside the church. She didn’t understand much of the sermon because the pastor preached in the English language. But Sunita thought that the church members were very loving and kind. The next week, Sunita came back to church and asked the pastor to add her name to his prayer list. The pastor prayed for her during church. After the prayer, Sunita started to feel better. Her health slowly improved. After a while, Sunita got well.

Sunita went to church every week for the next four years. Then a new assistant pastor joined the church. This pastor spoke Sunita’s language. Sunita studied the Bible with him and was baptized. From that time, she started to pray, “Let me serve You.”

_A few years later, Global Mission invited Sunita to start new churches. She was happy to accept the work. Today, Sunita is starting a new church in a poor area of her city. She started the church with prayers for people. As God answered her prayers, other people came to her to ask for prayers. Fifteen people have been baptized. Sunita says, “I never thought I would come out of my religion and get to know the true God. It was His plan to bring me out. He is using me for His glory.”_
