### Big Bucket of Butter

_by Andrew McChesney_

After someone stole the family cow, Mother got a dog to guard their new cow. Mother also wanted the dog to guard the tithe. Tithe is 10% of all the money you get. Mother’s tithe was a big bucket of butter.

The cow was the only income for Mother and her two small children while her husband was away in a Soviet prison camp. Mother lived in Tajikistan. At the time of this story, Tajikistan was part of the Soviet Union. Mother milked the cow and traded the milk for food at the market.

Then something strange happened. Mother milked the cow and told the two children to wait while she went to the market. Mother told them, “Don’t open the door.” Before Mother left home, she checked on the big bucket of butter. She made sure that the bucket was near the dog, who was tied up in the yard.

The children waited for Mother to come home. Then the gate opened. A stranger entered the yard. But the dog didn’t bark. The man was wearing Muslim clothes. He walked over to the dog. Again, the dog didn’t bark. The man picked up the butter bucket. Then he turned around and left. Later, the children told Mother about the man. But no one understood what happened.

Many years passed. Father came home from the prison camp. He started working as a pastor again. Father and Mother had five more children. Their oldest daughter, Nina, got married and had children of her own. Nina got a job cleaning the offices of a fertilizer company. Nina needed to visit the company’s accountant to get paid. When Nina went for her paycheck, she told the accountant about the bucket of butter. The accountant asked, “When did this story happen?” Nina told her. Then the accountant started to cry. The accountant asked Nina, “Do you want to know how the story ended?” The accountant said that she was one of five children who grew up in Siberia. Their parents were killed during World War II. So, the children lived with their grandmother. Times were hard, and the day came when their food ran out. Grandmother told the five children to pray with her around the empty table. After they prayed, someone knocked on the door. A man stood outside wearing Muslim clothes. He held a bucket of butter and a loaf of bread.

The accountant asked Nina to tell her more about God. In time, the accountant and her daughter gave their hearts to Jesus and joined the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

_To this day, no one knows who the mystery man was. But Liubov Brunton, Nina’s daughter, believes the man was an angel. Liubov says, “The angel took that bucket of butter from Tajikistan to Siberia in only a second. I just wonder where the angel found the bread. In heaven I will hear the rest of the story!”_
