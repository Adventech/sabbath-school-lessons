Genesis 2:23–25; Ezekiel 16:4–14; Hosea 1:2; Genesis 24:1–4; Revelation 19:1–9.

> <p>Memory Verse</p>
> “The angel said to me, ‘Write this [message]: God blesses those [people] who are called [invited] to come to the wedding feast of the Lamb.’ And he said to me, ‘These are the true words of God’ ” (Revelation 19:9, WE).

The Bible is filled with many love stories. These stories help us understand God’s plan to save us and His love for His people. Marriage is the closest and deepest of all love relationships between two people. Marriage can teach us important lessons about God’s love for us, about our relationship to Him, and how much He did to save us.

Modern ideas about love and marriage make it hard for us to understand what God is trying to teach us with marriage. Yes, sin hurt marriage in terrible ways. Even so, our experience with marriage can help us understand Bible truth and special messages about the end times. Marriage teaches us about relationships. Marriage is the same as a school. In this school, we learn important lessons about ourselves and our relationship with God.

This week, we will look at different ways the Bible talks about marriages, good and bad. We can then learn lessons from these examples to help us better understand how God loves us, even when we make mistakes. These examples about God’s love also help us to understand end-time happenings better.
