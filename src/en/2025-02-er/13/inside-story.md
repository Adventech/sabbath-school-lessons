### “Let’s Make a Deal”

_by Laurie Denski-Snyman_

Maria was happy when a homeowner invited her inside his house to look at the books she was selling. Maria was a Bible worker in a non-Christian country in Southeast Asia. Maria pulled some health books from her bag. But the man stopped her.

The man said, “I see what you’re doing. You’re bringing out the health books first. Then after you get me to trust you, you’re going to bring out the Christian books that you really want me to see. So share the Christian books first.”

Maria prayed silently in her heart. “Lord, please help me. I don’t know what to say to this man.” Out loud, Maria said, “I have books on health and religion. I want to share whatever people want to see.”

The man rubbed his chin. He said, “Let’s make a deal. If I can ask questions about your religion, and you can answer, I’ll buy all of your books.”

Maria felt worried and nervous. She took a deep breath and said, “I’m not wise enough to answer anything you ask. I need help. May I pray first?” The man agreed. Maria prayed out loud. She asked God for wisdom and knowledge in the name of Jesus.

As soon as she finished praying, the man said, “We say Jesus was a prophet or special messenger. But you say He is God. Why do you say that? How can a man become God?”

Maria didn’t pause. She said, “Many people think that Jesus started to live only when He was born on this earth as a baby. But Jesus was around years before that. Jesus was part of the Godhead. The Godhead is God the Father, Jesus the Son, and the Holy Spirit. God the Father sent Jesus to this earth as a human baby. Then Jesus became a prophet. After that, Jesus became an offering for our sins. Then Jesus became our high priest in heaven. A high priest is the top spiritual leader. So right now, Jesus goes to God to get help for us. He asks God to forgive our sins. Jesus isn’t just a prophet. Jesus is more than a prophet. He is a high priest. Not just for me, but for everyone who accepts Him.”

The man said, “That is the nicest thing I’ve ever heard.” That was his first and only question. With tears in his eyes, he bought every book Maria had. As Maria and the man said goodbye, the man said, “You really explained to me what I wanted to know. Now I look forward to reading all your books.”

_Pray for Maria and other Bible workers who work in Southern Asia. Maria’s name was changed in the story. Thank you for your 13th Sabbath Offering this Sabbath. Your offering will help us share the Good News about Jesus in Southern Asia._
