### Read for This Week’s Lesson

Matthew 12:38–42; Jonah 3:5–10; Daniel 5:1–31; Daniel 5:18–31; 2 Chronicles 36:22, 23.

> <p>Memory Verse</p>
> “Jonah said to them, ‘I am a Hebrew. I worship the Lord, the God of heaven, who made the land and the sea’ ” (Jonah 1:9, ERV).

This week, we will talk about some stories that will help us better understand the end times. We will look at stories about Jonah, the end of Babylon, and King Cyrus. Cyrus was the Persian king who made God’s people free and helped them go back to the Promised Land.

These stories show us important Bible truth. They also show us Bible truth about the end times. They have special meaning for people living before Jesus comes back. So, we can learn from these stories important information and ideas that can help us better understand “present truth.” Present truth is the Bible truth we need most for our time.

We must be careful when we look at these stories. We must try to understand them the same way that we understand Jesus’ picture stories. We should look for the most important rules and ideas. From these ideas and rules, we can learn the Bible truths that these stories are trying to teach us for the end times.
