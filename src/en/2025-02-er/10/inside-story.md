### Giving up Alcohol: Part 6

_by Andrew McChesney_

Diana took her last drink of alcohol on July 4, which is Independence Day in the United States. Diana opened a can of beer and told friends, “There’s nothing better than an ice-cold beer on a hot summer day.” She took a big drink and almost spit it out. Diana thought the beer was bad, so she got a different brand of beer. That beer also tasted awful. But a friend said both beers tasted fine. That day, Diana quit drinking. The Holy Spirit changed her. She no longer wanted to drink.

A short time later, Loren’s father baptized him and Diana at a yearly family party. Diana was surprised when she heard the baptismal questions for the first time. One question included the line, “Do you believe that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit? Will you honor God with caring for your body temple? Will you avoid the use of anything that will hurt it, including meat that isn’t clean? Will you promise not to use, make, or sell alcohol, tobacco, or other poisons?”

Diana looked at Loren and thought, “How did we miss knowing about the health message?” Diana worked at a bar in the Salt Lake City airport at the time. With big tips and easy work, bartending was one of the best jobs for people who didn’t have any special skills.

Diana’s coworkers were surprised when she told them she was quitting her job. They wanted to know why. The bartender asked many times. He and other workers were interested in her new faith. Diana got a job in another airport shop, where she made and sold cookies. The job didn’t pay as well, but Diana didn’t have to work on the Sabbath.

Diana and Loren moved to Tennessee to help Loren’s grandparents. They moved near Southern Adventist University. Diana had many spiritual challenges at this time.

One of Loren’s family members heard that Diana worked at a newspaper in the past. He asked her to come work at the university’s radio station, where he worked as the top manager. Diana didn’t want the job, but Loren asked her to pray. Diana prayed and accepted the job. She worked at the radio station for almost 10 years. Seven of those years Diana worked as the station’s business manager for growth. During that time, God helped Diana to win the fight against sins that caused her to suffer since she was hurt in bad ways as a child.

Then Diana was asked to be the business manager for growth at an Adventist hospital in Florida. Diana didn’t feel she had enough experience to get the job. Again, Loren told her to pray. She worked in the hospital for the next 10 years. Then she heard about Holbrook Indian school.
