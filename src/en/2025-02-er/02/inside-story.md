### The Milk Miracle

_by Andrew McChesney_

No cow stood in the yard when Mother got home from the market.

Mother looked around the yard. The cow was missing. She knew her two small children waited for her in the house. Mother started to cry. How could she tell her children that their cow was stolen? The milk from the cow helped them earn money. Without the cow, they will die.

Mother decided not to tell the children. She didn’t want them to see her tears. Mother walked over to some bushes and knelt down in them. There on her knees, she prayed to God. She asked the Lord to remember her husband, who was a Seventh-day Adventist pastor. He got arrested for keeping the Sabbath and was made to serve for eight years doing hard work far from their home. The family lived in Tajikistan, which at the time of this story used to be under the control of the Soviet Union. Mother thanked God for the stolen cow, whose milk she had traded for flour, potatoes, carrots, onions, garlic, tomatoes, and cucumbers at the village market.

Mother cried. “What next, Lord? How can my children and I live now without the cow?”

As Mother cried and prayed, she saw something stuck in the branches of the bushes. Mother looked closer and saw that it was some paper money. Mother prayed, “Thank You, God! You sent money to buy another cow.”

Mother dried her tears and went back to the market to look for another cow. But every seller wanted more money than she found in the bushes.

Finally, a man agreed to lower his price.

The man said, “I’ll give you my cow for your money.” His cow was the smallest, skinniest cow in the market.

Mother gave the man the money and took the cow home.

Mother prayed, “God, this cow is in Your hands.”

At home, Mother fed the cow. Her two children played with it. With food and love, the cow grew and grew. Soon, the cow made as much milk as two cows!

Liubov Brunton is the granddaughter of the Mother in this story. Liubov said, “God saved the lives of our family during this hard time.

Liubov said the miracle with the milk is powerful proof that God protects and cares for His Bible workers everywhere. The story about the cow doesn’t end here. Liubov’s grandmother was about to see another miracle. Read about it next week.

_Thank you for your offerings that support our pastors and Bible workers who share the Good News everywhere on earth._
