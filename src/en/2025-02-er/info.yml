  title: "End-Time Signs and Symbols"
  description: "During the First Gulf War (1991), a well-known Protestant writer and preacher believed that the book of Revelation warned about this war before it happened. The preacher was convinced that some of the helicopters in the war looked the same as the locusts in the book of Revelation. Locusts are a type of flying insects. “Then the star opened the hole leading to the pit. Smoke came up from the hole like [the same as] smoke from a big furnace [hot oven]. The sun and sky became dark because of the smoke from the hole. Then locusts came out of the smoke and went down to the earth. They were given the power to sting like scorpions [small animals that sting]” (Revelation 9:2, 3, ERV)."
