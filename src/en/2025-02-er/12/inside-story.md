### A Daily Fight

_by Andrew McChesney_

17-year-old Anders complained that he heard voices. Anders was a student at Holbrook Seventh-day Adventist Indian School in the state of Arizona in the United States. Loren Fish was a health worker at the school. Loren met with Anders and decided that Anders’s problem wasn’t in his mind. Teachers and school workers prayed.

But then Anders started acting the same as a person filled with demons. When Anders went home during school break, he went to an Indian festival. Back at school, the small teenager started to show super-human strength. Holbrook’s teachers had trouble controlling Anders. Other times, Anders’s eyes rolled back in his head. Then he asked the manager for the boys, “What does Legion mean?” Anders heard the word “Legion” in his head. The manager told Anders how Jesus healed a man filled with evil spirits. Jesus asked the man to tell Him his name. “The man answered, ‘My name is Legion, because there are many spirits inside me’ ” (Mark 5:9, ERV). Legion is a name that means very many. A legion was about 6,000 men in the Roman army. One of the school workers asked Anders if he would like for the teachers to pray over him. The boy said yes.

The teachers came and stood around Anders and started to pray for him. All of a sudden, the boy moaned and fell to the floor. No one was sure about what to do. Many teachers prayed out loud while other teachers sang hymns. Another group of teachers told Anders to pray, “Jesus, help me.” Anders started to laugh at the teachers. It was a strange, evil laugh.

The school’s business manager for growth was Diana Fish. Diana felt ashamed. She thought, “The devil knows that we don’t know what to do.” Diana pulled out her cellphone, and searched on Google for information on how to help someone filled with a demon. Diana found an article named “Ellen White on How to Face Evil Spiritual Powers.” Diana said, “Listen, everyone. We need to command the spirit to leave in Jesus’ name.”

Right away, a teacher commanded the spirit, “Come out in the name of Jesus.” Then Anders said, “Jesus, help me!” All the teachers cried out, “Praise God!” Anders screamed. The school’s business manager felt something the same as a strong wind go past her out of the room. Then peace filled the place. Anders lay crying on the floor. Two teachers brought in a cot. Anders slept for the rest of the afternoon. After that, Anders was better and went home. When he came back to school, the problem started again. Then Anders left the school.

_Diana said, “We continue to pray for Anders. We know he’s in a spiritual fight. The fight isn’t over. We see the worldwide war between God and Satan daily in our students’ lives.”_
