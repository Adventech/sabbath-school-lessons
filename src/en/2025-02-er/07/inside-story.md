### Death Wish: Part 3

_by Andrew McChesney_

Diana’s husband got mad when three women continued to visit the house to study their religious books with his wife. On their wedding day, he told Diana, “Don’t try to get me to go to church.” Now he told Diana not to allow the women in the house and threw out the books they gave her.

The women invited Diana to their church’s evening meetings. But Diana worked nights at Pizza Hut to help pay the bills. One of the three women pressured Diana to get a day job at a newspaper so she could come to the meetings.

As Diana studied, she learned that the women believed God made Jesus. They didn’t believe that Jesus was everlasting. When Diana read their religious books, she saw that their Jesus didn’t match the Jesus she learned about in the Bible when she was a little girl.

Then Diana and her husband separated. Diana moved with their three sons to Santa Fe, New Mexico. Diana had no child support, friends, or family. She worked full-time to pay the bills and care for her boys, who were ages 1, 3, and 5. Diana started dating a man who wasn’t nice to her. Soon she started to think about killing herself again. Not long after, she dropped her sons off at daycare and school and went to a gun shop. She bought a gun. She knew how to use it from her Navy days.

Diana sat on her couch at home. She load the gun, pulled back the hammer, and pressed it to her chest. She heard a voice say, “You’re a terrible person and a terrible mother.” Diana gripped the trigger. Her heart pumped hard. Then a peaceful voice said, “What about your kids?” Before she could answer, the nasty voice said, “Your kids will be better off without you.”

The peaceful voice said, “Your kids need you.”

Diana thought about how her death would change her children’s lives forever. Diana got angry. She came up with a plan to end her pain, but now she couldn’t do it. She cried out, “I can’t do this anymore! It’s too hard.”

The peaceful voice answered, “You don’t need to. I’ll do it for you.”

Diana put down the gun. She fell on the floor and cried until she couldn’t cry anymore. Then she called someone she trusted at work. Together, they drove into the desert to fire off the gun. Later, Diana took the gun back to the gun shop. But the owner refused to take the gun. He said, “The gun’s used.”

Diana told him he must take the gun back. She told him that she wrote him a bad check for it. Finally, the owner took the gun back and didn’t report her to the police. Diana believed he understood why she really bought the gun.
