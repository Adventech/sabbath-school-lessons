> <p>Memory Verse</p>
> “Then I heard the Lord’s voice, saying, ‘Who can I send? Who will go for us?’ So I said, ‘Here I am. Send me!’ ” (Isaiah 6:8, ERV).

God made everything (Revelation 4:11). So, everything He made is under His control. God loves us and everything He made. When we learn more about God’s love, we start to understand why sinners can’t be good enough to earn it.

This week, we continue to study about God’s love and His throne. As we do, we will think about how we, as sinners, can have a relationship with a holy God. We will look at how Jesus makes us new and brings us back to God’s throne. God plans to make us new so that we may show His praise to everyone in heaven. As we read the Bible, we find important hints that help us understand better the important and holy work that God gives to us.

God will end sin and fighting against His holy law. Then we will understand God’s love even more than we do now. God never planned for us to fall into sin. He never wanted sin to happen or for Jesus to die. At the same time, the cross shows us God’s love in the most wonderful and amazing way.
