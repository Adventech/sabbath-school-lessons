Share insights from your study this week. Include any questions you might have for the group, as well as discoveries, observations, and new understandings. Below are some questions for discussion with the rest of your study group.

`Jesus’ first response to Nicodemus (John 3:3) appears abrupt and disconnected from Nicodemus’ introduction. Why do you think Jesus started this way?`

`Since we obviously cannot reenter the womb, what do you think caused Nicodemus’ misapplication of Jesus’ words? (John 3:4)`

`How could the following verses have helped Nicodemus understand Jesus’ call for a new birth? (Isa. 64:8; Ps. 51:10; Ezek. 36:26, 27.)`

`Like Nicodemus, how can we come to better terms with our own spiritual need for a rebirth?`

`Read John 3:16 in versions you are not familiar with. Do new insights come to you?`

`In addition to what John 3:19 mentions, can you think of other reasons people cherish darkness?`

`How do our words and life reveal the love of God? What kind of ongoing influence do we have?`

`How should we respond to the gift of God’s Son to us?`

`Meditate on John 3:16–21 in a prayerful state of mind. Are there areas in your life that you choose to keep in darkness?`
