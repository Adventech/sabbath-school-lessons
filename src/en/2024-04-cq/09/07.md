Share insights from your study this week. Include any questions you might have for the group, as well as discoveries, observations, and new understandings. Below are some questions for discussion with the rest of your study group.

`What reasons can you give for Jesus including Judas in the foot-washing service?`

`How has studying John 13 affected your response to the foot-washing we practice in church?`

`Why do you think we have difficulty accepting all that Christ wants to do for us?`

`How would you explain the differences between the Synoptics’ description of the Last Supper and John’s account?`

`What do you think Jesus meant when He said to the disciples, “If I do not wash you, you have no part with Me” (John 13:8)?`

`Typically, feet were washed when the guests arrived. What lessons can you see in the fact that this foot-washing was done after the meal?`

`In what practical ways can you heed Jesus’ instruction to follow His example? (John 13:15.)`

`How would you explain Jesus’ awareness that Judas would betray Him? Was it a result of His divine foreknowledge, or did He know how to read people better than the disciples did?`

`Take a moment to enter a prayerful state of mind. Meditate on John 13:31–35. How should you be living this out? How can you begin?`
