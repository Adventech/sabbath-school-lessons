Share insights from your study this week. Include any questions you might have for the group, as well as discoveries, observations, and new understandings. Below are some questions for discussion with the rest of your study group.

`Why do you think Jesus worked a miracle that didn’t address a major or life-threatening need?`

`Place yourself in the scene at Cana and imagine hearing what happened from the servants. How would you respond?`

`What do you think about Jesus opening His ministry with the miracle at Cana? Does it give you any insight into God’s interest in our happiness?`

`Why did the money changers and animal sellers in the temple flee from one lone Galilean?`

`How do we reconcile our view of a meek and mild Jesus with One who made a whip of cords to drive the money changers out of the temple?`

`Why did Jesus choose to answer His audience in somewhat cryptic terms? (John 2:18–22.)`

`How are Jesus’ words in John 2:19–21 connected to Paul’s description of the new temple? (Eph. 2:17–22.)`

`Share an experience you’ve had that required hindsight to see God working in your life.`
