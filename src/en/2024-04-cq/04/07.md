Share insights from your study this week. Include any questions you might have for the group, as well as discoveries, observations, and new understandings. Below are some questions for discussion with the rest of your study group.

`In what ways can you invite others to “come and see” (John 4:29)?`

`Describe your experience, or lack thereof, of becoming a well of living water (John 4:14).`

`In what ways should your understanding of witnessing change based on the story of the Samaritan woman and her impact?`

`The disciples were in a better position than the Samaritan to understand Jesus’ teachings. Why were they slower to comprehend?`

`Read through the passage again, this time placing yourself within it. Imagine you’re sitting slightly off to one side, observing. What would you be thinking about Jesus’ interaction with the woman?`

`How do you understand the concept of Jesus being the Savior of the world? In what ways is He the Savior of all men (Rom. 5:18; 2 Cor. 5:19; 1 Tim. 4:10; 1 John 2:1, 2)?`

`Take a moment to enter a prayerful state of mind. Meditate on John 4:21–24. Think carefully about what it means to be a true worshiper of God. Share your insights.`
