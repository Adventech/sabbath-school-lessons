  title: "The Gospel of John"
  description: "The four Gospels present major events in Jesus’ life. What He did, where He went, and the aim of His mission and miracles were recorded for our growth and learning. To paint a cohesive picture of Christ’s life, we often blend the four descriptions into a single portrait. In this quarter, we will focus largely on the Gospel of John, one of the most treasured books in the New Testament. In this book, we gain new and distinctive insights into Jesus’ life—insights not shared in Matthew, Mark, or Luke."
