#### FORGIVEN IN EAST TIMOR

In 2017, a man tried to kill a Seventh-day Adventist store clerk in East Timor. But that man was not punished. The East Timor leaders accepted the store clerk’s decision not to punish the man who attacked him. The story has shocked the East Timor town of Lospalos. In Lospalos, people often get even with people who hurt them. It is their way of life. Even the police were shocked that the store clerk, Edu Wachumura, chose to forgive his attacker. The attacker was named Juvinil Ananias.

The attack happened after Juvinil walked into the store, drunk. He cussed at 28-year-old Edu, who worked behind the counter. Edu had just joined the Seventh-day Adventist Church after studying the Bible with the store’s owner, Zelindo João Lay. Edu kindly told Juvinil not to use bad language in the store. Juvinil then promised to kill Edu. But Juvinil backed off when he saw the other customers in the store.

“I’m going to kill you tonight!” Juvinil said. Then he headed out the door.

That night, Edu heard a knock on the double metal doors at the back of the shop. Edu went over to the doors. They were locked and chained together. Edu looked between the doors to see who was outside. Just then, a spear pierced the doors and entered the store. Edu raised his arm and blocked the spear. The top of the spear cut off the tip of his nose.

Two days later, police came to the store to ask Edu if he wanted his attacker to go to jail. Edu shook his head no. “I forgive the man,” he said.

The police put Juvinil in jail for a week anyway. Then they let him go. So, two years later, Edu met Juvinil at the Lospalos police station. Police officers watched in surprise as Edu signed a paper announcing that he forgave Juvinil. Juvinil told Edu that he felt bad about his actions.

“I am sorry,” Juvinil said. “Thank you.”

In 2019, the judges finally announced that Juvinil was forgiven for his crime.

Zelindo, the store manager, hopes that the surprised local community will understand that God wants to forgive them just as Edu forgave Juvinil. After the attack, Edu’s brother and sister were baptized. Zelindo hopes many more people will follow their example.

“Everyone is talking about Edu’s decision to forgive. No one understands it,” Zelindo said. “It is the power of God!”
