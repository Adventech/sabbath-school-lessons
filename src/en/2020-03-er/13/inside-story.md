### A WOMAN WHO HAD A BABY INSIDE HER BELLY FOR TWO YEARS

Fanta Camara was excited when she saw the bump on her belly. But as the bump grew big, she started to feel sick. So she went to the hospital in Conakry, Guinea. A doctor examined her belly. “You aren’t going to have a baby,” he said.

Fanta didn’t believe the doctor. She asked a nurse in her family to look at her. “There is a baby in your belly,” she said. “You will have a baby!”

Fanta was happy but still sick. The family member wasn’t sure how to help Fanta. So Fanta went to another hospital. The doctor there said, “You are not going to have a baby.” Fanta visited a third hospital. “You are going to have a baby,” the doctor said. But he didn’t know how to help Fanta. As the weeks passed, Fanta felt worse. She could hardly walk.

Five months passed. Then a stranger showed up in her bedroom. He had a man’s feet and legs. But he had a leopard’s face and chest. Fanta was scared. “You will not have that child in your belly!” the stranger said. He turned and walked out the bedroom wall. Or at least it looked that way to Fanta.

The next night, the stranger again showed up in her bedroom. “You will not have that child in your belly,” he said. Every night he visited Fanta and said the same awful words.

A year passed. Then two years. Fanta felt awful. Then she remembered Tranqulle Fassinadouno. He was the only Christian in her neighborhood. So Fanta stayed away from him. But Fanta was in deep trouble. Tranqulle was a Global Mission worker. He heard Fanta’s story. Then he prayed and ate no food for three days. During that time, Tranqulle asked God for wisdom.

Then Tranqulle went to Fanta. He opened his Bible to Ephesians 6:12 and read, “Our fight is not with people. It is against the leaders and the powers and the spirits of darkness in this world [on this earth]. It is against the demon world [powers of darkness] that works in [against] the heavens [God’s government]” (NLV).

Tranqulle said, “All spirits who do not confess the name of Jesus Christ leave right now in the name of Jesus Christ.” Then Tranqulle turned to Fanta and said, “If you see that evil spirit again, you must command it to leave in Jesus’ name.”

That night, Fanta lay on her bed when the evil spirit showed up again. Before he said anything, she said, “Leave in the name of Jesus Christ.” The evil spirit disappeared. It never came back again.

Three days later, Fanta’s baby was born. It was a healthy baby girl. “I believe in Jesus now,” Fanta said.
