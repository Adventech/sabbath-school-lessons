#### THE LAST WORDS OF A DYING WOMAN

Tomasz Karauda is a 28-year-old Seventh-day Adventist doctor in Poland. A woman was brought to him from another part of the hospital where he worked. Tomasz was asked to sign a paper saying that the woman was dead. But there was one problem. The woman was alive.

The woman looked dead when the nurse brought her to Tomasz. The woman came from the part of the hospital for patients who were very sick and needed a lot of care. That part of the hospital was very crowded. The doctor there could do nothing more to save the woman. So, he sent her out so that he could free up a bed for another patient who badly needed care. A nurse asked Tomasz if the dying woman could stay in the part of the hospital where he worked.

That part of the hospital did not have any free beds. So Tomasz placed a bed in the hall. He laid the woman on it. Then he pulled up a chair next to it and talked to the woman for the next two hours.

The woman had lung cancer. She had smoked for many years. As she talked, her body started to grow hard and cold with death. The blood in her body pooled in her lower back. Her skin turned pale as her blood drained into the larger veins in her body. Nothing could be done to save her.

“I never saw anything that looked the same as this in my life,” Tomasz said. “The woman was dead. But she was sitting in the wheelchair. And she was talking with me!”

The woman said she was very sorry for her life choices.

“I spent my whole life smoking,” she said. “I wish I could go back and live my life over again.”

Tomasz felt as if he was in the middle of the Bible story about the thief on the cross. He held the woman’s hand.

Finally, the woman stopped talking. That is when Tomasz signed the paper saying that she was dead.

“Being a Christian doctor is a very responsible job,” Tomasz said. He had studied at a public medical school. “No one taught us in medical school what to do or say when something this sad happens.”

Tomasz says it is helpful to take someone’s hand and offer words of hope. But other times, he says, “the only thing you can do is hold someone’s hand and pray for him or her in your heart.”

The people on this earth are dying in sin. Many times, death sets in. Nothing can be done to save them. What will you do at that time for the dying? Will you hold their hands? Will you pray for them and with them? Will you offer them hope?
