#### AN OHIO CHURCH GETS NEW LIFE

Vince Waln, age 65, works as a money manager. He helps people save money and plan for their future. Vince also is a member of Hamilton Seventh-day Adventist Church. It is a small church in the U.S. state of Ohio. The church had only 15 members. But after three years, the church grew to about 85 people. What gave new life to this dying church? Vince says the Holy Spirit and a pipe organ!

The miracles started when Vince started preaching at the Hamilton church. Vince worshiped there when he was a child. “Not a lot of people went there anymore,” Vince says. “There was no one to play the piano for my wife, Darla, when she sang special music. She had to sing with a CD.”

One evening, Darla came home from a party for a bride at the Hamilton church. Darla told her husband that the church’s pastor was leaving his job.

“You can be their new pastor,” she told her husband.

For the next two weeks, Vince did not stop thinking about the church. He woke up at night thinking about his wife’s words: “You can be their new pastor.”

Soon after that, Vince volunteered to help the church for six months. Then the church leaders told Vince that for two weeks they prayed for him to be their pastor. That was during the same time that Vince woke up in the middle of the night. “It was the Holy Spirit working, for sure,” Vince said.

As pastor, Vince invited Jerry Taylor to be the new music manager for the church. Jerry was retired. He also was a professional organ player. Shortly after, Jerry told Vince that a retirement community was selling a pipe organ for $75,000.

“We can’t afford that!” Vince said. “We can’t even afford $5,000. It’s too much money!”

“Let’s go look at it anyway,” Jerry said.

The pastor for the retirement community was excited to learn about the Hamilton church. He stepped out of the room and came back a little while later. He said, “I spoke with the manager for our community just now. We have looked for a church to give this pipe organ to.”

So, the Hamilton church got the organ for free.

But the miracles didn’t stop there. Workers made changes to fit the organ into the church. Christians from other churches joined the church’s new choir.

Then two women walked into the church one Sabbath morning. They wanted to keep the seventh-day Sabbath after studying the Bible on their own. Later, one of the women and her husband were baptized.

God used the pipe organ to attract people. “People keep coming to our church,” Vince said.
