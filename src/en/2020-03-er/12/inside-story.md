### WHAT JESUS MEANS TO ME

The old woman listens carefully in Sabbath School in southeast Asia. You can tell that she studies the Bible a lot. She has answered all the questions in her Bible study guide. Many verses are underlined in her Bible. In class, she gives money to help the church do its work worldwide. The woman is known as “Grandmother.”

U.S. church leader Gregory Whitsett met with Grandmother after church. He asked her why she left her non-Christian religion to become a Seventh-day Adventist.

Grandmother told a sad story. When she was five years old, her parents died in an accident. Then evil spirits attacked her for many years. She went to medical doctors and to spiritual mediums. Mediums are people who talk to spirits. But the medicine they gave Grandmother only helped her for a little while.

Soon, an Adventist pastor moved next door. Grandmother watched people come to his house every Friday evening. She stood at his gate to find out what was happening. That is when she heard the music coming from his house. Peace filled her as she listened to the music each week. Then the pastor learned about her spirit problems. Grandmother agreed to let him pray for her. Soon the evil spirits left her for good. Her heart filled with thankfulness. She accepted Jesus and joined the Adventist Church.

Gregory Whitsett also is the manager of the Center for East Asian Religions. The center is part of the Adventist Church’s Global Mission work. Gregory asked Grandmother to explain what Jesus meant to her.

The old woman answered in her own language. Then a woman told Grandmother’s words to Gregory in English. “Jesus means everything to me,” she said. “He healed me. He gives me peace. I talk to everyone I meet about Jesus. I am an old woman. I don’t have much longer to live. I love Jesus so much that I decided to be Adventist in my next life too.”

Her next life? The woman who shared in English what Grandmother said was shocked. This same woman had studied the Bible with Grandmother in the past. The woman thought that Grandmother had fully stopped believing in wrong ideas from her old religion.

Grandmother’s experience is nothing new. Many people from other religions have trouble giving up old beliefs after they become Christians. That is why the Center for East Asian Religions, along with other Global Mission centers, was started. Learn more at GlobalMissionCenter.org. Please pray for the work of the centers and for people with Grandmother’s views.
