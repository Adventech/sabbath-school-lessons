#### LOYAL SOLDIER IN POLAND

The Polish army decided to replace their old jet planes with new ones. This decision made many new jobs for people. So I quit my job as a mechanic for a new job in the army.

I chose to work as an air traffic controller. I took classes for six months. But when I graduated, a doctor said that my eyesight was not good enough.

I was filled with sadness. I prayed, “Why, God?”

I ended up doing different jobs for the army. I had a lot of free time. So, I spent hours reading the Bible. A strong wish to know God grew in my heart.

At home, my wife, Aneta, joined me in reading the Bible. As we read, we saw that many verses did not agree with what we learned in our church. We read that the dead sleep in the ground. They do not go to heaven or hell after they die. We learned that the seventh day is the Sabbath.

One Saturday, Aneta and I visited an Adventist church. We decided to walk out right away if we heard anything that did not agree with the Bible. We stayed and never left.

A pastor gave us Bible studies. I was sure that soon I would need to leave the army because of the Sabbath. I did not think I could keep the Sabbath and serve in the army at the same time. But no Sabbath trouble ever came. It was easy to trade Sabbath work duties with other soldiers.

After many years, I got a chance for a better job in the army. I boldly told my new commander about my faith and how I had always kept the Sabbath.

The commander was surprised. “Why didn’t you tell me you were asking your friends to let you have your Sabbaths off?” he asked. “As long as I am in charge, you will be free every Saturday.”

Many people in the army heard about my faith. Soldiers came to me with spiritual questions. But I did not really know what a change my faith had made in people’s lives until I got ready to retire. I had worked for 29 years in the Polish army.

A commander asked me to come to his office for a private talk. He said, “I’ve started to read the Bible. I have some questions for you.”

Now I understand why God did not let me get the job as an air traffic controller. If I had taken it, I would not have read the Bible. I would not have needed to ask friends to take my duties on Sabbath. I would not have been able to share my faith with so many soldiers.

Not everything happens in life the way we want or plan. But God’s plans are best.
