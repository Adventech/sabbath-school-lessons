#### TALKING BOLDLY IN FINLAND

19-year-old Simo Vehkavuori started to think that maybe he had made a big mistake in life. This thought came to him when he visited his Seventh-day Adventist uncle and aunt in Sweden. Three years earlier Simo had made a decision at a summer camp to follow God. But Simo didn’t keep his promise to God. Now Simo was worried. He wondered, “Have I lost God’s loving-favor?”

One night, Simo went to the garden behind his uncle and aunt’s house. He knelt by a large flower bush. Tears wet his face. “Jesus, will You please accept me? If tonight is the right time to give my heart to You, please show me a sign,” he cried. “Maybe You will let a star fall.”

Simo stood and looked up. A large star fell in the night sky.

Then Simo left his aunt and uncle’s house and went back home to Finland. Soon the whole farming community heard about Simo’s decision to follow God. Some people made fun of Simo. Simo started to wonder if maybe he should not be so bold about sharing his faith with people.

One evening, a government manager came to check on his family’s farm. The government manager had heard that Simo had given his life to Jesus. She made fun of Simo as he milked the cows in the barn.

“I hope you did not become a Christian in Sweden,” she said. “You should go to dances and movies with other young people and just have fun.”

Simo looked up at the woman. “Dear friend, I met Jesus as my personal Savior in Sweden. I want to go wherever He leads me.”

Just as he finished talking, a loud bang shook the barn. Lightning struck the ground. The lightning exploded between Simo and the cow that he milked. The cow dropped dead. The other cows fell on their knees. Then the cows started to moo wildly. Simo’s rubber boots had kept him safe from the shock.

The government manager did not move. Her face was pale. Her work equipment fell in the nearby gutter filled with cow poop. At last she said, “Simo, can you forgive my careless words?” She no longer made fun of him. “Stay on your chosen road.” After a pause, she asked, “How can I get on the same road to God as you?”

Simo made up his mind not to be shy or afraid about sharing his faith ever again. In his room that night, he prayed, “Take my whole heart and life. Let me follow wherever You lead me.”
