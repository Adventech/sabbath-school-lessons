Key Text: Psalm 23:3

Study Focus: Psalm 23, Rom. 12:18–21.

#### Part I: Overview

We are starting a long but all-important journey this quarter—a journey into the meaning of suffering, evil, and death. Yes, suffering can be studied as a separate phenomenon of human existence; it can be studied from a scientific or psychological perspective in such terms as perception, affections, and consequences. However, the biblical view on suffering is much deeper. The Bible explains the origin of suffering—an origin that exonerates God from any responsibility for bringing sin into existence. The Bible also shows how God uses suffering as a transformational framework for our own enrichment, victory, and eternal life. If we imagine life as a journey, Psalm 23 is one of the best places to start, because it talks about a path. This path takes us through the highs and lows of our lives. More important, Someone is guiding us on that path. That Someone is more than a Guide; He is a caring and loving Shepherd. The most important questions for our journey, for our highs and lows, are: Do we know the Shepherd? Do we trust Him whatever happens or wherever He may decide to take us?

**Lesson Themes: This week’s lesson highlights three major themes.**

1.	It is very important to understand that our life is a journey that takes different turns.

2.	It also is crucial to remember that this path does not wind chaotically, by chance. God is our Guide and Shepherd, and He may allow us to traverse, or actively take us through, the valleys of suffering and death. But God does not expect us to make this journey blindfolded. Rather, He gives us a sure promise that He will lead us to salvation.

3.	There is no way to survive the crucibles of life if we do not trust our Shepherd to take us through them.

#### Part II: Commentary

**The Two Paths**

One biblical representation of life is of a path through a landscape. This path follows a trajectory from birth to death. There are not one but two paths. The first is the good path, the path of justice or righteousness (Prov. 8:20) that leads to prosperity and life (Ps. 1:2, 3), for God Himself makes the path smooth (Prov. 2:8, Isa. 26:7). Those who walk on the good or righteous path are guided by the divine Word that serves as a lamp for their feet when life is dark (Ps. 119:105). Eventually, their path becomes progressively brighter as the midday (Prov. 4:18). Those on this path also acknowledge God in all aspects of life (Prov. 3:5, 6). Although this path leads to life, it is narrow, and few walk on it (Matt. 7:14). The second path is the bad, or the sinful, path. This is the wide path that leads to iniquity, superficial existence, and death (Ps. 1:4, 5; Prov. 14:12; Matt. 7:13).

The paths of our lives are visible to God; He examines them (Prov. 5:21) and warns us: “Do not enter the path of the wicked, and do not walk in the way of evil” (Prov. 4:14, NKJV; see also Ps. 1:1). If someone is on the wrong, sinful path, God calls him or her to move to the good one: “ ‘As I live,’ says the Lord God, ‘I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn, turn from your evil ways! For why should you die, O house of Israel?’ ” (Ezek. 33:11, NKJV).

Two conclusions emerge from this brief Bible study:

(1) Yes, the end of each of the two paths is determined: the path of righteousness leads to life, and the path of iniquity leads to death. But being on one path or another is a matter of our choice. (2) If we decide to be on the path of righteousness, God promises that the righteous path will take us to life. Yes, the path of righteousness may be narrow; it may take us through dark mountains or valleys that may require additional light, food, persistence, patience, or strength. But the path of righteousness will end with light, happiness, and life. Through the prophet Isaiah, God promises to those who trust in Him that His path will become a highway, easy to traverse: “A highway shall be there, and a road, and it shall be called the Highway of Holiness. The unclean shall not pass over it, but it shall be for others. Whoever walks the road, although a fool, shall not go astray” (Isa. 35:8, NKJV).

**Religion as a Path**

As in other Eastern worldviews, the Bible depicts the concept of “religion” as a path or journey. Enoch “walked with God three hundred years” (Gen. 5:22, NKJV). The prophet Micah depicts a time when many people from around the world will say: “ ‘Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord. . . . He will teach us His ways, and we shall walk in His paths.’ . . . For all people walk each in the name of his god, but we will walk in the name of the Lord our God forever and ever” (Mic. 4:2, 5, NKJV). God calls His people to walk faithfully before Him (1 Kings 3:14, 1 Kings 9:4, Prov. 10:9, Zech. 3:7), and when they wander off the path, God calls them back: “ ‘Stand in the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, where the good way is, and walk in it; then you will find rest for your souls’ ” (Jer. 6:16, NKJV).

Fledgling Christianity was at first called “the Way” (Acts 9:2; Acts 19:9, 23; Acts 22:4; Acts 24:14, 22) or “ ‘the way to be saved’ ” (Acts 16:17, NIV). Apollos was “instructed in the way of the Lord” and received even more instruction while on it (Acts 18:25, 26, NKJV). The apostle Paul also associates religion with “walking” and insists that Christians can “no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles walk, in the futility of their mind” (Eph. 4:17, NKJV). The apostle John exhorts us to “walk” in God’s commandments and in His love (2 John 1:6).

Jesus declared about Himself: “ ‘I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me’ ” (John 14:6, NKJV). The combination of “way,” “truth,” and “life” constitutes three major pillars of the Christian religion. Now, we may ask, Is the Christian religion important? Is it still relevant today? It is true that the history of Christianity is littered with apostasy, abuse, deception, and corruption; numerous times Christianity took divergent routes from Christ’s path. But this does not mean there is no path of righteousness to be followed. Jesus remains the Path, and He promises us that His path is the truth and that it will take us to life, eternal life. Jesus not only is the Path; but He also is, as He says about Himself, “ ‘the good shepherd’ ” (John 10:11, NKJV). What does that mean? Jesus explains: “ ‘I know My sheep, and am known by My own’ ” (John 10:14, NKJV), including those from other folds (see John 10:16, NKJV). There is more. Jesus as “ ‘the good shepherd gives His life for the sheep’ ” (John 10:11, NKJV; see also John 10:15) and will give “ ‘them eternal life, and they shall never perish; neither shall anyone snatch them out of My hand’ ” (John 10:28, NKJV). So, following Christ on His path, the path of His righteousness, is the only and sure path to life (Acts 4:12). Even if it is narrow, even if it has crucibles, it is the only, and the best, path to life. Our Shepherd will take us there.

The Western concept and word “religion” comes from the Latin re (again) plus ligare (connect, tie)—to tie again, to reconnect. While it has been developed in the Western Christian environment, this term makes sense from the biblical perspective, too, and can be connected to the biblical view of religion as a “path” and “journey.” When humanity took the path to perdition, we lost the connection with God. Religion is that process through which humans and God are reconnected. But how do we reconnect with God? If religion is a “path” or “journey,” it is not an atemporal, ahistorical phenomenon, as in the pagan mythological or philosophical religions. Rather, in the biblical view, religion (or the reconnection of humanity with divinity) is a process in time and space. It is a personal and historical journey, both for God and for us. God comes to us and meets us where we are, in history. Another difference between pagan and biblical religions is that in pagan religions people must clear a path for themselves, to find the way to the world of the gods, to earn their favors, to reconnect to them, or to steal their secrets or the secret to eternal life. In the biblical religion, on the contrary, it is God Himself who clears the path to us. He comes to us, seeking to save us, to take us back to the path of life, to take us back to Himself. In fact, He Himself becomes the Path and the Guide and the Shepherd. He walks with us through that valley, guiding us on that path of reconnecting to God. This is God’s religion, the religion of grace!

#### Part III: Life Application

1.	Examine the path of your life. What path are you on? What can you do to ensure you are on the path of righteousness that will lead you to eternal life?

2.	Have you encountered other people on the same path as yours? Have you encountered people on a path leading the opposite way? What can you do to help others to choose the path of, and to, Jesus?

3.	We can trust our Shepherd to take us through the crucibles of life because, before permitting us to pass through crucibles, the Shepherd Himself went through that crucible. But there is an essential difference between His crucible and ours. Many of our crucibles are caused by ourselves or other humans, or by the consequences of sin in general. The Shepherd’s crucible was caused by us, and He took it upon Himself sacrificially, substitutionally, and redemptively. How does this understanding help you go through suffering?

4.	Identify two crucibles you went through recently. Identify God’s leading and care for you in those experiences.
