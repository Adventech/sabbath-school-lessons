#### Part 9: Growing in Christ

_By Andrew McChesney_

After Mother’s baptism, Father faced a severe spiritual struggle. Evil spirits possessed him at night, and he struggled to sleep. Whenever he was possessed and saw Mother, the spirits spewed hatred at her.

Father and Mother strengthened their faith by praying and studying the Sabbath School lesson every day. Father learned to pray on his knees and to have personal time with God. The couple made it a habit to pray, have personal devotions, and study the Sabbath School lesson daily.

Mother trusted God, and she felt His constant care. She found faith and assurance in the Bible, and several verses especially helped her during Father’s struggle with evil spirits. “Therefore submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you,” she read in James 4:7. “But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you and guard you from the evil one,” she read in 2 Thessalonians 3:3. She claimed the promise of Jesus in John 10:10: “The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.” When she found a Bible verse that helped or gave hope, she copied it into a special journal and prayed those verses to God during her 5:00 a.m. prayer time.

Mother also wrote a special prayer for Father that she prayed every morning for a year. She prayed, “Lord, I ask You for my husband, Eduardo, and for him to turn to You with all his heart. Help me to love him and to renew my love for him. I surrender to You, Lord, and ask You to bless him as he seeks to honor You. Discipline him when needed. Transform him into a man who will desire to follow You. Help me to encourage him and to respect him. Help me to love him. I pray this in the name of Jesus, amen.”

Father, meanwhile, started Bible studies in preparation for baptism. He wanted to be baptized on October 29, exactly a year to the day after Junior’s baptism.

As Father studied the Bible, he curiously watched YouTube sermons by preachers from the Adventist Church. He also watched sermons from other Christian denominations, wanting to test their teachings against the Bible. To his shock, evil spirits taunted him as he listened to the other preachers, saying that they would have sent him to one of their churches rather than the Adventist Church if they had known that he was interested in those preachers.

Father stopped watching the other sermons. Now I know that I’m in the right church! he thought.
