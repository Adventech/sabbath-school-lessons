Key Text: Galatians 5:22

Study Focus: 1 Samuel 26; Ps. 37:1–11; Rom. 5:3–5; Rom. 15:4, 5.

#### Part I: Overview

Hope and meekness, as essential tools for overcoming crucibles, are both defined by waiting. However, the concept of biblical waiting is not only about waiting but also waiting with patience. This patience is not a political stratagem but is part of the fruit of the Spirit. God’s people wait patiently in the crucible, because God Himself is patient. God is patient because He is loving in character and because He also chooses the best moment to intervene. But that best moment is calculated by God to offer as much time as possible for the salvation of as many people as possible. Again, waiting is possible only when we trust the One for whom we are waiting.

**Lesson Themes: This week’s lesson highlights two major themes.**

1.	We understand that patient waiting is part of the fruit of the Spirit and is crucial in our overcoming crucibles.

2.	Waiting patiently becomes possible when we know and trust the person we are waiting for.

#### Part II: Commentary

**The Patience of God**

One biblical expression that describes God’s patience is “slow to anger” (Neh. 9:16, 17; see also Exod. 34:6, Num. 14:18, Ps. 103:8, Jon. 4:2, Nah. 1:3). Notice that most of these texts place the expression “slow to anger” in the context of other divine descriptions, such as God is “abundant in lovingkindness,” “compassionate and gracious,” “merciful.” In addition, the Bible presents God as “putting up” with people (Gen. 18:17–33; Num. 14:27; Deut. 8:2; Neh. 9:30, 31; Ps. 78:38; Isa. 42:14; Ezek. 20:17; Acts 13:18; 1 Pet. 3:20). At the same time, it is emphasized that God is “abounding in goodness and truth” (Exod. 34:6, NKJV) and is the Author of “wondrous deeds” (Neh. 9:17, NASB). At the same time, He “by no means clears the guilty” (Num. 14:18, NKJV; see also Nah. 1:3, 1 Pet. 3:20).

Thus, clearly God’s patience is not to be confused with indifference, powerlessness, or undecidedness. Neither is God’s patience a facade for calculating the best time for revenge. Rather, God is patient because He abounds in love for us and wants to save as many as possible. Paul asks us rhetorically: “Or do you despise the riches of His goodness, forbearance, and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?” (Rom. 2:4, NKJV; see also Rom. 9:22–24). Peter also declares that “the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation” (2 Pet. 3:15, NKJV) because “the Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance” (see in the larger context of 2 Pet. 3:9, NKJV).

**Our Patience**

The biblical explanation of God’s patience will help all Christians, and especially us as Seventh-day Adventists, to understand the delay of the second coming of Jesus. In addition, it will help us evaluate and grow our own patience. A brief, noncomprehensive biblical study on patience produces several points:

1.	The Bible teaches that patience is an integral part of Christian life and comes from God. God clothes us with patience, together with mercy, humility, and meekness, because “Christ is all and in all” (Col. 3:11, NKJV), and because God has “elected” us (see Col. 3:12). Jesus works in us His patience (1 Tim. 1:16). We are patient because of the “calling” that God extended to us (Eph. 4:1, 2; 2 Tim. 4:2). Christian patience is part of the fruit produced by the Holy Spirit (Gal. 5:22). It comes in a package with other Christian virtues, such as love, hope, and meekness (Gal. 5:22; Col. 3:12; Eph. 4:1, 2; 2 Tim. 4:2). Love is patient (1 Cor. 13:4), and our hope enables us to wait with patience (Rom. 8:25). We are strengthened through patience with joy (Col. 1:11), and patience produces character (Rom. 5:3, 4; James 1:3, 4).

2.	Patience is a key characteristic of the end-time remnant of God: “Here is the patience of the saints; here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus” (Rev. 14:12, NKJV; see also Rev. 13:10). The remnant understand that they must be patient until the coming of the Lord in the same way that a farmer is patient until the harvest is ready (James 5:7, 8; see also Luke 8:15, Heb. 6:12, Heb. 10:36, Rev. 14:14–20). We take courage from God’s injunction to Habakkuk that even if, at times, certain end-time prophecies may appear to be far from their final fulfillment, we must persevere in our waiting: “The vision is yet for an appointed time; but at the end it will speak, and it will not lie. Though it tarries, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry” (Hab. 2:3, NKJV). God calls us to “be still, and know that I am God” (Ps. 46:10). David insists that a believer must learn to “wait on the Lord; be of good courage, and He shall strengthen your heart; wait, I say, on the Lord!” (Ps. 27:14, NKJV).

3.	In the meantime, an entire cloud of witnesses in patience cheers us on the way: “Therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God” (Heb. 12:1, 2, NKJV). Among the great examples of patience are Abraham (Heb. 6:15) and the prophets and Job, who prove “that the Lord is very compassionate and merciful” (James 5:11, NKJV). Jeremiah decided to wait on the Lord, no matter what: “I say to myself, ‘The Lord is my portion; therefore I will wait for him’ ” (Lam. 3:24, NIV), because “the Lord is good to those who wait for Him, to the soul who seeks Him” (Lam. 3:25, NKJV).

Paul explains that the examples we have in the Scriptures are appointed to help us develop our endurance and give us hope (Rom. 15:4, 5). Numerous other men and women of faith, both during and after the New Testament times, patiently endured tribulation and courageously bore God’s name and cause: “And you have persevered and have patience, and have labored for My name’s sake and have not become weary” (Rev. 2:3, NKJV; see also Rom. 12:12, 2 Tim. 2:24, 2 Thess. 1:4, Rev 1:9, Rev. 2:19, Rev. 3:10). Of course, Jesus is our greatest Example of patience and meekness in suffering: “Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow His steps: ‘Who committed no sin, nor was deceit found in His mouth’; who, when He was reviled, did not revile in return; when He suffered, He did not threaten, but committed Himself to Him who judges righteously” (1 Pet. 2:21–23, NKJV).

4.	Yes, there are practical aspects of patience for this life: its opposite, impatience, ruins our present lives, and makes us fools (Prov. 14:29; Prov. 15:18; Prov. 16:32; Prov. 25:15; Eccles. 7:8, 9). But patience is that virtue that God gives us in the crucible of tribulation that helps us overcome and secure eternal life. In His teachings about tribulation in the world, Jesus instructs us: “ ‘By your patience possess your souls’ ” (Luke 21:19, NKJV). The apostle Paul declares that God will give “eternal life to those who by patient continuance in doing good seek for glory, honor, and immortality” (Rom. 2:7, NKJV). Through the prophet Isaiah, God promises us: “But those who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint” (Isa. 40:31, NKJV; see also Ps. 37:7–9, Ps. 40:1).

**Patience Is Trusting**

Ian lay in the hospital with cancer. It was a hard winter, with extremely low temperatures. One morning, when the nurse entered his room to check on him, Ian told the nurse that his wife, Anastasia, would come to visit him that day. The nurse replied: “I do not think so, it is minus 30 degrees outside!” The man retorted: “I know my wife, and I trust her. She is special! When she promises something, she will fulfill that promise no matter what!” One hour later, Anastasia walked into Ian’s hospital room. Later that day, the nurse told Ian: “I seriously doubted your wife would come. But now I know she is indeed special!” Our waiting is determined by our knowledge of, and trust in, the person we are waiting for. If we know God and trust Him, our waiting will not lead us to despair, but rather to a patient, and active, waiting.

#### Part III: Life Application

1.	Our patience manifests itself—and, indeed, we sorely need it—in various aspects of life: family, business, health, spirituality, et cetera. However, our genuine patience will always be rooted in the fruit of the Spirit. Write down an evaluation of your patience in various areas of your life. What have you discovered? In which areas of your life can it be improved? How can you make that happen, with God’s help?

2.	Impatience is considered a characteristic of immaturity. Children generally find waiting difficult; mature people are able to wait more easily. The mature have been enabled by experience and by trust to wait patiently. Evaluate your spiritual maturity. How do you plan to continue growing in your patience?
