#### Part I: Overview

We must seek first the kingdom of God (Matt. 6:34) because He is the Creator and Keeper of all things (Gen. 2:7, Ps. 119:91). He is our Shepherd (Psalm 23), our very present help in trouble (Ps. 46:1). It is better to trust in Him (Ps. 118:8) than in people (Ps. 17:5).

Jehoshaphat trusted in God and the prophets amid national crisis (2 Chron. 20:20). The remnant of God should, and will, likewise trust (Rev. 12:17, Rev. 19:10, 2 Tim. 3:14–17). Such trust in divine power promotes spiritual security and prosperity in the church. On the other hand, David sought security in the number of men he had (1 Chron. 21:1–14) for military purposes (1 Chron. 21:5), with tragic results.

The Bible teaches us that, along with trusting God, we must be prudent (Prov. 6:8, Prov. 27:22). Thus, our lives should be modest, temperate, and without ostentation (1 Tim. 2:9). Laying up material possessions may cause undue anxiety, overshadowing one’s happiness in this life. Such anxiety puts us at risk of losing our faith. Thus, we must guard against loving and trusting more in riches than in God (Prov. 11:28, 1 Tim. 6:10).

Additionally, money may lose its value for us at any time, because eventually we will not be able to buy or sell (Rev. 13:17). Ultimately, money will be consumed in the fire (2 Pet. 3:10–12), together with the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life (1 John 2:15–17). Being faithful now in tithes and offerings is one of the ways we return to God (Mal. 3:7, 8), whom we are to fear all the days of our life (Deut. 6:2). In so doing, we prepare to overcome in the time of the great tribulation.

#### Part II: Commentary

Even though the great tribulation is a time of deep anguish and affliction for God’s people (Ps. 34:19, John 16:33), we must remain faithful (1 Cor. 4:2).

**Trust in God as Daily Preparation**

Ever since sin entered this world (Gen. 2:17), life has been filled with thorns and thistles (Gen. 3:16–19), oppression (Eccles. 4:1), sorrow, and grief (Eccles. 2:22, 23). But we must trust in God and move forward in faith, strengthening ourselves for greater trials yet to come (Jer. 12:5). A life of dependence on and faithfulness to God in the small daily trials serves as preparation for still greater trials to come. He who is faithful in that which is least will be faithful also in much (Luke 16:10).

Therefore, honor God now with your offerings of gratitude. Likewise, fulfill your vows (particularly those you made in baptism), because God promises to answer and deliver His faithful ones in the day of trouble and tribulation (Ps. 50:14, 15). The word “tribulation” (in Hebrew: tsarah) literally means “tightness,” in the sense of trouble, adversity, affliction, anguish, and distress, which affects the wealthy and the poor, believers and unbelievers alike. But we have the assurance in our trials that God provides solace and answers to our petitions, according to His will (1 John 5:14).

**Faithful in the Perplexities of Wealth**

Sometimes money issues deprive us of sleep (Eccles. 5:12), attract thieves (Matt. 6:19), bring false friends (Prov. 14:20, Prov. 19:4), give rise to greed (Eccles. 4:8, Eccles. 5:10), and may lead to self-conceit (Prov. 28:11) or indifference toward others (Prov. 18:23). We cannot set our heart on riches (Ps. 62:10). Additionally, bankruptcy (Prov. 5:14, Prov. 27:24) may sometimes be unavoidable and painful. So it always is wise to remember that it is better to have little in the Lord than much with trouble (Prov. 15:16).

Jehoshaphat had riches and armies, but they were no match for the unexpected crisis that threatened him. This crisis was greater than anything he could prepare for. However, Jehoshaphat trusted in God and prophetic guidance, and his story became a testimony of great divine deliverance (2 Chron. 20:1–22). This incredible story is a lesson for the Adventist Church to trust in God and in the prophetic guidance it has received (2 Chron. 20:20, Eph. 4:11–13, Rev. 12:17, Rev. 19:10).

In contrast, we have the story of David, who incurred the displeasure of God for his presumption. Even with all the evidence of divine watchcare in his past, David sinned by numbering the people (1 Chron. 21:1–14) without consulting his prophet (1 Chron. 21:1–4, 9–13). We may think that we don’t need prophetic guidance. How quickly we see our folly when chaos descends. The fact that divine wrath and judgment came upon the people (2 Sam. 24:1; 1 Chron. 21:7, 11, 12) shows that, somehow, they shared in the king’s sin.

In the Hebrew mindset, God is ultimately in control of everything (Dan. 4:35, Isa. 46:10). Not even a sparrow perishes without the Father knowing (Matt. 10:29). Everything happens only by divine permission or will, which, at the same time, respects individual choice and responsibility (2 Sam. 24:11, 12; Deut. 30:19).

When Pharaoh hardened his own heart (Exod. 8:15, 19, 32), the Bible at times ascribed this action to God (Exod. 10:20, 27; Exod. 11:10), showing that God permitted Pharaoh to make his own choices. God restricts evil, but, ultimately, the individual makes the decision and bears the responsibility for his or her choices.

In David’s case, it was not forbidden, neither was it a sin, to number the people (Num. 1:2, 3, 19). But in this particular instance, the act of numbering was a sin (1 Chron. 21:8), possibly because David trusted in the illusion of military might (1 Chron. 21:5) instead of trusting in the true Source of strength: God (Jer. 17:5). The lesson here for us is that God is above all things. We need to go to Him first, before resorting to human means of deliverance.

Knowledge, power, fame, physical beauty, and positions of influence, without the fear of the Lord, may lead to negative consequences similar to those resulting from acquiring riches without the blessing or help of God. Therefore, we need to appreciate divine wisdom more than any material gift (Prov. 2:1–6, Prov. 4:7, Prov. 8:11).

**Faithful in the Perplexities of Poverty**

An excessive lack of money also causes harm, given that it has the opposite effect of riches. The poor are persecuted (Ps. 10:2), despised (Prov. 14:20, Prov. 19:7), and exploited (Deut. 24:14). That is why those who are wise pray for balance (Prov. 30:8).

God is Lord of the rich and the poor (Prov. 22:2). He doesn’t despise the poor for being poor, because His own Son came as a poor Man among the poor (2 Cor. 8:9). Neither does God favor the rich because they are rich, for all riches are His (Hag. 2:8). Instead, God requires all His children to be faithful stewards of His means (1 Cor. 4:2, Rev. 2:10).

We should remember that the reason to trust in divine help is that God is Creator of “heaven and earth” (Ps. 121:1, 2). This same reason was introduced by Melchizedek before receiving Abram’s tithe (Gen. 14:19, 20) and was the motive for the patriarch’s rejection of the riches of wicked Sodom (Gen. 14:22, 23).

**Relying on God Is a Learning Experience.**

In the biblical teaching method, learning (in Hebrew: lamad) involves theory and practice, as shown in the religion of ancient Israel. According to Deuteronomy, learning should take place by hearing (Deut. 4:10), teaching the congregation (Deut. 4:5, 14; Deut. 31:12), singing God’s words (Deut. 31:19, 22), and reading (Deut. 17:19). Additionally, learning should be transmitted to children by speaking to them while they sit, walk, lie down, and rise up (Deut. 11:19), thus encouraging communion with God and trust in His covenant.

The above passages frequently link the words “learn” (lamad) and “practice,” indicating that learning takes place by experiencing God’s truth and fearing Him. In this sense, tithes and offerings also were, and still are, divine instructions, as they teach commitment to God’s work (Mal. 3:8–10), as well as to honor and praise (Heb. kabad) His name (Prov. 3:9). The general learning objective of the religious activi­ties in Israel is repeated in the second tithe consecrated to family devotion and charity: “ ‘that you may learn to fear the Lord your God always’ ” (Deut. 14:23, NKJV). (See Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 530–536.)

**Faithfulness in Preparing for the Trials of the Last Days**

In the last days, people will be lovers of money. We must shun their influence (2 Tim. 3:1–5) because covetousness is idolatry (Eph. 5:5). John warns us that idolators will be left out of the Holy City (Rev. 22:14, 15). Additionally, legal measures one day will prevent God’s people from buying and selling (Rev. 13:11–17), and all that was withheld from the Lord, together with the treasures of Babylon (Rev. 18:10–16), will perish in the fire (2 Pet. 3:3–10).

Death is unexpected. The lack of awareness among the dead of a sense of time until the coming of Jesus makes death a sleep (1 Thess. 4:13, 14; 1 Cor. 15:52). Thus, we always need to be faithful in everything while we still draw breath. From our own perspective and experience, Christ’s coming will be as soon as the day of our death, for the period between death and the resurrection will be like the blinking of an eye. The final reward then will be given to each one, according to their works (Matt. 16:27).

Daily communion with God and modest living must be life’s rules because we don’t know what hour the Lord will come (Matt. 24:42, 44).

#### Part III: Life Application

In these last days, times have been perilous (2 Tim. 3:1). With this peril in mind, remind your students that God requires them to fulfill two sacred duties: (a) advancing God’s kingdom on this earth and (b) staying faithful during trials and persecution.

**A. God’s Followers Must Give Heed to the Advancement of God’s Work.**

“The work of God is to become more extensive, and if His people follow His counsel, there will not be much means in their possession to be consumed in the final conflagration. All will have laid up their treasure where moth and rust cannot corrupt; and the heart will not have a cord to bind it to earth.”—Ellen G. White, Counsels on Stewardship, p. 60.

`How can you be more faithful with your means? In what ways are you withholding the Lord’s portion, which will “be consumed in the final conflagration”?`

`Lot’s wife looked back to the possessions that held her heart; thus, she met a tragic end (Gen. 19:26). What can you do so that your heart will “not have a cord to bind it to earth” and so that you will not look back as Lot’s wife did?`

**B. We Must Be Faithful Amid Hardships.**

“When the Light of the world passes by, privilege will be discerned in hardship, order in confusion, success in apparent failure. Calamities will be seen as disguised blessings; woes, as mercies.”—Ellen G. White, Education, p. 270.

`Even those who are faithful go through trials (John 16:33). Ask a student to share with the class how he or she learned to depend fully on God in a time of tribulation. How did this experience teach your student that God is fully in control of everything and works all things out for his or her good? How did this experience increase your student’s trust in God and in His faithfulness? Ask other students to share with the class the lessons they learned from this class member’s experience.`
