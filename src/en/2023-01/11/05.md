The parables and teachings of Jesus, the stories of Bible characters, and the counsel of Ellen G. White all indicate clearly that there is no halfway commitment to Christ. Either we are or we are not on the Lord’s side.

When asked by a scribe which commandment was the greatest, Jesus answered, “ ‘ “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength” ’ ” (Mark 12:30, NKJV). When we give all to Christ, there is nothing left for another master. That is the way it is. That is the way it must be.

`Read Matthew 6:24. What has been your own experience with the truth of these words?`

Notice, Jesus didn’t say that it was hard to serve God and money, or that you needed to be careful in how you served both. He said, instead, that it _couldn’t be done_. Period. This thought should put a bit of fear and trembling in our souls (Phil. 2:12).

`Read 1 John 2:15–17. How are these three things manifested in our world, and why is the danger they present sometimes more subtle than we realize?`

No wonder Paul wrote, “Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth” (Col. 3:2). Of course, that’s easier said than done, because the things of the world are right here before us every day. The lure of “all that is in the world” is strong; the pull for immediate gratification is always there, whispering in our ears or pulling on our shirt sleeves—or both. Hasn’t even the most faithful Christian felt some love for “the things of the world”? Even with our knowledge that one day it will all end, we still feel the pull, don’t we? The good news, however, is that we don’t need to let it pull us away from the Lord.

`Read 2 Peter 3:10–14. How should what Peter says here impact how we live, including what we do with our resources?`
