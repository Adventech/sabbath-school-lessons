#### Cambodia: Motorbike for Jesus

Matthew 5:16 “Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.”

Seyha (SAY-HUH) lives in the city of Siem Reap, Cambodia. The city is known worldwide for its ancient Buddhist temple complex called Angkor Wat. Tourists come from around the world to see the expansive ancient carved buildings.

Seyha is a tour guide and is known for his honesty and love of Jesus. Seyha takes tourists to the ancient sites around the city by motorbike. This unique travel adventure gives Seyha opportunities to share his faith with his clients while he shows them the ancient buildings.

Through his business, Seyha has met people of many different faiths and worldviews. He wants to witness to people who have never entered a church. His way of giving tours has made him well known among tour guide companies who hire him. His employers know that he does not drink or work on Sabbath.

“My regular clients know that I’m an Adventist,” Seyha says. “If a company wants to hire me, but wants me to work on Sabbath, or won’t allow me to share my faith, I won’t take the job, no matter how much money they offer.”

Seyha’s integrity takes first place over making money. One day, a man booked Seyha’s tour service. The customer had used other tour services before, and the man knew that the other tour guides had charged $25 to rent a room in a certain guest house. But when the man asked Seyha how much the room would be, Seyha answered $13. Surprised, the man said, “But I’ve always paid $25 to stay here.” Seyha told him that the hotel charged only $13 and it was against his principles to charge him more.

“Why?” the man asked.

Seyha answered simply, “Because I follow Jesus, and God wouldn’t be pleased if I cheated someone.”

Later, the customer sent a message to Seyha saying, “Thank you for showing me what it means to be a true follower of God. I’m reading my Bible now because of your testimony.”

_God can trust Seyha to be a strong example of a faithful follower of Jesus. We, too, can be a clear example of God’s love in every aspect of our life, including returning our tithes and giving an honest Promise offering—a percentage of our regular._

_\income determined between God and each of us. Trust God to provide your needs, and He will bless you abundantly._
