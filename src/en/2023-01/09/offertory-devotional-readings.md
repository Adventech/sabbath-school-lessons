#### Ethiopia: Getting to Know Jesus

John 9:4 “I must work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day; the night is coming when no one can work.”

Talessa has lived in the rugged hills of Ethiopia his entire life. Most of the country’s 85 million people live outside the cities, surviving on the food they manage to grow in the dry, dusty soil. Each day Talessa travels by foot many miles to meet with his neighbors and church members. He speaks their language; he knows their struggles; he is trusted by those around him. Talessa is a Global Mission pioneer.

After sharing a Bible lesson and prayer, Talessa continues his journey to the next home. At times the next home is an eight-hour journey. The believers have a church for their growing congregation—a church Talessa built with his own money.

Many people from this region of Ethiopia worship idols. They are haunted by superstition and fear. Talessa tells them the story of Jesus and how He delivered people from devils when He walked on this earth. Talessa invites them to learn more about Jesus, the Son of God, who loves them and wants them to live with Him forever.

Around the world thousands of pioneers like Talessa are working to share God’s message of love with those around them. With your support, Talessa is finding many who are hungry to know that God is more powerful than the devil, that their idols are worthless. So, he treks over the hillsides of Ethiopia, sharing God’s love to anyone who will listen.

Please pray for our Global Mission pioneers and the people they work with. The call to go and tell the world that Jesus is coming soon cannot be maintained or expanded unless believers continue to give our offerings on a regular basis.

_Our offerings should ideally be given as a Promise—a covenant with God—faithfully, regularly giving a covenant proportion of our earnings to support the programs that God has instituted to reach every person on this earth so Jesus can come._

_If your Promise offering is distributed as suggested by the Combined Offering Plan (which is recommended and promoted by the General Conference), then 50 to 60% help support the missionary work of your local church, 20 to 30% support the regional missionary endeavors of your conference, and 20% always supports the World Missionary Fund (or World Budget), producing balanced support to all the world missionary endeavors of the church. It is our duty to go, to pray, and to give so that others have an opportunity to meet Jesus in heaven one day._
