#### Georgia: The Little Missionary

Hebrews 13:15-16 “Therefore by Him let us continually offer the sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of our lips, [d]giving thanks to His name. 16 But do not forget to do good and to share, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.”

Luka and his parents live in Georgia, a small country that once was part of the Soviet Union. Luka’s father is a pastor, so Luka has grown up loving Jesus.

One day at church, his father announced that he was going to hold some special meetings to introduce people to Jesus. He urged everyone to invite someone to the meetings. Luka knew exactly who he would invite to the meetings—his kindergarten teacher!

Luka loved his teacher, Ms. Keti. He wanted her to learn to love Jesus just like he did. The next school day Luka invited Ms. Keti to the meetings and gave her a card that contained information about the meetings. Ms. Keti said she would try to attend.

Luka was thrilled when he saw Ms. Keti enter the church the first night. Luka welcomed her and offered to sit with her so she would not feel alone. Ms. Keti came to the meetings regularly. She told Luka and his parents that the messages were just what she needed.

Near the end of the meetings, Ms. Keti told Luka’s father that she wanted Jesus to live in her life and asked how she could become an Adventist. Luka was so happy that the teacher now loved Jesus too.

Ms. Keti visited the children’s class in church and learned that the children in Georgia had no Bibles or Sabbath School lesson to read in their own language. That made it hard to remember the stories the teacher told in Sabbath School. Then a special part of our Promise offering from church members around the world helped the Adventists in Georgia buy Bibles and print the children’s Sabbath School lessons in Luka’s language. Now the children in Luka’s church can read their Bibles and their Sabbath school lessons in their own language.

Luka is glad to have a Bible and Sabbath School lessons to help him learn more about God. He shares his lessons with his friends at school and invites them to come to church with him to learn more about God. He’s also glad that church members around the world have an offering plan—giving tithes and Promise offerings regularly and systematically as regularly as they give the tithe—helping members and missionaries in other countries tell people about Jesus.

_Even children can become Promisors, knowing that no matter what percentage of our income we dedicate to God as a Promise offering, besides the tithe, He will bless us._
