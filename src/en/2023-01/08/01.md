### Read for This Week’s Study
Eccles. 12:1; Gen. 2:15; 1 Tim. 5:8; Col. 3:23, 24; Gen. 39:2–5; Prov. 3:5–8.

> <p>Memory Text:</p>
> “And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ” (Colossians 3:23, 24, NKJV).

Most people want to live a “successful” and happy life. Of course, in a fallen world, where tragedy and calamity can strike at a moment’s notice, this goal might not always be easy to attain.

Then, too, there is the question of how we define “success.” There is the case of Joseph in Egypt; if there ever were a successful life, that certainly would be one, would it not? From prison to palace, that kind of thing. On the other hand, what about John the Baptist? He went from prison to the tomb. How successful was his life? Again, it all depends upon how you define “successful.”

This week we are going to look at the idea of “success” in the context of basic stewardship and financial principles. No matter who we are or where we live, money and finances are going to be a part of our life, whether we like it or not. What, then, are some steps, practical steps, that we can take along the way that, though not guaranteeing “success,” can nevertheless help us avoid common pitfalls and mistakes that can make financial success a bit more difficult?
