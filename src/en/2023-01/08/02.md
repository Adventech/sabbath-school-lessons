`Read Ecclesiastes 12:1. What’s the message there for us?`

As youths mature into adulthood, thoughts will arise about having to provide for basic needs—food, clothing, and shelter. Jesus Himself has told us how to prioritize our needs when He said, “But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you” (Matt. 6:33). Of course, for those who are older and who didn’t make a choice for Jesus when they were young, there is still time to make the right decisions regarding stewardship.

As we saw in Genesis 28:20–22, Jacob had made some important life choices, both spiritual and financial. In the vision, the Lord introduced Himself to Jacob as “ ‘the Lord God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac’ ” (Gen. 28:13, NKJV). Then as part of his vow to God, Jacob said, “ ‘The Lord shall be my God’ ” (Gen. 28:21, NKJV).

`Read Genesis 29:9–20. What is important about the timing of this event in the life of Jacob?`

After Jacob made his spiritual and financial commitments to God, the Lord directed him to Rachel at the well (see Gen. 29:9–20). It is fitting to make your spiritual decision and your lifework decision before committing to marriage. Your future spouse should know “what they are getting into.” Is this person a committed Christian? What type of work will he or she be involved in? Will this person be a teacher, a nurse, a lawyer, a laborer, whatever? What kind of life will I be committing to? Other questions that need answers before the marriage commitment are: What level of education has been completed? What amount of debt will come into the marriage? Am I willing to accept this situation as part of my responsibility?

`Read 2 Corinthians 6:14, 15. Why is this principle so important to consider when looking for a life partner? Though it doesn’t guarantee a good marriage, why would it help make the chances of a good marriage greater?`
