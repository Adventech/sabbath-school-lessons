As human beings (and whether we like it or not), an eternity awaits us. And according to the Bible, this eternity will come in one of two manifestations, at least for each of us individually: either eternal life or eternal death. That’s it. No middle ground. No straddling, a bit of one side or another. Instead, it is one (life) or the other (death). This truly is a case of all or nothing.

`Read Romans 6:23 and John 3:16. What options are presented to us?`

It is hard to imagine two starker or more distinct choices, isn’t it?

Chances are that if you are reading this, you have chosen eternal life, or certainly are thinking about it. God has the unique ability to do whatever He says He can do—to fulfill all His promises. Our part is simply to believe Him, rest upon the merits of Jesus, and by faith obey His Word.

`Read John 14:1–3. What is the Lord’s counsel to us in verse 1, and what does He promise to us in verses 2 and 3?`

In the final days of His earthly ministry, Jesus spoke these amazing words of hope and courage to His disciples. These words would lift their spirits in times of discouragement and trial. They should do the same for us. Jesus came from heaven, went back to heaven, and has promised us, “I will come again and I will receive you unto Myself so you can be with Me there” _(see John 14:3)_.

And, perhaps more than anything else, Christ’s death on the cross at His first coming is our greatest assurance of His second coming, for without the Second Coming, what good was His first one? As sure as we are that Jesus died for us on the cross is as sure as we can be that, yes, as He promised: “ ‘I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I am, there you may be also’ ” (John 14:3, NKJV).

`Dwell more on the idea that Christ’s first coming is the guarantee of His second. What happened at His first coming that makes His second a promise that we can trust?`
