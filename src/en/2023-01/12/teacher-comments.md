#### Part I: Overview

God promises His people earthly and eternal rewards (Deut. 28:1–6; Ps. 58:11; Mal. 3:10–12; Rom. 2:6, 7), according to their deeds (Rom. 2:6, 7; Titus 2:13, 14). Such rewards furnish us with ample motivation to be faithful (Rev. 2:10, Rev. 21:1–7).

People who are dead in sin (Eph. 2:1–6) can’t render faithfulness. Nor are they capable of good works (Isa. 64:10). But God raises us to new life in Christ (Eph. 2:5, 6), bringing salvation by grace to those who surrender to Him (Titus 2:11). He works in us to will and to do of His good pleasure for the salvation of our souls (Phil. 2:12, 13) and for the salvation of others.

Those who are justified by faith in Christ (Rom. 5:1, 2) receive eternal life (Titus 3:7) apart from any works they do (Rom. 3:28; Eph. 2:8, 9). However, grace makes us new creatures in Christ, refashioned “unto” good works (Eph. 2:10). In this sense, all good works are fruits of faith that God gives (Eph. 2:8), and the works of salvation (James 2:14) are, in fact, wrought by God Himself (Isa. 26:12).

Stewardship is implied in material and spiritual blessings, for “all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee” (1 Chron. 29:14), including obedience unto salvation. All who are faithful in using their time, gifts, body, and material possessions are debtors to the grace of God, because they are willing instruments moved by His love (1 Cor. 13:1–3, Gal. 5:6). Ultimately, the merit necessary for the redeemed to obtain the everlasting reward also is God’s, who works “all in all” (1 Cor. 12:6, NKJV; also read Phil. 2:13).

#### Part II: Commentary

**Rewarded by What God Has Done**

The Bible uses different words with distinct meanings for salvation. One of the terms is “reward” (in Hebrew: shakar) in the sense of payment for a contract, salary, fare, maintenance, or compensation (Isa. 62:11, Isa. 40:10). Another word (in Hebrew: eqeb) means “a consequence of,” “a recompense,” as a result of obedience to God’s commandments (Ps. 19:7–11).

In the New Testament, the Lord is identified as the Rewarder (in Greek: misthapodotes), Remunerator, and the One who pays wages (Heb. 11:6). He will give the redeemed their reward (Rev. 22:12). This reward will be according to the work they did in this life (in Greek: ergon). Work, here, can mean one’s business or occupation, as well as an act, deed, or undertaking (Rev. 22:12).

Conversely, the gift (in Greek: karisma), which is the gift of eternal life, is opposed to the wages (in Greek: opsonion) of sin (Rom. 6:23). Originally “wages” referred to a soldier’s ration, stipend, or pay (Rom. 6:23). Karisma indicates that salvation is a gift (Rom. 6:23) and that good works are from God (Eph. 2:10). However, death is a wage paid by the works (of sin) performed without God.

Likewise, salvation as a reward or payment is karisma (a gift). This gift doesn’t come from personal works (in Greek: ergon) but from the grace given us to do good works (ergon) (Eph. 2:8–10). By contrast, human works are sin, and its wages (opsonion) are death (Rom. 6:23, Gal. 5:19–21). The question must be asked, Who brings forth good works? Without a doubt God Himself, through His grace. God’s grace yields the work of faithful stewardship in the life of the believer; however, the flesh yields only the works of perdition.

**Rewarded Because They Are Children**

The faithfulness of the saints comes from the fact that they are children, born again through conversion. Adam and Eve were God’s children in Eden, where they were only stewards of the land that God commanded them to till (Gen. 2:15). This arrangement remained in force after sin came into the world (Gen. 3:23) because the land really belongs to the Lord (Gen. 14:19, 20; Ps. 24:1). As God’s children, Adam and Eve originally were created to be faithful stewards, free from the condemnation of sin.

However, sin has made us children of wrath (Eph. 2:3). The divine Parentage is restored (John 1:12) by the grace of Jesus, and we become sons and daughters of God again (2 Cor. 6:18). The Greek word diatheke (testament) emphasizes the unilateral relationship of a testament (Heb. 9:15), in which those who become children receive, by faith, salvation as an inheritance from the Father (Rom. 8:16, 17). They receive this inheritance, not as strangers (Eph. 2:12, Col. 1:21), nor by works of the flesh, but by faith (Rom. 4:4, 5). Thus, the faithful stewardship of our gifts, time, tithes and offerings, and our strength grows out of a relationship experience between the Lord and us, His stewards. This covenant relationship between the Father and His children begins with the new birth and continues in fellowship with God.

Furthermore, in Greek, the concept of steward (oikonomos) (Luke 12:42; 1 Cor. 4:1, 2; 1 Pet. 4:10) denotes someone who takes care of the business or properties of another and must render account to receive his due reward. There also are obligations, blessings, or curses in this covenant relationship (in Hebrew: berith). Faithfulness to the covenant depends on God’s grace and not on human beings. By renewing the cove­nant through conversion, God once again writes His law in our minds and hearts, and we become His people (Jer. 31:31–34).

**The Prize and the Crown Are Gifts.**

The reward of the redeemed is presented in the Bible as a “prize” (in Greek: brabeion) given to the winners in ancient public stadium games (1 Cor. 9:24, Phil. 3:14) and as a “crown” won in a competition (1 Cor. 9:25). The attainment of this reward involves perseverance and self-­sacrifice on the part of the Christian (1 Cor. 9:26, 27).

The assurance of our victory doesn’t prevent affliction during the journey. Like Jesus, who, being the Son, chose to do the will of the Father, despite affliction and suffering (Heb. 5:8), we also, being God’s children, will endure sorrows in this life (Phil. 1:29, John 16:33). We do so without taking our eyes off the prize, even though that means we must resist and abstain from everything harmful, as an athlete does.

The Bible also teaches that all we have, in the natural world, belongs to God. We can live, move, and exist only in Him (Acts 17:28). Additionally, every perfect gift is from Him (James 1:17). Similarly, because all material gifts come from God, every good work in the spiritual realm also comes from Him (Eph. 2:10).

Thus, the merit for the reward given to the redeemed belongs solely to God, who works in the faithful to will and to do of His good pleasure (Phil. 2:13). The redeemed are rewarded for accepting, and not giving up on, God’s work in their lives, for they believe that Jesus (John 6:28, 29) is “the Author and Giver of everything everywhere” (Eph. 1:23, TLB).

**Complete Stewardship as a Reward**

Christian stewardship is practical spirituality and faithfulness (1 Cor. 4:2), as showcased by the work of Adam and Eve in their unfallen state in Eden. Eden, which was lost by the unfaithful stewardship of Adam and Eve, was restored by the perfect and faithful stewardship of Jesus, who sought first to do the Father’s will (Matt. 26:42, John 5:30). Jesus saw the result of His work and was satisfied (Isa. 53:11). As the Second Adam, Jesus restores to humanity the heavenly image, as well as the stewardship lost by the first Adam (1 Cor. 15:45–58).

The redeemed likewise will be satisfied to see not their own works but the work of Jesus in them. From now on they serve the Lord, with their eyes set on the prize (Phil. 3:14). This prize helps us understand how everything in this life is unimportant, small, and petty in comparison with the reward of the ransomed (Matt. 25:23). Life is short, the joys are often few, and there is much vanity and vexation of spirit (Eccles. 2:17). But the promises to the faithful carry endless greatness, joy, peace, and newness (Isa. 35:10). Only the faithful (in Greek: piste) who are trustworthy and trustful (1 Cor. 4:2) will, by faith, inherit the fullness of stewardship (will be made rulers over many things), happiness (in Greek: karan), cheerfulness, and the calm delight, promised to the saints (Matt. 25:21).

The Lord invites us to be faithful in that which is least and imperfect in this life (Luke 16:9–11) so that, as children, we may receive the eternal reward. How solemn is the divine invitation to faithfulness as an expression of our surrender to Jesus, who lives in us (Gal. 2:20)!

Finally, like the compass needle that always points north regardless of its position, grace also always will be the reference point for the prize of the saints. Any good work we do stems solely from God’s grace, lest anyone should boast (Eph. 2:8–10).

#### Part III: Life Application

Ask a class member to read aloud the quotations below. Then discuss with your class the questions that follow.

**The Capital and Ability Come From God.**

“God keeps a faithful account with every human being in our world. And when the day of reckoning comes, the faithful steward takes no credit to himself. He does not say, ‘My pound;’ but, ‘Thy pound hath gained’ other pounds. He knows that without the entrusted gift no increase could have been made. He feels that in faithfully discharging his stewardship he has but done his duty. The capital was the Lord’s, and by His power he was enabled to trade upon it successfully. His name only should be glorified. Without the entrusted capital he knows that he would have been bankrupt for ­eternity.”—Ellen G. White, Counsels on Stewardship, pp. 111, 112.

What do such expressions as “work out,” “be not conformed,” “be ye transformed,” “deny himself,” and “return unto me” in the Bible (Phil. 2:12–14; Rom. 12:1, 2; Luke 9:23; Mal. 3:7, 8) teach you about the role of planning and personal will in the pursuit of faithful Christian stewardship (1 Cor. 4:2)?

**Talents Are Spiritual and Material.**

“I was then shown that the parable of the talents has not been fully understood. . . . The parable [also] applies to the temporal means which God has entrusted to His people.”—Ellen G. White, Spiritual Gifts, vol. 4, p. 38.

What connection exists between faithfulness in the spiritual life and in the material life (Matt. 25:14–30)?
