We are material beings, and we live in a material world, a world that, at times, can be very alluring. You’d have to be made out of steel and synthetic oil, not flesh and blood, not to feel, at times, the lure of material possessions and the desire for wealth. At one time or another, who hasn’t fantasized about being rich or winning the lottery?

Though we all face it, and there is nothing wrong in and of itself in working hard to earn a good living or even being wealthy, none of us has to succumb to the trap of making idols out of money, wealth, and material possessions. We are promised divine power to stay faithful to what we know is right. This is important, because the temptation of wealth and material possessions has led to the ruin of many souls.

`Read Matthew 6:24 and 1 John 2:15. Though expressed differently, what’s the common theme found in both of these scriptures?`

Unfortunately, the love of the world can be so strong that people will get into debt in order—as they hope—to satisfy that love. (It never works; _see Eccles. 4:8_.)

And because debt is one of Satan’s nets that he sets for souls, it just makes sense that God would like to see His children debt-free. He has given us counsel through the Bible and the prophetic gift that will lead us to financial freedom.

`Read Psalm 50:14, 15. What attitude should God’s people live with? What does it mean to “pay your vows” (NKJV)?`

We enter into our church membership with praise and thanksgiving to our God, who has created and redeemed us. In point 9 (of 13) in our baptismal vows, we were asked, “Do you believe in church organization? Is it your purpose to worship God and to support the church through your tithes and offerings and by your personal effort and influence?” As Seventh-day Adventists, we all said yes. So, this text (Ps. 50:14, 15) is a promise to those who offer thanksgiving to God and are faithfully paying their vows.

`What do your choices tell you about how well you deal with the lure of the world? Why is working hard to earn a good living not necessarily the same thing as making an idol of wealth or money? How can we learn the difference?`
