#### Part I: Overview

The fact that God warns against debt shows us that debt has spiritual implications (Prov. 6:1–5, Prov. 22:7).

Deliverance from debt consists in placing God’s kingdom first, freeing oneself from the desire for material things (Matt. 6:33). In the divine covenant, there is prosperity and an end to debt (Deut. 28:1, 2). However, for these promises to materialize, an experience of love for God is required, which translates into obedience to His commandments, to the vows taken during baptism, including faithfulness in tithes and offerings (Ps. 50:14, 15; Mal. 3:7–12).

The creditor is lord of the debtor (Prov. 22:7), but, according to Jesus, only God should be our Lord (Mark 12:29). Therefore, by loving God and not the things of the world (1 John 2:15), we can overcome the lust and pride of life, through the grace of Christ (1 John 2:16). We should not conform to this materialistic and consumerist age, which leads to indebtedness and insolvency. Rather, we should aim to be transformed by the renewing of our minds and strive to know the perfect will of God (Rom. 12:1, 2).

God desires that we aspire to a life of contentment (1 Tim. 6:6), free from debt (Rom. 13:8). Contentment safeguards us from compromising the principles of faith to become rich (1 Tim. 6:9). Thus, we need to plan our financial obligations wisely (Luke 14:28) and also avoid taking responsibility for someone else’s debt (Prov. 6:1–5). By following these sound biblical principles, we will develop diligence and be prepared for difficult times and unforeseen situations (Prov. 6:8). When we refrain from accruing debt and from the love of money, we, as Christians, may experience the joyful blessings that God promises to the faithful (Mal. 3:10–12).

#### Part II: Commentary

God can provide relief to any debt situation. In most cases, however, God puts the solution to the debt problem in our hands. After all, we are His stewards and should act according to His will and blessing.

As Christians, we should do our best not to owe anything to anybody (Rom. 13:8). Additionally, from a creditor’s perspective, the Christian should not exploit those who need financial assistance. Bible teachings invite us to be generous and, if possible, to forgive those brethren who are unable to settle their debts (Deut. 15:1–4).

Generally, debt is a complex phenomenon with personal, sociohistorical, and spiritual aspects. As such, we will limit our comments to some practical advice that the Bible offers on the subject.

**Biblical Principles for Becoming Free From Debt**

**Part A: Put God First (Matt. 6:33).**

_1. Give Top Priority to God (Matt. 6:25–34)._ God doesn’t want us to be indebted, because He loves the prosperity of His servants (Ps. 35:27). Therefore, God should always be sought first in any debt crisis (Ps. 105:4). The debt could have a spiritual origin, and, in such a case, one should reflect on the need to confess financial sins, such as theft and usury (Ezek. 18:12, 13); greed, which is idolatry (Exod. 22:12, Col. 3:5); unfaithfulness in contracts (Rom. 1:31); love of money (1 Tim. 6:10); and unfaithfulness in tithes and offerings (Mal. 3:7–10).

Those who have diverged from the divine plan need to return to God and renew the covenant with Him (Ps. 50:14, 15; Mal. 3:7–12). To these individuals, God promises deliverance and blessings. The sincere desire to do what is right is an indication of grace at work, because “the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance” (Rom. 2:4).

We can do God’s will (Deut. 28:1, 2) only when we are under grace. For, as Paul says, “by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them” (Eph. 2:8–10, NKJV). By faith, in God’s grace, we may call upon divine help to overcome debt. Then we enjoy God’s blessings that “maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it” (Prov. 10:22).

_2. Be Holy and Sanctify Holy Things._ In the Bible, God views His people as holy, chosen, and special (Exod. 19:6, 1 Pet. 2:9). This holiness is demonstrated when His people keep His commandments (Deut. 28:9).

The tithe also is holy (Lev. 27:30–32), and the offerings are holy (Num. 18:29). In these texts, the word “holy” is kodesh. So the tithe and offerings are kodesh, which means “sanctified,” “separated for the Lord.”

To withhold the tithe and offerings is to misappropriate sacred or holy things that have been dedicated exclusively to God and thus must be returned to Him (Lev. 5:15, 16). In the Old Testament Scriptures, restitution for withholding was required before atonement with blood could take place and before the withholder could receive forgiveness (Lev. 5:16). As such, when the people withheld tithes and offerings, they separated themselves from God and failed to prosper (Mal. 3:7–10), for they had profaned holy things. God doesn’t change, and this principle of making restitution, regarding tithes and offerings (Mal. 3:6–8), is still in force.

“Hasten, my brethren and sisters, to bring to God a faithful tithe, and to bring Him also a willing thank offering. There are many who will not be blessed till they make restitution of the tithe which they have withheld.”—Ellen G. White, Counsels on Stewardship, p. 87.

**Part B: Seek Help (Prov. 15:22).**

_1. Solicit Counsel From Friends and Professionals._ Sometimes it is necessary to acknowledge the condition of indebtedness and to seek help from friends and family.

Treatment must be sought in case of debt caused by a psychological disorder (oniomania). If this is the case, it could be helpful to seek spiritual aid from one’s pastor, family members, or trusted friends. Asking for friendly support in this process may lighten the burden and encourage the decision to solve the problem.

“Before honor is humility” (Prov. 18:12, NKJV). God’s people should consider the advantages to be derived from consulting the wisdom and experience of seasoned people and financial and psychological professionals because “in the multitude of counsellors they are established” (Prov. 15:22).

“If those who have not made life a success were willing to be instructed, they could train themselves to habits of self-denial and strict economy, and have the satisfaction of being distributors, rather than receivers, of charity.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3, pp. 400, 401.

_2. Ask for Divine Help and Wisdom._ Divine help may come in the form of discernment. In the Bible, wise management is a gift from God. The wise man declares that “by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches” (Prov. 24:4, emphasis supplied). Just as the apostle recommends to “covet earnestly the best gifts” (1 Cor. 12:31), we also can ask God for wisdom to take care of our finances, especially in times of economic hardship. This search for wisdom is recommended by James (James 1:5).

The word “knowledge” in Proverbs 24:4 means perception, ability, and discernment for business dealings. Therefore, material prosperity is preceded by biblically sound business principles on how to improve the stewardship of the money that God has placed in our hands.

**Part C: What Inspired Counsel Says About Saving (Prov. 6:8).**

Be like the ant that in summer prepares its food for winter. Always set aside some money for your savings. Include in the budget a regular percentage dedicated for this purpose.

Saving for the future was wise counsel given by God to Joseph in Egypt (Gen. 41:46, 47). Save so that you can have enough for the future or for a time of crisis. Don’t spend if you really don’t need to. “From the highest to the lowest, God’s workmen are to study to economize.”—Ellen G. White, Counsels on Stewardship, p. 268.

**Part D: Make a Budget (Luke 14:28–30).**

The budget is a financial planning tool to manage income and expenditure. Budgeting is important because, without planning, it is impossible to expect success in any undertaking.

“You ought to be careful that your expenses do not exceed your income.”—Ellen G. White, The Adventist Home, p. 375.

Pray when you prepare a budget. Plan to put God first (Matt. 6:33). Be realistic and consult other family members about what is best for everyone in your family. The Bible strongly disapproves of those who fail to take care of their own: “And specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel” (1 Tim. 5:8). Include the needs of the less fortunate in your budget, because caring for them is part of “pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father” (James 1:27, NKJV).

#### Part III: Life Application

Ask a class member to read aloud the quotation below. Then discuss with your class the questions that follow.

“Many, very many, have not so educated themselves that they can keep their expenditures within the limit of their income. They do not learn to adapt themselves to circumstances, and they borrow and borrow again and again and become overwhelmed in debt, and consequently they become discouraged and disheartened.”—Ellen G. White, The Adventist Home, p. 374.

1\. The above passage alludes to a social condition of indebtedness that is increasingly common. In what way can the widespread phenomenon of debt lead many to believe that indebtedness is normal and even acceptable, despite the distress and constraints that debt usually causes? How do we respond to this situation? (See Rom. 12:1, 2.)

2\. In the divine covenant, God promised that His people wouldn’t be indebted to others (Deut. 28:1. 2). He also established the release of the indebted from their creditors every seven years (Deut. 15:1–4). The divine model was not to have poverty in order not to have debt (Deut. 15:4). Why was the divine model for Israel in terms of debt not fulfilled (Mal. 3:6–10)? In what ways could this be happening to us? Explain. How do we avoid this pitfall in our day?

3\. Some possible sources of debt:

* Debt that is beyond our control, caused by natural catastrophes, illness, and wars
* Personal vulnerability, which comes from lack of financial wisdom and experience, ability, or instruction
* Complacency as a result of bad habits, boasting, and wastefulness
* Necessary debt, which may occur because of certain business investments, home ownership, and children’s education

Consider the above points and ask your students which debt is avoidable and which can be justifiable. Why?
