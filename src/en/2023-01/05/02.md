`Read Deuteronomy 28:1, 2, 12. What is God’s ideal for His children regarding debt? How can they attain this ideal? And though this context is very different from ours, what principles can we take away from it to apply to ourselves now?`

Studies show that there are three primary reasons that people get into financial difficulty. They are listed here in the order of greatest frequency.

_The first is ignorance._ Many people, even the educated, are financially illiterate. They were simply never exposed to the biblical or even secular principles of money management. There is hope, however! This lesson will provide a simple outline of these principles and how to apply them.

_The second reason for financial difficulties is greed, or selfishness._ In response to advertising and personal desire, people simply live beyond their means. They aren’t willing to live in, drive, or wear what they can really afford. Many of these same people also feel that they are just too poor to tithe. As a consequence, they live their lives without God’s promised wisdom and blessing (see Mal. 3:10, 11; Matt. 6:33). There’s hope for these people, as well, but it requires a change of heart—and a spirit of contentment.

_The third reason people find themselves in financial difficulty is personal misfortune._ They may have experienced a serious illness without adequate health insurance. They may have been abandoned by a spendthrift marriage partner. A natural disaster may have wiped out their possessions. Or they may have been born and raised in abject poverty. There is hope for these people too. Though their path is more difficult, their troubles can be overcome. Change may come with the support of Christian friends, the counsel and/or assistance of godly counselors, hard work coupled with a good education, and the blessing and providence of God.

Whatever the reason, even if it’s a person’s own fault, debt can be alleviated. However, those in debt will need to make some changes in their lives, their spending, and their financial priorities.

`Read 1 Timothy 6:6–9. What is Paul saying here that all of us need to heed? What do these words mean to you, and in what ways can you better follow what the Word is teaching us here?`
