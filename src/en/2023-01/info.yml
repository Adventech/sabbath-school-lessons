  title: "Managing for the Master"
  description: "It is difficult for us to fully comprehend the relationship that our God, the Creator of the universe, wants to have with us as human beings. (The mere idea of it is astounding!) “Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God!” (1 John 3:1, NKJV). Or as Ellen G. White wrote: “Can any human dignity equal this? What higher position can we occupy than to be called the sons of the infinite God? . . . Can any worldly honor equal this?”—God’s Amazing Grace, p. 341. It’s only the darkness of this sin-laden world that causes us not to appreciate fully the status that we have been given in Jesus."
