#### Croatia: Two Great Loves

Exodus 35:21 “Everyone came whose heart was stirred, and whose spirit was willing, and they brought the Lord’s offering for the work of the taberbacle of meeting, for all its service ,and for the holy garments.”

Eleven-year-old Joshua has two loves: God and his violin. Long before he went to school, Joshua learned to play the violin.

At school Joshua tried to tell his friends about God. But they weren’t interested. When Joshua learned that a Vacation Bible School (VBS) was coming up, he invited his friends to attend. Some seemed hesitant, so Joshua said, “Just come! It’s great!”

Some of Joshua’s friends attended VBS, and they liked it so much that they wanted to go again. One girl, Mela, was so impressed that she told Joshua, “It’s a miracle! There really is a God!” Joshua gave Mela a Bible and now Mela and her mother are attending Joshua’s church. Mela has joined Pathfinders, and her mother goes to a women’s group at the church.

One day Joshua heard his parents talking about a boy who was very sick with a brain tumor, and his family couldn’t afford to pay for the operation that he needed.

Joshua thought for a while and then said, “I know! We can have a concert to raise money to help this boy!”

“OK,” his mother said, “but who will organize it?”

“I will!” Joshua organized everything himself. He told his friends and teachers at his music school about his idea, and 15 young musicians agreed to play in the concert. Joshua talked with his pastor, who opened the church for the concert. Soon, posters advertising the special concert were posted all over town, inviting people to come to this special fundraising program. The concert was held at the Seventh-day Adventist Church. About 300 people came to the concert, most of whom had never been in an Adventist church before.

Joshua and his friends were delighted when they learned that their concert raised 8,600 Croatian kunas (about US$1,300)! That’s more than an average person in Croatia earns in a month! Joshua and his friends were happy that they could help the sick boy and his family. Who knew that a boy and his violin could make such an impact for God? Imagine what you could do to help people around you!

_Giving faithfully to God through our talents and our Promise offerings helps people around the
world, near and far, hear God’s message of love—some for the first time. Imagine what heaven
will be like when we meet those who met Jesus because we gave out of love._
