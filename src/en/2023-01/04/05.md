`Read Mark 12:41–44. Whether we are rich or not rich, what message can we take from this story? What’s the principle that this teaches us, and how can we apply it to our own worship experience?`

Jesus and His disciples were in the temple courtyard where the treasury chests were located, and He watched those who were bringing their gifts. He was close enough to see that a widow had given two copper coins. She had put in all that she had. “But Jesus understood her motive. She believed the service of the temple to be of God’s appointment, and she was anxious to do her utmost to sustain it. She did what she could, and her act was to be a monument to her memory through all time, and her joy in eternity. Her heart went with her gift; its value was estimated, not by the worth of the coin, but by the love to God and the interest in His work that had prompted the deed.”—Ellen G. White, Counsels on Stewardship, p. 175.

Another very significant point is that this is the only gift Jesus ever commended—a gift to a church that was just about to reject Him, a church that greatly deviated from its calling and mission.

`Read Acts 10:1–4. Why did a Roman centurion receive a visit from a heavenly angel? Which of his two actions were noted in heaven?`

Apparently, not only are our prayers heard in heaven, but the motive of our gifts also is noted. The passage notes that Cornelius was a generous giver. “ ‘For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also’ ” (Matt. 6:21, NKJV). The heart of Cornelius followed his gifts. He was ready to learn more about Jesus. Prayer and almsgiving are closely linked and demonstrate our love to God and our fellow men—the two great principles of God’s law: “ ‘ “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind,” and “your neighbor as yourself” ’ ” (Luke 10:27, NKJV). The first is revealed in prayer, the second in almsgiving.
