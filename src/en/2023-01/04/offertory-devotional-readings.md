#### Albania: Mission Changed Us

Matthew 28:19-20. “Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age. Amen.”

When God called Delmar and Nati* and their three-year-old daughter Clara to serve as missionaries in Albania, the couple eagerly prepared to embark on a new adventure with God. They knew that living in a foreign country would stretch their comfort zone. It didn’t take long to learn some of the challenges they would be facing as they worked to bring the gospel to Albania.

For years, Albania had banned religion. Even today religion isn’t a priority for most people. There are only about 120 Adventists in Albania.

The family was assigned to serve in the city of Korcë [KOR - chuh]. They had great plans, but despite their efforts, few were interested in Bible studies. Delmar was discouraged. All their effort had led to nothing.

Then the family received a call to pastor a large church in Brazil. The offer seemed perfect, but Nati wasn’t so sure. “Do you think we’ve done everything we can here? I feel that God has work for us here.” The couple decided to stay and pray that God would use them.

Delmar and Nati noticed a lot of children in their neighborhood. Maybe working with children was a good place to start. The couple prepared a volleyball court and invited the children to come and play. The kids started coming to the church yard to play. They got to know Delmar and Nati. Soon the churchyard was full of kids! They just needed to get them inside the church.

Angela, one of the church members, brought her friend Fatjon [FAHT - ee - ohn] to join the fun. Fatjon and Delmar started talking about God, and then they began studying the Bible together. Delmar invited Fatjon to be part of the youth group. “Great!” Fatjon said. “I want to help these kids, to serve this community.” Soon he was helping with the kids, and the kids loved him.

Fatjon helped bring the youth together, and some began asking questions about God. Delmar was thrilled to baptize Fatjon—his first baptism in Albania!

The church’s youth group has added many new faces. The church’s Center of Influence is growing.

_As Delmar and Nati continue to serve on the front lines of Albania, we too can serve on the front lines of mission as we return our tithes and give our Promise offerings faithfully to God and His work._
