`Read Deuteronomy 16:17. Rather than a percentage, what criterion does God give as the basis for the amount of our offerings?`

Our offerings are an acknowledgment and expression of our gratitude to God for His abundant gifts of life, redemption, sustenance, and constant blessings of many kinds. So, as we noted in the passage above, the amount of our offerings is based on what we have been blessed with.

“ ‘For everyone to whom much is given, from him much will be required’ ” (Luke 12:48, NKJV).

`Read Psalm 116:12–14. How are we supposed to answer the question posed in verse 12? How does money fit in with the answer?`

How could we ever repay God for all His blessings to us? The simple answer is that we never could. It seems that the best we can do is be generous with the cause of God and in helping our fellow human beings. When Jesus sent out His disciples on a missionary trip, He told them, “ ‘Freely you have received, freely give’ ” (Matt. 10:8, NKJV). Our offerings contribute to the development of a Christlike character. We are thereby changed from selfishness to love; we are to be concerned for others and the cause of God as Christ was.

Let us always remember that “ ‘God so loved . . . , that He gave’ ” (John 3:16, NKJV). In contrast—as sure as day follows night—the more we hoard for ourselves, the more selfish in our own hearts we will become, and the more miserable we will feel, as well.

It is up to us to determine what amount we give and what entity receives our gifts. But bringing an offering to the Lord is a Christian duty with spiritual and moral implications. To neglect this is to do spiri­tual damage to ourselves, perhaps more than we realize too.

`What do your offerings, and your attitude about giving them, say about your relationship with God?`
