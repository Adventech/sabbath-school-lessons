#### Bangladesh: Joyfully Serving Jesus

3 John 1:2 “Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in health, just as your soul prospers”

Bangladesh is a country of 180 million people, but fewer than 23,000 are Adventists. That’s one Adventist for every 8,000 people in Bangladesh. The challenge of reaching the people of Bangladesh for Jesus seems impossible. But one Global Mission pioneer believes that with God’s help even one person can make a difference for God.

Ajoy Khayang, a Global Mission pioneer in rural Bangladesh, has worked with the villagers in his region for several years. When he first came, the people held tightly to their traditional religious beliefs, but Ajoy prayed that the people would let go of their gods and rituals and learn about Jesus. God paved the way to answer Ajoy’s prayers in an unexpected way.

The villagers get their drinking water from the same river where they wash their clothes and bathe. So, it was no surprise to Ajoy when the villagers became sick with diseases such as diarrhea, malaria, and cholera. With no medical services nearby, the villagers grew desperate to find a cure for their symptoms.

When Ajoy saw how seriously ill the villagers were, he called them to meet in the church for prayer every day for a week. At the end of the week Ajoy could see that many of the sick were recovering. They saw the healing also. As a result, many asked to follow Jesus. Now, most of the villagers are Christians.

The villagers are poor and illiterate, but they have hope for a better life for their children. They want to build a school and find a teacher to teach their children to read and write so they can study the Bible and have a better life. And they want to dig a well so they can have safe drinking water.

Ajoy is grateful to be a part of God’s Global Mission pioneer team. We are part of that same team, for our faithful promise offerings support the work of Global Mission pioneers in more than 100 countries. Our Promise offerings help spread God’s message of love to people who do not yet know Jesus.

_If we purpose a determined percentage of our income to be regularly given as our Promise offering, it may not represent a large offering. But if all of us do the same thing, a constant flow of resources will be sent as God blesses us, and it will water the seed of the gospel that has been planted by our faithful missionaries. God will bless what we give so our offerings can go far and encircle the world with the message of the love of Jesus._
