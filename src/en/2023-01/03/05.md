title:  Tithing on the Gross or the Net Income?

We calculate our tithe on our “income” if we are paid by the hour or by a salary, and we pay on our “increase” or profit if we are self-employed and have our own business. In many countries, the government takes out taxes from the worker’s pay to cover the cost of services done for the people, such as security, roads and bridges, unemployment benefits, and so on. The question of gross or net primarily involves whether we return tithe on our income before or after such taxes are taken out. Those who are self-employed can legitimately deduct the cost of doing business in order to determine their actual profit before their personal taxes are deducted.

Studies of membership’s giving habits reveal that the majority of Seventh-day Adventists tithe on the gross income; that is, before taxes are taken out.  In fact, according to the Tithing Principles and Guidelines, published by the General Conference in 1990, “Tithe should be computed on the gross amount of a wage or salary earner's income before legally required or other employee authorized deductions. This includes federal and state income taxes which provide for services and other benefits of responsible citizenship. Contributions to Social Security may be subtracted-See Guideline 111-F.”—Page 22.

`Read 1 Kings 17:9–16. What was the widow’s situation before Elijah came to her? What did the prophet ask her to do first before taking care of herself and her son? What can we learn from this account about the question at hand?`

The widow of Zarephath was told by God that a man of God was coming to see her (1 Kings 17:9). When Elijah arrived, she explained her dire circumstances. Elijah first asked for a drink of water and then added, “Do not fear; go and do as you have said, but make me a small cake from it first, and bring it to me; and afterward make some for yourself and your son. For thus says the Lord God of Israel: ‘The bin of flour shall not be used up, nor shall the jar of oil run dry, until the day the Lord sends rain on the earth’ ” (1 Kings 17:13, 14, NKJV).

Was this selfishness on his part, or was he simply testing her faith—in fact, allowing her to exercise her faith? The answer should be obvious.

As we have been told, “Everyone is to be his own assessor and is left to give as he purposes in his heart.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4, p. 469.

`How do you explain to someone who has never given tithe the blessings that come from giving it? What are those blessings, and how does returning tithe strengthen your faith?`
