`Read Leviticus 27:30 and Numbers 18:21, 24. What does God propose to do with the tithe?`

Because God is the owner of everything (Ps. 24:1), He obviously doesn’t need the money. But because the tithe is His, He tells us what to do with it, and that is to use His tithe for the support of the gospel ministry. And, therefore, the needs of the ministers are taken care of with God’s tithe.

The tribe of Levi—the ministerial force in the Old Testament—was not given large properties, as were the rest of the tribes. Levi was given certain cities, including the cities of refuge, with enough land around them for personal gardens. They were supported by the tithes of the others, and they themselves also tithed their income.

`Read Acts 20:35. What’s the message here, and how does this relate to the question of tithe?`

Tithing is important because it helps us establish a relationship of trust with God. To take one-tenth of your income and “give it away” (though, technically, it belongs to God anyway) truly is an act of faith, and only by exercising it will your faith grow.

Think, for instance, about the end times, too, when those who are faithful cannot buy or sell, as depicted in Revelation 13, 14 (see lesson 11). To have developed a trust in God and in His providences and power and love will be of paramount importance when it seems as if all the world is against us. Faithful tithing can surely help develop that trust. Even before then, how crucial for all of us to have learned to trust God, regardless of our situation.

A second big reason for financial faithfulness is to access the promised tangible blessings of God. As part of the tithing contract, God has promised blessings that are so large that we won’t have room enough to receive them. With our surplus, we can help others and help to support the work of God with our offerings.

`In what ways have you experienced the great truth that it is, indeed, “more blessed to give than to receive” _(Acts 20:35)_?`
