#### God’s River of Life

John 4:13-14 “Jesus answered and said to her, “Whoever drinks of this water will thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst. But the water that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life.”

Have you ever wondered what happens to your Promise offerings? Think of your offerings as a vital river flowing through the entire world, providing life-giving support to build God’s work in every mission field, locally, regionally, and internationally.

But exactly where do our offerings go? What do they achieve? And what do they support?

If your Promise offering is distributed as suggested by the Combined Offering Plan, then 50 to 60% support the missionary work of your local church, 20 to 30% support the regional missionary endeavors of your conference, and 20% always support the World Missionary Fund (or World Budget) that, among other things, provides for about 400 missionary families around the world plus some 1,600 Global Mission Pioneers.

It is also from the World Missionary Fund that our mission offerings are distributed among the 13 world divisions plus the Middle East North Africa Union Mission, the Chinese Union Mission, the Ukrainian Union Conference, and the Israel Field (which are attached fields to the General Conference) to help these regions build and sustain mission activities in their territories. Other parts of the World Missionary Fund help several church institutions that serve the world church. For instance, these funds help finance the medical mission work of Loma Linda University, the outreach of Adventist World Radio and Hope Channel, and the humanitarian ministry of ADRA, the Adventist Development and Relief Agency.

In recent years, millions of people from the most challenging areas of the world have found salvation in Jesus and have joined the Seventh-day Adventist Church. A recent study suggests that every 22 seconds someone becomes a Seventhday Adventist, and every four hours a new church is established. Thanks to your offerings and the Global Mission focus, thousands of new congregations have been established in previously unreached areas and among new people groups. But after these new believers have been baptized, how are they nurtured? Part of our Promise offerings help to disciple new believers, teaching them how to share their new faith with others in their neighborhood.

Your river of Promise offerings helps grow and sustain mission work in an equitable way, locally, regionally, and throughout the world. Please keep this life-giving river flowing. Thank you for your offerings and for your continuing prayers for God’s mission work around the world.

_Each Sabbath this year, you will be able to see or hear a story of how God works in another new region. Listen intently and pray fervently for those who are working in the fields ripe for harvest._
