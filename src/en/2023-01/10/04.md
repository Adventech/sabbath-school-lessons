In Old Testament times, many of the children of Israel were farmers and shepherds. Thus, some of God’s promised blessings were couched in farm language. For example, in Proverbs 3:9, 10, God says that if we are financially faithful to Him, our “barns will be filled with plenty” (NKJV). It is likely that many Christians don’t have a barn today. So, we understand that God will bless our work or business if we are willing to follow and obey Him.

`Read Proverbs 27:23–27. How would you interpret “Be diligent to know the state of your flocks” (NKJV) for Christians living today?`

However much the Bible warns against the rich trampling on the poor, or being greedy with their wealth, Scripture never condemns wealth or people’s efforts to acquire wealth, provided of course they don’t do it dishonestly or through oppressing others. In fact, the texts for today, in Proverbs, indicate that we should be diligent in our financial affairs in order that we may have enough for ourselves and our family. “You shall have enough goats’ milk for your food, for the food of your household, and the nourishment of your maidservants” (Prov. 27:27, NKJV).

How would we rephrase Proverbs 27:27 for today? Maybe we would suggest, “Review your financial records and determine the state of your affairs.” Or “Do a balance sheet and understand your debt-to-equity ratio.” From time to time during your earning years, it would be appropriate to review your will or other documents and your present assets and update them as necessary. Such documents as wills and trusts are put in place early in the estate-planning process in order to be a protection against untimely death, or not being able for health reasons to decide about where your assets should go. The idea is to plan ahead for what will happen to your possessions once they are no longer yours.

In short, good stewardship of what God has blessed us with doesn’t deal only with what we have while alive but also with what happens after we are gone—because, unless the Lord returns in our lifetime, we will one day be gone while our material possessions, whether a little or a lot, will remain behind. Hence, it is up to us now to make provisions so that what we have been blessed with can be a blessing to others and the furtherance of God’s work.

`“For riches are not forever” (Prov. 27:24, NKJV). Why is it important to keep this thought before us?`
