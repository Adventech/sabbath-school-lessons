#### Part I: Overview

We need to trust in God (Matt. 6:24–27) and not invest our trust and love in money (Matt. 6:24). We can take care of our possessions (Prov. 27:23), be prudent (Prov. 6:8, Prov. 10:5), and do so without anxiety (Matt. 6:34), dedicating our lives to proclaiming the power of God (Ps. 71:18). When aged and frail (Eccles. 12:1–8), we can still bear fruit for the Lord (Ps. 92:14), with His help (Ps. 71:17, 18), because He promises to take care of us (Isa. 46:4; Ps. 92:12, 14). Then we will have peace when our breath of life returns to the Creator, by whom all was made (Col. 1:16).

Our life and riches do not last forever (Prov. 27:24), our possessions will be passed on to others (Ps. 49:10), and we cannot take anything with us beyond this life (Eccles. 5:15). So, whenever possible, “a good man leaveth an inheritance to his children’s children” (Prov. 13:22); however, he must do it in such a way as to prevent disputes among them. In drawing up a will, we must not think of our own earthly interests only and fail to be generous toward God. This failure was the ruin of the foolish rich man in Jesus’ parable (Luke 12:19, 20).

When we acknowledge all that God is to us (Ps. 24:1) and live for His glory (1 Cor. 10:31), we set our mind on the unseen, which is eternal (2 Cor. 4:18). We await the city with foundations (Heb. 11:10), whose Builder and Maker is God, instead of investing all our time and attention in amassing temporary riches (1 Tim. 6:17).

By investing in God’s work (Mal. 3:8–10), we leave behind a faith legacy. Then, one day, when we rest from our labors, our good works will follow us (Rev. 14:13) because God will be glorified in them—even in our absence.

#### Part II: Commentary

**Trust in God**

All things come through God the Son and were made for Him (Col. 1:16). However, because money “meets every need” (Eccles. 10:19, NRSV), we cling to it, despite being only temporary custodians of such means. The tendency to love money (1 Tim. 6:10) is condemned in the Scriptures (Matt. 6:24).

Replacing trust in God with love for, and hope in, created things is foolishness (Jer. 5:4; Rom. 1:21, 22). The god of this age distorts our understanding of reality and blinds our mind so that God’s glory in Christ cannot be seen (2 Cor. 4:3, 4).

Without faith, we lose hope’s firm foundation (Heb. 11:1). We are assailed by the fear of death (Heb. 2:15) and anxiety (Matt. 6:34). Thus, we stubbornly hold on to things, resisting the command to return to God what belongs to Him.

If, after withholding from God what belongs to Him, we turn back to God (Mal. 3:7), faith will bring forth hope, salvation, and good works (Eph. 2:8–10). God’s love will cast out fear (1 John 4:18), and there will be hope because He will never leave us nor forsake us (Heb. 13:5).

**Prepare for the Future**

The labor in Eden was part of the Garden’s delights (Gen. 2:15). After sin, survival depended on “labor” and “the sweat of thy face” (Gen. 3:17–19). The Bible enjoins us to engage in honest labor (Exod. 20:9) and care for our possessions (Prov. 27:23), as well as to make provision for the future (Prov. 6:8, Prov. 10:5) while we are able to work.

However, we become weaker as we age (Eccles. 12:1–8), and we ask God not to abandon us (Ps. 71:18). Despite our physical decline, we can still bear fruit for God (Ps. 92:14), who promised to care for us in our old age (Isa. 46:4).

Riches do not last forever (Prov. 27:24), our possessions will be passed on to others (Ps. 49:10), and we cannot take anything with us beyond this life (Eccles. 5:15). For these reasons, we should endeavor to honor God now (Prov. 3:9, 10).

**The Blessings**

God gives us blessings and salvation, along with the commission to pass these blessings on to future generations. In the Old Testament, the word “covenant” also has the meaning of a will with conditional clauses for the beneficiaries to receive an inheritance.

In this divine will are included material blessings, such as the land of Canaan (Gen. 15:18), becoming a great nation (Gen. 12:2, Gen. 15:5), and abundant material possessions (Deut. 28:11). There also are spiri­tual promises: the Messiah (Gal. 3:16) and the commission to take these blessings to all nations (Gen. 12:3; Gal. 3:8, 14). All those who live by faith are beneficiaries of this will, receive this commission, and need not fear because they are under God’s care.

The New Testament also presents the meaning of this legacy of material and spiritual blessings from God to His people. The Greek word diatheke (Gal. 3:15–18; Heb. 9:16, 17) means the will and last wish of the testator, in the sense of a one-sided relationship. In this arrangement, the heir of faith need only accept the offer. We, who are the beneficiaries of the will (diatheke) executed with Christ’s blood (Matt. 26:28), are given the responsibility to convey to future generations the legacy of this will (Gen. 9:9, Gen. 17:9), as reflected in the patriarchal blessings (Heb. 6:13–18) and the church’s mission to preach to all nations (Matt. 28:19).

**Return the Lord’s Legacy**

All the blessings received during our lifetime should be faithfully used to glorify God (1 Cor. 10:31, Mal. 3:8–10). We glorify Him by sharing directly with, and through, the church all that He gives us. Bible examples that demonstrate this principle are as follows:

Abraham: God praised Abraham for instructing his family “after” him to continue to serve the Lord after his death (Gen. 18:17–19).

David: David appointed his son Solomon as his heir. David also ensured that his son received a material and spiritual legacy to continue the work that God had given David, which David himself was unable to accomplish personally.

After being generous with God’s work throughout his life, David, now an old man, offered the resources he had prepared, both personal and from his kingdom, to build the temple (1 Chron. 29:2, 3). This work would begin approximately three years after his death (2 Chron. 3:2) and would serve as a witness to all nations (2 Chron. 6:32, 33).

For centuries, the temple was a powerful missionary project, originally planned and funded by David, attracting millions of people to the house of prayer, and it was intended for all nations (Isa. 56:3–7). This work materialized only through the determination of David to return to God what he had received from Him throughout his life and at the end of it (1 Chron. 29:14).

David’s story shows us that our commitment to God is lifelong. If we invest in God’s kingdom in this life, as David did, we will leave behind us a legacy that will continue after our lives end. So we must put our affairs in order. This task may involve sorting through our possessions and providing for our heirs in such a way that they may continue to witness for Christ after we are gone.

**Our Part in the Covenant**

Jesus renewed the divine testament with us (Mark 14:24, Heb. 12:24) to be preached to the whole world (Matt. 28:19). As with Abraham and David, the material possessions and the spiritual legacy that God gives us should continue to promote the succession of the gospel in the family and in the church for the salvation of all nations.

The divine testament enjoins God’s people to faithfulness and generosity in tithes and offerings. Such faithful and generous giving will impress upon the nations that the blessings received by God’s people (Mal. 3:12) come from obedience to Him. The blessings should extend to the children forever (Deut. 12:28). That is why possessions also were brought to the temple during spiritual revivals (Exod. 35:20–29; 2 Chron. 31:1–12; Neh. 10:37, 38; Mal. 3:6–12) or, in New Testament times, were laid at the apostles’ feet (Acts 2, Acts 4:34–37).

“A flood of light is shining from the word of God, and there must be an awakening to neglected opportunities. When all are faithful in giving back to God His own in tithes and offerings, the way will be opened for the world to hear the message for this time. . . . Had the purpose of God been carried out by His people in giving to the world the message of mercy, Christ would, ere this, have come to the earth, and the saints would have received their welcome into the city of God.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, pp. 449, 450.

The testament (the gospel) announced to Abraham (Gal. 3:8) must be proclaimed by preaching, first to those who are closest to us (as in the time of the patriarchs) and then to the ends of the earth. Only then will both Jews and Gentiles be blessed with the legacy of faith that was passed on to us by the family or the church (Isa. 52:10, Acts 1:8, Acts 13:47). Thus, the message that “their works do follow them” (Rev. 14:13) shows us that our personal example and faithfulness with our possessions will continue to witness to future generations after we are no longer here.

#### Part III: Life Application

Our life is a living testament, communicating to future generations the sacred legacy placed in our hands. Ultimately, all that we are given is continually returned to God.

Ask a class member to read aloud the quotations below. Then discuss with your class the questions that follow.

**The Daily Testament**

“Dying legacies are a miserable substitute for living benevolence. The servants of God should be making their wills every day, in good works and liberal offerings to God.”—Ellen G. White, Counsels on Stewardship, p. 326.

How are good works and generous offerings connected to faith (Eph. 2:8–10)? Why?

**After God’s People Are Gone**

“They should arrange their property in such a manner that they may leave it at any time.”—Ellen G. White, Counsels on Stewardship, p. 328.God plans deeds since ancient times (2 Kings 19:25).

Why is it important to plan and make arrangements beforehand, especially concerning property, so that we may be ready to “leave it at any time”?

**Our Sacred Duty**

“Many manifest a needless delicacy on this point [drawing up a will]. . . . But this duty is just as sacred as the duty to preach the word to save souls.”—Ellen G. White, Counsels on Stewardship, pp. 323, 324.

How is the drawing up of a will a duty as sacred as the duty “to preach the word to save souls”? Why?
