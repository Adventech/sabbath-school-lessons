As we near the end of our earning years, our financial focus turns toward preserving our assets in anticipation of the end of life. The transition from working to retirement can be a very traumatic experience. In terms of our finances, what is the best way to proceed?

As people get older, they almost naturally begin to worry about the future. The most common fears are: dying too soon (before the famil­y is taken care of); living too long (outliving one’s assets or savings); catastrophic illness (all one’s resources could go at one time); or mental and/or physical disability (who will take care of me?).

When commenting on these fears, Ellen G. White wrote: “All these fears originate with Satan. . . . If they would take the position which God would have them, their last days might be their best and happiest. . . . They should lay aside anxiety and burdens, and occupy their time as happily as they can, and be ripening up for heaven.”—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1, p. 424.

This week we will review God’s counsel regarding our last years. What are things that we should do, what should we avoid doing, and what principles should we follow?
