#### Philippines: Warriors for Jesus

Jeremiah 24:7 “I will give them a heart to know Me, for I am the Lord; and they will be My people, and I will be their God, for they will return to Me with their whole heart.”

One early morning on the island of Mindoro, Philippines, Jaslene\* was making her family’s breakfast. Suddenly gunfire shattered the peace. Her husband, Antonio, raced into the house, grabbed his gun, and began shooting back. Government soldiers had ambushed them because they were rebel fighters.

Jaslene grabbed her children and raced into the forest, where they hid in the bushes until the shooting stopped. Jaslene and her children slipped back home. They learned that Antonio had been killed by the soldiers. Jaslene’s heart pounded with hatred. She decided to raise her children to fight and avenge their father’s death.

When the oldest boy reached 13, he joined the rebels. Jaslene taught the younger children how to survive in the jungle, how to forage for food, and how to shoot to kill.

One day Jaslene was listening to her radio while she worked. The strains of a song touched her heart: “Coming again, coming again, Jesus is coming again!”

The speaker spoke about Jesus, the kind and loving Savior. Fascinated, Jaslene stopped to listen. Her heart warmed as she heard that God loved her and offered her forgiveness. Soon she accepted Jesus as her Savior and tried to forgive her enemies. Her children followed her example, and soon they all were baptized.

One day Jaslene met the speaker of Adventist World Radio. Tearfully, she asked him, “Pastor, why did it take you so long to come and tell us this good news about God? If only you had come before my husband died. He would have given up his fighting before it was too late.” Then she added, “This broadcast must go to other villages in the mountains! They need to hear about Jesus before it is too late for them!”

Jaslene and her children have found joy and forgiveness to replace the hatred in their hearts. They encourage their friends to trade their bullets for Bibles and find that Jesus brings true joy and meaning to their lives, delivered to them on the airwaves of AWR.

_Our lives have been changed by the Savior, and we can show our gratitude and love by giving our offerings to Him faithfully. Our Promise offerings are gifts to God, not to the church, to use in reaching people for the Savior in every part of the world._
