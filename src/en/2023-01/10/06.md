Though it’s hard to know what life would have been like on earth had humans not sinned, one thing we can know for sure: there would have been no hoarding, no greed, no poverty—things that have plagued our world since recorded history. Our sense of ownership, of what we have worked for and, if we did it honestly, is rightfully ours, is nevertheless a manifestation of life in a fallen world. In the end, however, regardless of how much we do or do not own, there’s one important point that we should always remember.

`Read the following texts. What is the central point in them all, and how should that point impact what we do with whatever material means God has blessed us with? (Ps. 24:1, Heb. 3:4, Ps. 50:10, Gen. 14:19, Col. 1:15–17).`

We are stewards and managers of what God has entrusted to us; that is, He ultimately owns it all, and He is the one who gives us life, existence, and the strength to have anything at all. It is only logical, then, that when we are finished with what God has given us, and have taken care of our family, we should return the rest to Him.

“In giving to the work of God, you are laying up for yourselves treasures in heaven. All that you lay up above is secure from disaster and loss, and is increasing to an eternal, an enduring substance” “[and] will be registered to your account in the kingdom of heaven.”—Ellen G. White, Counsels on Stewardship, p. 342.

There are many advantages to giving now, while we live. Here are a few:

1.	The donor actually can see the results of the gift—a new church building, a young person in college, an evangelistic campaign funded, and so on.

2.	The ministry or person can benefit now when the need is greatest.

3.	There is no fighting among family or friends after your death.

4.	It sets a good example of family values of generosity and love for others.

5.	It minimizes estate tax consequence.

6.	It guarantees that the gift will be made to your desired entity (no interference from courts or disgruntled relatives).

7.	It demonstrates that the heart of the donor has been changed from selfish to unselfish.

8.	It stores up treasures in heaven.
