`Read Luke 12:16–21. What’s the relevant message to us here? What strong rebuke did the Lord give to the foolish man, and what should that say to us regarding our attitude toward what we own?`

Though the message is broader than this, one could argue that this was a story Jesus told about what _not to do in retirement_. Accordingly, if a person is quitting work to spend his accumulated assets on himself, he should beware and take this story to heart. The problem is not working hard or getting wealth, particularly as one gets older and, perhaps, even richer. The problem is the attitude toward it. Jesus’ words—“ ‘take your ease; eat, drink, and be merry’ ” (Luke 12:19, NKJV)—express the real issue here.

“This man’s aims were no higher than those of the beasts that perish. He lived as if there were no God, no heaven, no future life; as if everything he possessed were his own, and he owed nothing to God or man.”—Ellen G. White, Christ’s Object Lessons, pp. 257, 258.

If we think only of ourselves and ignore the needs of others and the cause of God during this stage of life, we are following the example of the rich fool. There was no indication in Jesus’ parable that the rich man was lazy or dishonest. The problem was in how he spent what God had entrusted to him. Because we don’t know the day of our death, we should always be ready for it by living to carry out God’s will instead of pursuing a life of selfishness.

The general picture given in the Bible is that a person works and remains productive as long as he or she is able. In fact, it is interesting to note that the authors of the great prophetic books of Daniel and the Revelation were, many believe, both in their 80s when they completed their work. This was at a time when the average age at death was about 50 years. Ellen G. White published some of her best-known and best-loved books, such as The Desire of Ages, after about age 70. Age, then, as long as we are healthy, should not mean that we stop being productive and, to whatever extent possible, doing some good.

Jesus counseled those waiting for His second coming not just to watch but to continue working, as well (Matt. 24:44–46).

`At any age and with any amount of money, how can we avoid falling into the trap that the man did here? Ask yourself, What am I living for?`
