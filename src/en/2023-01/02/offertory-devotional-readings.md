#### Brazil: Mission on the Amazon

Matthew 21:16 “... and said to Him, “Do You hear what these are saying?” And Jesus said to them, “Yes. Have you never read, ‘Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants You have perfected praise’?”

Vitoria is a 10-year-old girl who loves to spend time with her parents and her brother, Daniel. Yet Vitoria has done something most young girls have not. She has planted a small group that meets every week to study the Bible. But it’s not a regular small group.

Vitoria lives on a tributary of the Amazon River. One day a week she climbs into a small canoe and paddles up the river. With skill and determination, she makes her way to the house of a friend and picks him up to go to the Bible study.

Sometimes her brother goes along to help. When the canoe is full, they make their way to another island and tie their canoe to a tree. They step into the jungle and walk on fallen logs, trying not to fall off into the thick mud that covers the forest floor. They reach a small house built on stilts which overlooks the river. This is the home of another friend who welcomes the children to study the Bible so he can attend too.

The young people start with prayer. They open their small group’s study guide and read the lesson. After discussing the topic of the lesson, the group sings songs before they close with a prayer. The children say goodbye and return to the canoe to go home.

Vitoria gives a simple reason for wanting to tell her friends about Jesus: “Because I want to be in heaven with them.”

Three of Vitoria’s friends have been baptized because of her witness, and they invite more friends to their weekly Bible lessons. Vitoria eagerly awaits the day she can be baptized as well.

If a young child is willing to brave a big river to share her faith with her friends, just imagine what we can do to help spread the gospel to others. All we need is faith, courage, the Holy Spirit, and Bible study guides to introduce others to Jesus.

_The regular and systematic offerings, called Promise, make it possible for believers young and old alike to lead Bible study groups like those in South America. Let’s give our offerings faithfully so that people around the world will have what they need to share God’s love with those around them._
