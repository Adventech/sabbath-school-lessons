            '2 Pet 2; 2 Pet 1:16; 2 Pet 1:20; 2 Pet 1:21': '<h3> <span>2 Peter 2</span></h3><p><span><span>2&#xA0;</span>But there were also false prophets among the people, even as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Lord who bought them, <i>and</i> bring on themselves swift destruction. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And many will follow their destructive ways, because of whom the way of truth will be blasphemed. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>By covetousness they will exploit you with deceptive words; for a long time their judgment has not been idle, and their destruction does not slumber.</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>For if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but cast <i>them</i> down to hell and delivered <i>them</i> into chains of darkness, to be reserved for judgment; </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>and did not spare the ancient world, but saved Noah, <i>one of</i> eight <i>people</i>, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood on the world of the ungodly; </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned <i>them</i> to destruction, making <i>them</i> an example to those who afterward would live ungodly; </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>and delivered righteous Lot, <i>who was</i> oppressed by the filthy conduct of the wicked </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>(for that righteous man, dwelling among them, tormented <i>his</i> righteous soul from day to day by seeing and hearing <i>their</i> lawless deeds)&#x2014; </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup><i>then</i> the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust under punishment for the day of judgment, </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>and especially those who walk according to the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise authority. <i>They are</i> presumptuous, self-willed. They are not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries, </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>whereas angels, who are greater in power and might, do not bring a reviling accusation against them before the Lord.</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>But these, like natural brute beasts made to be caught and destroyed, speak evil of the things they do not understand, and will utterly perish in their own corruption, </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup><i>and</i> will receive the wages of unrighteousness, as those who count it pleasure to carouse in the daytime. <i>They are</i> spots and blemishes, carousing in their own deceptions while they feast with you, </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>having eyes full of adultery and that cannot cease from sin, enticing unstable souls. They have a heart trained in covetous practices, <i>and are</i> accursed children. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>They have forsaken the right way and gone astray, following the way of Balaam the <i>son</i> of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness; </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>but he was rebuked for his iniquity: a dumb donkey speaking with a man&#x2019;s voice restrained the madness of the prophet.</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>These are wells without water, clouds carried by a tempest, for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever.</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>For when they speak great swelling <i>words</i> of emptiness, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through lewdness, the ones who have actually escaped from those who live in error. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>While they promise them liberty, they themselves are slaves of corruption; for by whom a person is overcome, by him also he is brought into bondage. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>For if, after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, the latter end is worse for them than the beginning. </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than having known <i>it,</i> to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them. </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>But it has happened to them according to the true proverb: <span>&#x201C;A dog returns to his own vomit,&#x201D;</span> and, &#x201C;a sow, having washed, to her wallowing in the mire.&#x201D;</span></p><h3> <span>2 Peter 1:16</span></h3><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>For we did not follow cunningly devised fables when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of His majesty. </span> </p><h3> <span>2 Peter 1:20</span></h3><p> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation, </span> </p><h3> <span>2 Peter 1:21</span></h3><p> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>for prophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke <i>as they were</i> moved by the Holy Spirit.</span></p>'

### The More Sure Word of Prophecy

<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 1:13">1 Pet. 1:13</a>; <a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 1:16–21">2 Pet. 1:16–21</a>

The epistle was written by Peter the fisherman, called to be an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 1:1">1 Pet. 1:1</a>). He was impulsive, forward, and selfconfident, yet he was a true, loving, and faithful disciple. He was one of the most colorful in character of all the disciples, and one with whom a good many of us more readily relate in our inner and outer conflicts of personal discipline.

**[Peter] was one of the most colorful in character of all the disciples.**

How did the prophets gain their wisdom? How much did they understand of what they wrote? How is our understanding different from that of the prophets (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 1:12, 13">1 Pet. 1:12, 13</a>)? What are some things that Peter says the Bible is not (<a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 2; 2 Pet 1:16; 2 Pet 1:20; 2 Pet 1:21">2 Pet. 2; 2 Pet. 1:16; 2 Pet. 1:20; 2 Pet. 1:21</a>; )? That it is (verses 19, 21)? What do you learn about how the Bible came to us (verses 20, 21)?

Peter reminds us that all Scripture is inspired by God. This does not allow us to decide which parts of Scripture are inspired by God and which are human inventions. But what does it mean for it to be inspired, or “Godbreathed”? The phrase “inspired by God” (<a class="verse" verse="2 Tim 3:16">2 Tim. 3:16</a>, NASB) is translated from the Greek theopneustos. We can look back to Adam for a clue. Adam, the first man, was “God breathed,” meaning that God literally breathed life into him. Thus, Adam’s life was God inspired; it is the reason he became a living soul. That’s why the Bible is called the Living Word of God. It has power to convict, correct, and instruct us in how to grow into the fullness of God.

<a class="verse" verse="2 Peter 1:19–21">2 Peter 1:19–21</a> defines the gift of prophecy. It is the act of speaking authoritatively for God, either by foretelling future events or declaring God’s will. Foretelling is not essential to the nature of a prophet; neither are all prophetic utterances considered predictions. Some utterances may be warnings or counsel given to the prophets, inspired by the Holy Spirit. A prophet may speak of the past, present, or future.

**REACT**

`1. Like the prophecies of the past, is it possible for us now to get prophecies from God of what’s going to happen in the latter days?`
`2. We believe that Ellen White’s writings are gifts of prophecy from God for us. How can we practically introduce this to others who do not have the same belief as we do?`
