**What the lessons are about**

These lessons are about God’s kingdom of grace and being a recruited agent (steward, citizen) of that kingdom. There is a battle going on between God’s kingdom and the kingdom of evil. Being agents of God’s kingdom requires action. We can’t just listen to what Jesus asks of us—we are to do it (James 1:22) if we want to be effective agents of the kingdom on this earth.

The first lesson of each quarter covers a different section of Jesus’ sermon on the mount, which is “at once Christ’s inaugural address as king of the kingdom of grace and also the constitution of the kingdom” (The Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 322).

After the first lesson of each quarter the rest of the lessons are about the different challenges, rights, or privileges in the “real time” of being an agent of God’s kingdom. A Christian never knows what he or she will be encountering next.

**How to use this bible study guide**

**Step 1**: Notice that this Bible study guide isn’t meant to be read like a usual magazine or book. Each lesson comes out of the binding to be used as a separate sheet for study in advance during the week in preparation for Sabbath School. Be sure to take the right lesson to Sabbath School with you each week.

**Step 2**: Use each week’s lesson in the way that is best for you. Each section has a day of the week listed beside it, but you may want to mix and match sections as you study. The sections work in any order.

**Step 3**: Review the memory verse each day of the week.

**Step 4**: Be prepared to share your thoughts and discoveries with your Sabbath School class.
