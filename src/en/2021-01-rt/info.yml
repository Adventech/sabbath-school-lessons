  title: "IM: Individual Messaging"
  description: "These lessons are about God’s kingdom of grace and being a recruited agent (steward, citizen) of that kingdom. There is a battle going on between God’s kingdom and the kingdom of evil. Being agents of God’s kingdom requires action. We can’t just listen to what Jesus asks of us—we are to do it (James 1:22) if we want to be effective agents of the kingdom on this earth. The first lesson of each quarter covers a different section of Jesus’ sermon on the mount, which is “at once Christ’s inaugural address as king of the kingdom of grace and also the constitution of the kingdom” (The Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 322). After the first lesson of each quarter the rest of the lessons are about the different challenges, rights, or privileges in the “real time” of being an agent of God’s kingdom. A Christian never knows what he or she will be encountering next. Remember to go to http://guidemagazine.org/rtf and explore each week’s topic with other e-teens. Find out how other young people are facing the challenge of living for God in the real world."
