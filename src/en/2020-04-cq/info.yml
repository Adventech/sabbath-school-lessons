  description: "Historically, education and theology have consistently been connected. The University of Bologna, believed to have been founded in 1088, has traditionally been considered the oldest continuously operating university in the world. Some attribute the rapid growth of the university to its purpose of training clergy in public speaking and the fulfillment of other ecclesiastical duties. From the outset, the university stressed the importance of law, theology, medicine, and philosophy in its assistance to the church."
