### The Anger of Elihu

### READ FOR THIS WEEK’S LESSON:
Job 13:28; Job 28:28; Job 32:1–5; Job 34:10–15; Ezekiel 28:12–17; Job 1–2:10.

> <p>MEMORY VERSE:</p>
> “ ‘The heavens are higher than the earth. And my ways are higher than your ways. My thoughts are higher than your thoughts’ ” (Isaiah 55:9, NIrV).

IN THE BATTLE BETWEEN JOB AND these three men, there are words that sometimes are wise, beautiful, deep, and true. How often people will quote from the book of Job. They even quote from Eliphaz, Bildad, or Zophar. And that is because, as we have seen again and again, they do have a lot of good things to say. They just do not say them in the right place, at the right time, in the right situation. Their use of words should teach us the powerful truth of these verses in Proverbs 25:11–13:

The right word at the right time\
is like golden apples in silver jewelry.\
A wise person’s warning to a listening ear\
is like a gold earring or jewelry made of  ne gold.\
A messenger trusted by those who send him is like cool snow at harvest time.\
He renews the spirit of his masters (NIrV).

Sadly, those were not the words that Job was hearing from his friends. In fact, the problem was going to get worse because, instead of just three people telling him he was wrong, a fourth person came on the scene.
