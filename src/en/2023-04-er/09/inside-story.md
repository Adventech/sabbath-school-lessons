### The Road To Spain: Part 3

God worked a miracle in Pastor Luis Paiva’s life. God gave Luis $1,000 dollars to pay off a loan. This miracle helped Luis believe that God wanted him and his family to leave Venezuela. But they didn’t have any savings.

Luis prayed, “Lord, how do I leave with no savings?”

Luis’s wife told him that a pastor in the United States called to talk with him. The pastor needed a volunteer to work for a year in a part of Mexico that didn’t have a Seventh-day Adventist church. So, Luis went to Mexico. His wife and children joined him two months later. Over the next eight months, 35 people were baptized because of Luis’ hard work. One new member gave the Adventist group a building. The building became the new church for the group.

But the government refused to give Luis a visa to allow him to stay in Mexico. A visa is a special passport. Luis didn’t know what to do. He didn’t want to move to the United States without a visa or to stay in Mexico without a visa. Luis made friends with someone who worked in the government’s visa office. When the government worker heard about Luis’s problem, he promised not to send Luis back to Venezuela. Luis believed his friend. At the same time, Luis trusted God more than any human. God said, “Don’t depend on your leaders for help. Don’t depend on people, because they cannot save you” (Psalm 146:3, ERV).

Worried, Luis prayed. He also made phone calls to churches in the United States and Canada and asked for legal advice about leaving Mexico. Only two churches in Canada answered Luis. Luis continued to stay in Mexico. Then a church member visited Luis’s home. He asked Luis, “What is your biggest fear?”

Luis said, “I don’t want to live in Mexico without a visa, and I don’t want to travel without a visa to the United States. I also don’t want to go back to my country.”

The man asked, “If you had the money, what would you do right now?”

Luis answered, “I’d buy a plane ticket to fly to Spain.” Luis had an aunt who went to Spain 20 years earlier. If he moved there, he’d be near her. Also, Luis visited Spain three years earlier and liked the country very much.

The church member said, “So, let’s buy the tickets so you and your family can fly to Spain.”

The man bought the plane tickets and told Luis not to worry. He said, “God is leading you.”

Today, Luis and his wife work for God in Spain.
