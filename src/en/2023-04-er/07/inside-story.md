### The Road To Spain: Part 1

Luis got sick shortly after he was baptized. At that time, Luis started studying to be a pastor at the Venezuelan Adventist University.

At first, Luis thought he had the flu. But then he got worse. He had trouble breathing. Doctors thought that the pollen, or yellow powder, on the orange blossoms around the university made Luis sick. Luis got many shots to help him breathe more easily. But his lungs continued to give him trouble. Luis’s doctors told him to quit his studies and go home to get well. But Luis didn’t want to leave school. He continued to get more medical tests to figure out his problem.

Then a medical test showed that Luis had HIV. HIV can cause AIDS, a terrible disease that can cause much suffering and death. At that time, people in Venezuela were very afraid of HIV. Many people thought they could get HIV if they touched someone who had it. Luis was asked to leave school.

Luis had no choice but to go home. At home, he had more medical tests. The tests always showed the same thing: he had HIV. Luis didn’t understand why this was happening to him when he was trying so hard to follow God. Wasn’t he also studying to become a pastor? His felt very sad.

A church leader saw that Luis looked very sad. The church leader told him, “You should be joyful. If you aren’t joyful, then you haven’t really met Jesus.”

The church leader’s words cut Luis deep in his heart. Luis went home and knelt down on his bedroom floor. He prayed, ‘I don’t want You to heal me. I just want to preach for the rest of the days that You give me to live.”

In that instant, something strange happened. Luis felt as if fire filled his heart. The heat spread over his whole body. Then Luis fainted.

Later, when Luis got another medical test, the test showed that he no longer had HIV. Luis was surprised. He asked to take another test, and another test after that. Always he was HIV-free. The doctor said, “Why do you keep asking for more tests? You don’t need to take any more tests. You’re healed.”

Luis kept his promise to God. Luis became a preacher and helped many people to accept Jesus. Luis got married and finished his studies at the university in 2006.

Luis says, “I haven’t stopped preaching the Good News about Jesus since He healed me.”

Today, Luis and his family are workers for God in Spain.
