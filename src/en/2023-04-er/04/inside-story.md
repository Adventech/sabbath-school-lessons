### A Little Church With A Big Heart For God

Seventh-day Adventist church leaders decided it was time to sell a little church on an island in northern Germany. Only six people worshiped there: all members were older people. The church opened in 1940. In the 1950s, the church had 33 members. The head leader of the Rügen church was named Gunthardt. He told church leaders in Germany, “We don’t want to sell our church.”

After East and West Germany joined as one country in 1990, the little church on Rügen Island lost more members. Some members died. Young ones moved away. Also, the people who lived on the island weren’t very religious. The church’s only visitors were people who came to the island on vacation. Gunthardt and his wife joined with the other four church members. Two of these members included Gunthardt’s parents. Together, they prayed, “Lord, bring us new members.”

Then an Adventist doctor and his family moved to the island. The members kept praying. Then a member who stopped coming to church for a while started to come again, and several new people joined. Soon 16 people started worshiping at the little church on Rügen Island. The church leaders in Germany decided to keep the church open. Soon, the church members needed a new church building. Members prayed and gave 136,000 euros (that’s 136,000 U.S. dollars). They needed 730,000 euros total. The people kept praying for God to help them get the money they needed.

Gunthardt was a builder. He drew a plan for a new church building. Church members all over Germany gave money to help pay for it. Soon after, Gunthardt met a government leader at a meeting and told him about the new church building plan. The leader told Gundthardt to contact a local community leader for help. Before Gundthardt met with this leader, church members prayed. The local leader offered Gundthardt 300,000 euros. The leader said, “I am a Christian. Please use the new church building to help people learn Bible truth.”

Today, 25 members and their children worship every Sabbath at the church on Rügen Island. Gundthardt says, “We have a new church building, and we owe no money. God showed us that He wanted our church to stay open.”

The Rügen church waits for more miracles. Their work for God shows us Church Growth Task #2 of the Seventh-day Adventist Church’s “I Will Go” plan. Church Growth Task #2 is: “We will help the Adventist church grow strong in new ways in large cities. We will share Jesus with people who do not know Him.” Read more: IWillGo2020.org. Gundthardt says, “The people on our island are not religious. We are trying to connect with them.”
