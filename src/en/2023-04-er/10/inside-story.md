### The Road To Spain, Part 4

When Luis Paiva moved to Spain, he needed to earn a living to support his family. So, he decided to sell fruit to make some money. Luis knew in his heart that God wanted him to work for Him elsewhere. Luis also worried that his new business might get in the way of his working fully for God. Two weeks later, Luis’s life fell apart. His business started to fail. His partners cheated him. He got sick and couldn’t walk. But Luis didn’t want to give up. He asked some Seventh-day Adventists for business advice. One of the men knew that Luis trained to be a pastor and scolded him. The man said, “You shouldn’t be selling fruit when God chose you to preach the Good News!” These words cut Luis’s heart as if God Himself said them. Luis felt so hopeless. How could he serve as a pastor when he didn’t have a church? Luis talked about the problem with his wife. In the end, they decided to go back to Venezuela. Maybe Luis could get better there.

A short time later, Luis got a phone call from a man named Gabriel Diaz. Gabriel was a leader of the Adventist Church in Spain. The church needed a worker to go to Lugo, a city in the northwest part of Spain. Luis was excited about working as a pastor again. At the same time, he told Gabriel that he had terrible health problems. He said, “I can’t walk.”

Gabriel didn’t lose hope. The two men prayed together. Two weeks later, Luis started to walk again. Then he went to Lugo and started a house church. The first Sabbath, only two people showed up. In less than four months, 22 people started coming to the house church every Sabbath. Three of these people were new members who had been baptized. Other people started studying to get ready for baptism. Also, Luis started a Bible study school and another school to teach members how to lead other people to Jesus. Luis also wants to move his church members from the house church to their own church building.

Luis says, “We must win more hearts for Jesus so that we can open our own church. I trust God. I believe He will make this plan happen because we are following His example.”

Ellen White wrote, “Only Jesus’ plan will give you real success in leading people to Him. The Savior spent time with people. He showed them that He wanted the best for them. Jesus showed people He understood their suffering. Jesus gave them the things they needed. He won their trust. Then He told them, ‘Follow Me.’ ”—The Ministry of Healing, page 143, adapted.

Luis never expected to serve God in Spain. Now he is so happy. He says, “I’m here because of God’s mercy.”
