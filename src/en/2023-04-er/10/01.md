> <p>Memory verse</p>
> “He is the God who made the whole world [the earth] and everything in it. He is the Lord of the land and the sky. He does not live in temples that men build!” (Acts 17:24, ICB).

Luke tells us about Paul’s work in Athens, Greece. Luke writes, “So he [Paul] went to the synagogue [Jewish place of worship]. There he talked both with Jews and with Greeks who worshiped God. Each day he spoke with anyone who happened to be in the market place” (Acts 17:17, NIrV).

Paul refused to help only his own people, the Jews. God sent Paul to help save other people, too.

Paul also refused to work only with non-Jews who accepted God. They already knew some Bible truth, even if they didn’t know Jesus. Their faith and knowledge about God made Paul’s work easy.

While Paul was in Athens, he tried to preach about Jesus to the people. Many famous philosophers lived in Athens. Philosophers were people who studied about the meaning of life. Paul wanted to share Jesus with the people in Athens. The beliefs and history of the people in Athens were different from Jewish beliefs and history.

How did Paul try to share Jesus with these people? What can we learn from his story?
