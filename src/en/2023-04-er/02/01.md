### Read for this week’s lesson

> <p>Memory verse</p>
> “So go and make followers of all people in the world [on the earth]. Baptize them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit” (Matthew 28:19, ERV).

God works to save us. We see this idea all through the Bible. God’s work to save us is the same as a thread that connects the stories of our human history together. Also, God’s work to save us helps us to understand another part of His saving plan. God wants to make our lives new (read Colossians 3:9, 10; 1 John 3:2).

God’s work to save us also helps us understand God’s Word, the Bible. When we read the Bible, we understand that God wants to touch our lives. God wants to be close to us in our hearts. Yes, sin separates us from God (Isaiah 59:2). But God continues to fix the broken relationship with His children. God will keep doing this work until He makes everything new (Revelation 21:5).

Meanwhile, God chose to show Himself to us in a special way to help us understand His love and His plan to save us. God showed us who He is so that we can have a real relationship with Him. Then we can come to know and love Him. We also can share with other people our experience with God and His saving love. In the Bible, God gives us a picture that shows us what His saving plan is all about.
