### Two Boys, Two Prayers — Part 2

Eight months passed after God gave Father an amazing answer to prayer. Then Seventh-day Adventist church members visited Father a second time on a Sabbath at his home in Conakry, Guinea. Guinea is a country in West Africa. 15 people arrived with Father’s sons, Junior and Emile. The boys were students at the Adventist school that was next to the Adventist church.

A church leader said to Father, “We want to pray with you.”

Father was thankful, but first he had a question. “All other Christians go to church on Sunday. But you worship on Saturday. Why?”

The church leader invited Father to open his Bible to Exodus 20:8–10. Father read, “ ‘Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor [work] and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Loordrd your God’ ” (NKJV). But father wasn’t convinced. He said, “The 7th day is Sunday.” Father said this because the calendar in some countries was changed so that Monday is now the 1st day of the week.

The leader asked Father to turn to Matthew 28:1. Father read, “ ‘The day after the Sabbath day was the first day of the week. That day at dawn Mary Magdalene and the other woman named Mary went to look at the tomb’ ” (ERV). Father saw the 7th day of the Bible was Saturday. After the church group left, he showed the Sabbath verses to Mother. “I don’t care what the Adventists say. I won’t leave my church.”

Father said that they should pray and fast. When people fast, they don’t eat food for a short time. Father said, “We started having questions about the Sabbath after our boys started to go the Adventist school. We sent our kids there to learn. But maybe God sent our kids to that church to lead us there. If this is Jesus’ church, let Jesus show us.”

The next Sabbath, Mother agreed to go the Adventist church. The church members welcomed Mother and Father with smiles. Father was so happy. He felt God lift a heavy load off his back. Father hadn’t prayed a lot in the past. Now he prayed every day.

As Father prayed, God changed his life. God gave Father success in his job. Father started to get along with family. Soon Father and Mother were baptized. Father says, “I have peace.” Father’s name is Pepe Voctorien Soropogui (see picture). His wife’ name is Tido Grace Haba. Father says, “I know Jesus is with this church. I thank God for bringing me here.”

Thank you for your 13th Sabbath Offering three years ago that helped the Adventist Maranatha School in the middle of West Africa. Your 13th Sabbath Offering this quarter will again help workers in the middle of West Africa share the Good News.
