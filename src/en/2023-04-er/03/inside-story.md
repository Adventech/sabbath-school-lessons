### A Special Story

Gina Wahlen was excited to visit a house church. The church was in a country where Christians were often hurt or punished for their faith in God. Gina went to the house church to collect stories for the Mission quarterly.

The house church was in an apartment building. One of the apartments on the ground floor had been turned into a church. Gina started to talk to people from the church. Gina didn’t know the language of the people, so someone translated Gina’s words to the people in their own language.

The people were very nice. But they didn’t have any special stories. As time passed, Gina grew worried. This church was the only place in this country where Gina planned to go to collect stories. She prayed, “Dear Lord, please help me find someone who has a wonderful story about You. I don’t know how to find anyone because I don’t speak the language. So, Lord, will you please send me someone with a special story?”

Soon after, a woman in her 30s came into the room. The woman sang in the church choir and was putting away her choir clothes. Gina asked the person who helped her to translate a question to the woman: “Have you been coming to this church for long?”

No, the woman had been coming only a few months.

Gina asked how the woman learned about Seventh-day Adventists.

The woman said that she walked to the market with her two young children on a Saturday. Two men walked up to her. One of the men said, “The 7th day is the Sabbath.” Then the other man told her, “You can learn more about the Sabbath on the Internet.” Then the men kept walking.

The woman went home and searched online. She found sermons from an Adventist pastor that were translated into her language. She watched many of the programs and felt blessed.

Then she found the house church. She came to church, ready to be baptized. She was baptized shortly before Gina came. Gina was so excited. “I was amazed when I heard this woman’s story. I was so happy that God answered my prayer in this beautiful way.”

Gina Wahlen served as Mission quarterlies editor at Adventist Mission for three years. Now she works as editor and special planning manager for the Office of the General Conference President.
