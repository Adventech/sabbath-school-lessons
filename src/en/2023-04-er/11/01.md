### Read for this week’s lesson
Judges 3:1–6; Matthew 9:35–38; Matthew 15:22–28; Acts 10:9–16, 28, 34, 35; Matthew 8:10, 13.

> <p>Memory verse</p>
> “Then Jesus answered, ‘Woman, you have great [much] faith! I will do what you asked me to do.’ And at that moment the woman’s daughter was healed” (Matthew 15:28, ICB).

From the start, a loving God went looking for His lost children (Genesis 3:9). Today, this same loving God continues to save lost people (read Revelation 14:6–12), including the lost who live in cities. In 2018, a report from the United Nations said that 55% of people on this earth live in cities. This number will grow to 68% (if Jesus doesn’t come) by 2050. We have no choice: we must share the Good News about Jesus with people in the cities.

Many of God’s people act the same as Jonah when God asks them to do His work in a city. They run away from the task. “Everything written in the past was written to teach us. The Scriptures [the Old and New Testaments] give us strength to go on. They encourage us and give us hope” (Romans 15:4, NIrV). We must learn from Jonah’s story, so we don’t make his same mistakes.

When Jesus lived on this earth, He helped people in the cities of Israel and also in foreign lands.

This week, we will study the story about Jesus’ work for the people in the cities of Tyre and Sidon. What can we learn from Jesus’ work that can help us in our work today?
