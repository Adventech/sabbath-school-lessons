### Dreaming Dreams—Part 1

16-year-old Joseph Delamou was worried. He worried that he didn’t belong to Jesus’ true church. Joseph lived in Conakry, the capital city of the country of Guinea in West Africa. He prayed, “Show me the way, Lord. I’ll go wherever You lead.”

That night, Joseph had a dream. He dreamed that he and 70 members of his church were at a meeting. Joseph and his church members talked about ways to add more members to their church. Outside the building where they met, Joseph saw a castle that belonged to a mighty king. This king bragged that he controlled the whole earth. All of a sudden, a group of soldiers burst into the meeting. One of the soldiers told Joseph, “You need to leave and come with us. We want you to join our army.”

Joseph didn’t want to leave, but the soldier said he must. The soldier told Joseph, “Leave. You can’t stay here. Go anywhere you want. Just don’t stay here. After three days, you can come back and see what has happened to the people here.”

Joseph left. Three days later, he came back. The building was empty. Joseph wondered where everyone was. Then he saw a boy hiding behind the wall of the king’s castle. The boy bled. When Joseph tried to talk to him, the boy put a finger to his lips to tell him to be quiet. The boy whispered, “Come here.”

Joseph came near. The boy said, “Your God is powerful!”

Joseph said, “What?”	The boy answered, “I said, ‘Your God is powerful!” How come you are the only person who left us three days ago? Many of us were shot and killed. You are the only one who escaped. How?”

The boy led Joseph to a pile of dirt. The boy said the dirt was the grave of more than 40 people. He told Joseph, “The soldiers didn’t train anyone. They shot and killed people. Then they put the ones who didn’t die in cages and took them away.”

Joseph saw a snake lying still on the ground. The boy said the snake was the king who used to live in the castle. The boy said, “Come see the prince who is now in control.”

Joseph couldn’t take his eyes off the dead snake. “How did a snake make itself king of the whole earth? I don’t understand how people accepted a snake as their king.”

The boy said, “I can’t explain this to you right now.”

Then, Joseph woke up. He didn’t understand everything in his dream. He knew the dream was a sign that God wanted him to leave his father’s church. Where should he go?

Your 13th Sabbath Offering on December 30 will help church workers share the Good News about Jesus in West Africa, which includes Guinea. Thank you for planning to give a big offering. Read more about Joseph next week.
