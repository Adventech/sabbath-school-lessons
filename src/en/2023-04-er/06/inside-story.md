### The Blessing That Is Ours When We Give

A woman in the U.S. state of North Carolina invited her two church pastors to her house. She wanted to talk to them about a special offering named the Yearly Sacrifice Offering. A sacrifice offering is money you save so that you can give it to God to help support His work. The woman told the pastors that the Seventh-day Adventist Church started the Yearly Sacrifice Offering in 1922 to help support church workers overseas who didn’t have enough money to finish their work. The woman said that people gave sacrifice offerings to help the workers at the time. Today, the sacrifice offering continues to support church workers all over the earth.

The pastors decided to start collecting the Yearly Sacrifice Offering. One pastor preached nine sermons on giving gifts of money to support God’s work. The pastor preached his nine sermons before the church collected the Yearly Sacrifice Offering. What happened after that? The 700-member church in Hendersonville, North Carolina, collected $24,119.00 that year for the Yearly Sacrifice Offering, in 2016. (The year before that, in 2015, the church collected only $1,400.00.) During the COVID-19 lockdowns in 2021, the church gave a surprising $37,545.00 to the Yearly Sacrifice Offering.

Pastor David Wright (see picture) said, “We were so surprised and happy. Praise the Lord!”

Pastor Wright gave God and His mercy all the glory for what happened. “This offering will help church workers bring Bible truth to areas where people don’t know God. We are so blessed as a church family to be part of this work. As Paul wrote, ‘We must remember what the Lord Jesus said, “We are more happy when we give than when we receive [get]” ’ ” (Acts 20:35, NLV).

Adventist Mission manager Gary Krause agrees. Krause shares this quote from Ellen G. White, who writes, “The success of the work in our local churches depends a lot on the work we do for God in countries far away.”—Testimonies to the Church, volume 6, page 27, adapted. David Trim, an expert in research for the church, gives proof that Ellen White’s words are correct.

Having a giving spirit is part of who we are as Adventists. Ted N. C. Wilson, the President of the General Conference says, “The people who started our church had giving spirits. They gave things up to help support God’s work. We will finish God’s work with the same spirit of giving. Each of us has a special part to help support God’s work with the money God gives us.”
