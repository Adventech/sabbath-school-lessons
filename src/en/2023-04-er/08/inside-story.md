### The Road To Spain: Part 2

Only five families were in their homes when gunmen robbed the group of nine houses where Seventh-day Adventist pastors and their families lived. The robbers forced the five families into one of the houses. Then the robbers separated the men, women, and children. Police arrived and spread out around the house. At last, the trouble ended 10 hours later at 3 a.m. when one of the gunmen ran into the forest behind the house. The wives and children of the nine pastors moved away after the 2016 robbery. The pastors worked alone for several months while they waited for new jobs. Several pastors moved to other countries to serve as pastors there.

Luis Paiva had worked as a pastor for about ten years. He wasn’t sure what to do now. Life was hard in Venezuela. He and his family didn’t have much money. Food was hard to get. For three years, Luis tried hard to pay off a loan. But he couldn’t pay the interest he owed. Interest is the money you pay the bank each month to borrow money. Now Luis owed the bank $1,000.

The robbery upset Luis’s wife so much. She and their three children weren’t at home when the robbers attacked. But she didn’t want to live in Venezuela anymore. Luis agreed that the country wasn’t safe. But he wanted to pay his loan first before they moved to another country.

Luis asked God for a sign to show him what to do. Luis didn’t often ask for signs. He believed God could lead His people without them. But Luis didn’t know what else to do. So, he prayed, “Lord, please work a miracle to help me pay this loan. I will know the gift of money is a sign to leave here.”

The gunmen stole things from all nine houses, including Luis’ house. Luis’ home had been robbed many times over the past year. But Luis hadn’t reported his losses to the insurance company. That’s because the things that the robbers took were not worth very much. But now church leaders offered to pay for everything that was stolen during the past year if Luis got proof from the police that said he was robbed. None of the other nine pastors got the report. But Luis had friends who were policemen. They helped him get the report.

Two months later, the insurance company gave Luis $1,000 dollars. That was the exact amount Luis needed to pay his loan.

Today, Luis works for God in Spain. He says, “I didn’t spend the insurance money on myself or my family. I understood that God sent the money so I could pay off the loan. I knew that God also blessed my plan to leave the country.”
