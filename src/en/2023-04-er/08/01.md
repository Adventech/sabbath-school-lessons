Luke 5:17–26 shows us how God helps people who are in need. Sometimes God uses other people to help us. Or He uses us to help other people. Helping people may be hard work at times. But God rewards us for our efforts. When we help people in need, we show them the work that Jesus did. Sometimes we know who needs our help. Other times, we don’t know who to help. God asks us to be His helpers. He wants us to help everyone in need, whoever they are.

The Bible encourages us to be nice to strangers and to make new friends. When people trust us, we can learn better ways of helping them find Jesus.

The topic for this week’s lesson is “Helping People in Need.” This topic shows us that God has a plan for people in need. God’s plan shows us the many ways we can help people in need. These people may need help with their budget or health. Or maybe they feel lonely or are suffering. Maybe their family or their community no longer accepts them. Whatever their needs, we must be ready to do what we can to help. When we help other people, we show everyone an important part of God’s work. We also show them what it means to be a Christian.
