### Dreaming Dreams—Part 3

Joseph Delamou didn’t know which church he should go to in Conakry where he lived. Conakry is the capital city of the country of Guinea in West Africa. After Joseph studied the Bible with his English teacher, he learned things that showed him his church wasn’t following the Bible. So, Joseph asked God to show Him the Lord’s church.

Then Joseph had a dream. In this dream, Joseph was locked in a prison. One of his family members was a prison guard. Joseph asked him for freedom. The family member said, “Yes, we come from the same family. But I can’t free you.”

Joseph tried to escape. But his family member caught him.

The family member scolded Joseph, “If you try that again, I will punish you in a way you will always remember!”

Joseph heard someone in the prison announce the punishment he would suffer if he tried to run away again: “Someone will bring straw into the prison. They will put the straw under you and set the straw on fire.”

Joseph understood that the punishment was a word picture for hell after Jesus’ Second Coming. Joseph prayed, “Lord, I’m not better than the other people in this jail. Please don’t let me die here. I want to do something wonderful for You with my life before I die.”

After Joseph prayed, some guard took him to meet with three soldiers. One soldier said, “Joseph, you must pay the price for your freedom.”

Joseph answered, “God made me free, not you. Jesus paid the price for my sins on the cross. I owe you nothing.”

The soldier frowned. “If you don’t pay, we will put you back in prison.”

Joseph said, “My freedom didn’t come from you. You can’t go against God, who made me free. My life depends on God. If you hurt me, you hurt God.”

The soldiers left the room. Joseph turned around and saw his English teacher, Fortunate. Fortunate said, “Your freedom is from God.”

Then Joseph woke up, sweating. It was 3 a.m. The dream felt so real. He prayed, “Thank you, God. Every time I ask for help, You answer me. I thank You for your answers and Your love.”

Today, Joseph is 24 and a loyal Seventh-day Adventist.

Joseph says, “When I was a child, I asked God to lead me. God answered this prayer when He led me to the Adventist Church. I’m ready to serve God.”
