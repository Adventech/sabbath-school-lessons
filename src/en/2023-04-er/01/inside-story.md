### Two Boys, Two Prayers — Part 1

Father was excited when he saw a sign in front of a new school. The sign said Adventist Maranatha School. The school was located in Conakry. Conakry is the capital of Guinea, a country in West Africa. Father decided to visit the school. He wanted his two sons to get a Christian education. Father had no idea this school would change his life.

Father went inside and found a teacher. Father asked the woman, “Is this a Christian school?”

The woman said, “Yes. This is a Seventh-day Adventist school.”

Father told the teacher, “I want my sons to go to a Christian school.”

Soon, the two boys were students at the school. The boys were named Junior and Emile. Junior was 11, and Emile was 8. The boys studied the Bible at their new school and learned Bible verses that Father never heard before. Father was surprised when his boys told him that the teachers worshiped God on Saturdays. The boys asked Father if they could go to Saturday meetings at the church next to the school. Father thought the meetings were afterschool classes, so he agreed.

The boys went to church every Sabbath for two years. Sometimes, schoolteachers visited Father and invited him to come to church. The teachers asked Father, “Will you come to our church on Sabbath?” Father always refused. He said, “No, I’m busy. I must work on Saturday.”

Not long after, the church pastor, Matthew, told his church members, “Today, we will visit the father of Junior and Emile.” A group of 15 church members went with Junior and Emile to their home. Junior and Emile were so happy. The pastor asked Father, “May we pray with you?”

Father agreed. The pastor asked Father if he had any special needs. Father did. He worked for a company that helped make people’s lives better. Months earlier, Father asked the government of Guinea for a gift of money to do special work in the community. Father had not gotten an answer from the government. So, the pastor prayed about the gift of money. Soon after, the government answered the pastor’s prayer. The government agreed to give Father’s company the money. Father went to the school and told the teachers about the answer to prayer. Father thanked God for the gift. But he wasn’t ready to go to church.

Thank you for your 13th Sabbath Offering three years ago that helped the Adventist Maranatha School in the middle of West Africa. Your 13th Sabbath Offering this quarter will again help church workers in the middle of West Africa share the Good News. Read the rest of Father’s story next week.
