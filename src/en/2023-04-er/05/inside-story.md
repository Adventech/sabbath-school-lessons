### A Hope Stronger Than Fear

As a girl, Grete suffered from panic sickness. She often woke up at night and felt afraid. Her heart pumped very fast. Grete’s fear was so strong that she wondered if her heart would burst. She didn’t know where to go to get help. Life scared her. Going to school and walking on the street scared her, too. She didn’t think anyone in Germany, where she lived, could help her.

When she couldn’t sleep, Grete often thought about her friend Annika. The two girls grew up together and sang in the children’s choir. Then Annika got sick with cancer. Annika was brave. She put her trust in God. She told her parents, “Don’t be afraid. I know God loves me. Everything will be fine.” Annika died without pain or fear.

Annika’s faith surprised Grete. Grete was scared every night. Annika’s words were the first time that Grete heard about a loving God and everlasting life. Grete wondered if heaven was a real place. “How can I get there?” Grete thought.

Grete stopped suffering panic at night when she was 14. But she continued to feel afraid and lonely. Then she met her future husband, Nico. Nico didn’t go to church every week. But he had strong faith in God. Nico’s parents were Seventh-day Adventists. They welcomed Grete to their home for the Christmas holiday. They were the most loving family Grete ever spent time with. During that holiday, Grete’s heart was filled with so much surprise and happiness that she ran upstairs to cry.

Grete felt God’s love in that home. She knew then that God could help her to stop feeling afraid. Grete saw that God is powerful. He can save anyone. Grete felt safe for the first time. She wanted to feel safe forever.

Grete started Bible studies. Later, she and Nico joined the Seventh-day Adventist church on Germany’s Rügen Island. Nico and Grete didn’t know it at the time, but the church almost shut down because it didn’t have enough members. Nico and Grete were an answer to the prayers of the church members. One of those members was Nico’s father, Gunthardt, who was the head church leader. Today, Nico and Grete are happy members of the growing church on Rügen Island. Not long ago, the church built a larger building for all its new members.

Grete says, “The most wonderful thing in my life is that I got to know Jesus. I know that knowing Him is the best thing I ever did in my life. My life is so happy.”

Thank you for your Sabbath School offerings that help church workers share the Good News about Jesus with people in Germany and in other countries all over the earth where people aren’t very religious.
