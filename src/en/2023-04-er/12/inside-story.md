### DREAMING DREAMS: PART 2

Joseph Delamou went to church every day since he was a small boy. Joseph knelt in worship in front of statues because that’s what his father did. Then Joseph had a strange dream after he asked God if he was going to the correct church. Joseph believed the dream was an answer to his prayer. God was asking him to leave his father’s church. So, 16-year-old Joseph joined another church in Conakry. Conakry is the capital city of the country of Guinea in West Africa. People speak the French language in Guinea. Soon, Joseph became the youth leader at his new church. He helped the young people share Jesus with folks in the community. Several years passed. Joseph’s father grew upset with his son for going to a new church. Father said, “Joseph, I want you to learn English. You need to stop working for your church and start studying English.”

Joseph wanted to keep going to church. But to make Father happy, Joseph quit his church work. Then he started studying English. He was 23 years old. The English teacher was named Fortunate Kaloubilori. Fortunate started each class with prayer. Joseph was surprised. He thought he was giving up God to learn English. But his teacher prayed to God before he taught every lesson. Three weeks later, the teacher asked Joseph for help. Fortunate said, “I have many papers to grade. Please, can you stay and help me?”

When Fortunate and Joseph finished grading papers, Fortunate invited Joseph to study the Bible with him. Joseph was pleased. He thought, “God follows me everywhere!”

Joseph learned new Bible teachings that showed him that both his new church and his father’s church weren’t following Bible truth. The new Bible teachings showed Joseph that Fortunate’s church followed the Bible. Fortunate was a Seventh-day Adventist. The Bible study left Joseph confused about what he should do. Joseph blamed his father and said to himself, “I only have these problems because my father sent me to learn English.”

Joseph continued Bible studies for two months. Then he went to his pastor for advice. Joseph wanted to know which church was the correct church. The pastor said the Adventists were wrong. “Don’t pay attention to them.”

Joseph decided to pray for three days about what to do. Then he had another dream.

Your 13th Sabbath Offering on December 30 will help church workers share the Good News about Jesus in West Africa, which includes Guinea. Thank you for planning to give a big offering. Read more about Joseph and Fortunate next week.
