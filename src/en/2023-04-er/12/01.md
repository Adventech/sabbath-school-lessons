> <p>Memory verse</p>
> “Here is what the Lord says to me. ‘It is not enough for you as my servant to bring the tribes [family groups] of Jacob back to their land. It is not enough for you to bring back the people of Israel I have kept alive. I will also make you [the same as] a light for the Gentiles. Then you will make it possible for the whole world [the people on earth] to be saved’ ” (Isaiah 49:6, NIrV).

ESTHER AND HER UNCLE MORDECAI were Jews who lived in Susa. Susa was the capital city of the Kingdom of Persia. Many Jews had gone back to live in the land of Judah. But Esther and her uncle, along with other Jews, stayed in Persia.

Then Esther became queen of all Persia. “The king loved Esther more than any of the other young women, and she became his favorite. He approved of [liked] her more than any of the others [young women]. So King Xerxes put a crown on Esther’s head and made her the new queen in place of Vashti” (Esther 2:17, ERV).

As Queen of Persia, Esther had an important part in Bible history. Her story shows how God’s people can share His truth in foreign lands.

Take time to read the book of Esther for this week’s study.
