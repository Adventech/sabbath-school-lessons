  title: "Helping God Save People"
  description: "Years ago, one of our Adventist magazines printed a picture story about a stinky swamp. A walking path went through the middle of the swamp. People who walked on the path complained about the terrible smell. Sometimes the smell was so awful that people on the path fainted and fell in. Villagers who lived near the swamp heard the cries of the people as they fell in and died."
