### A Letter to Parents

**Dear Friends,**

In each issue of the Beginner Bible Study Guide you will find only three lessons— one for each month of the quarter. This gives your child a better opportunity to learn concepts emphasized throughout the month and to offer more repetition. Children at this age learn best through repetition.

The three lessons in this Bible study guide focus on serving God by caring for others; God bringing His love to us; and the birth of Jesus. Activities in the Do & Say section at the end of each lesson teach and reinforce these three important concepts.

Now is the time to help your child start to learn about God’s Word, the Bible. Show your child the memory verses in your Bible. Then use the motions to help reinforce the text. Be an example. Let him or her see you reading God’s Word every day.

As you share these lessons with your child, take time to pray a short prayer, sing a happy song, read with enthusiasm, and have fun with the Do & Say activities as part of your family worship. Involve your young child in worship now, and you will foster a love for Jesus and His Word that will last.

Make the time—take the time—to worship with your child every day. Years from now you’ll be glad you did.

Cordially, The Editors
