### Dear parents,

In this issue of the Kindergarten Bible Study Guide you will find that the lessons are from the life of Jesus. In these lessons the children will be introduced to three major themes—service through following Jesus’ example; experiencing God’s grace by being part of His family; and worshipping by praising Jesus for what He has done for us.

We believe that kindergarten children are able to understand God’s messages in Scripture, so we urge you to sit with your child each day to share the lesson. As part of your family worship, pray for understanding from the Holy Spirit; sing a happy song; read with enthusiasm; and have fun with the Do and Say activities. Use the motions to review the memory verse. This will help your child remember it.

Let your child tell you the story from the pictures or help to read the lesson if he or she is able. Read the story from the Bible at some time during the week. A number of simplified children’s versions are available today. Teach by example and word that the Bible is precious and holy.

Take the time—make the time—to involve your young child in worship every day, and you will foster a love for Jesus and His Word that will last. Years from now, you’ll be glad you did.

Our prayer is that these lessons will bring joy and peace to you and your child. Let us pray for one another as we work together to lead little ones to Jesus.
