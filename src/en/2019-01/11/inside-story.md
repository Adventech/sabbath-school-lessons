#### Moses and Zimbabwe’s Police

_By Andrew McChesney, Adventist Mission_

The 26-year-old missionary gazed at the group of 50 Zimbabwean police officers. The uniformed men and women had just participated in a colorful parade in downtown Bulawayo, and they were waiting for him to speak.

Emmanuel Msimanga—a Global Mission pioneer assigned to the central business district of Zimbabwe’s second-largest city—began to speak about Moses.

“Even though Moses was in Egypt, he remembered that he was a Hebrew,” he said. “Moses realized, ‘Even though I’m in Egypt, I’m not an Egyptian. I don’t have to follow the ways of the land.’”

Emmanuel looked into earnest faces.

“Some people are amassing unjust gain. Do not follow that,” he said. “Live a righteous life even though we live in a sinful world.”

Emmanuel, a 2017 theology graduate of Solusi University outside Bulawayo, has a unique opportunity to share Christ. As a Global Mission pioneer, he has been seeking ways to reach out to police officers, government workers, and university students who live and work in his district. By simply asking, he received permission to give a 30-minute devotional message at training courses for local and regional officers.

Emmanuel had much more to say about Moses at the training course.

“Moses chose to suffer with the Israelites rather than enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin for a season,” he said. Turning in his Bible to Hebrews 11:24, 25, he read, “By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter; choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.”

Police officers thanked Emmanuel afterward. “This is the devotional we need,” said one. “It tells us things that we don’t want to hear but we must hear.”

“It was a word of rebuke and correction,” said another. “God blessed me today.”

Emmanuel invited the officers to enroll in free Voice of Prophecy Bible studies and gave each a book.

No police officers have requested baptism, but Emmanuel is sure that the Holy Spirit is at work. After just two months of his Global Mission pioneer work, five university students in his district were ready for baptism.

As Emmanuel pushes ahead, he is eager to keep preaching righteousness. “Like Moses, we must always stand for the right, even though the tide of the time says we should be corrupt,” he said.
