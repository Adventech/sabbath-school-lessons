>“So do we destroy the law by following the way of faith? No! Faith causes us to be what the law truly wants” (Romans 3:31, ICB).

In Romans 4 Paul explains that we are saved by faith alone. This truth is at the heart of the Protestant Reformation. The Reformation was a time when people in the 1500s began to “wake up” to Bible truths. These people wanted to make the Catholic Church better. The changes they made led to the start of the Protestant churches. The Reformation began 500 years ago this week.

In Romans 4, Paul uses Abraham as an example of someone who is holy. But even Abraham needed to be saved by grace. Grace is God’s gift of mercy, forgiveness, and power over sin. Abraham could not be saved by his own works or by obeying the law. Instead, Abraham had to be saved by grace. So does everyone else.

In Romans 4, Paul lists three major parts of God’s plan to save us: (1) the promise of grace; (2) our answer to that promise; and (3) God’s announcement that everyone who believes in Jesus is made right with Him.

Paul proves that our being saved is by faith alone. As proof of this truth, Paul points to Genesis 15:6. Here, in one of the earliest pages of the Bible, we find the teaching about how we are made right with God by faith alone.
