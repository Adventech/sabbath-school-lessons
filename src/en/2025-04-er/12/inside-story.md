### “Tell Us About the Bible”

The woman didn’t want help when Kim Sun arrived at her house.

Sun asked, “Why? Have I done something to upset you?”

The woman said, “No, no. I want you to take a break. You need to rest. You have more people to help around the neighborhood this afternoon. Here, eat some cookies and relax.”

The woman’s kindness touched Sun’s heart. Sun helped people free of charge since he arrived in the village three months ago. Sun didn’t tell the villagers he was a Bible worker. He ­wanted to be their friend and show them God’s love first. For three months the villagers accepted Sun’s help without thinking about his needs. But now, this woman showed that she cared about him. Sun knew that he made his first real friend in the village.

But the woman wasn’t his last friend. Around the same time, many villagers began to think of Sun as their friend. They started to ask him many questions.

One villager asked, “Why are you helping us for free?”

Another said, “Where are you from?”

Sun said he was a Bible worker with the 1,000 Missionary Movement. Sun added, “I want you to know Jesus, so I chose to serve you to show you His love for you.”

The villagers were amazed to learn that Sun was a Bible worker. They said, “If you’re a Bible worker, why don’t you tell us all about the Bible?”

Sun asked, “Do you really want to study the Bible?”

“Yes!” the villagers said. “Teach us about the Bible.”

Before long, no one wanted Sun’s help as a handyman anymore. Everyone was studying the Bible with Sun. A few people didn’t ask for Bible studies at first. But they agreed when Sun invited them. After three months of Sun’s helping them free of charge, how could the villagers say no?

Sun remembered the mistake he made with his parents. As a new Seventh-day Adventist, Sun tried to convince his parents to accept his beliefs. He failed for five years. Now he taught the villagers that each Bible truth showed God’s love.

Sun shared the Bible story about how God made everything. Sun said, “This story shows God’s love for you.” Next, Sun read the picture stories about the Good Samaritan and the Lost Son. Sun said, “These picture stories show God’s love for you, also.” Then Sun told the villagers that Jesus died on the cross for them. Sun said, “The cross shows God’s love for you, too.”

Kim Sun is a manager for the 1,000 Missionary Movement, in Silang, Philippines. The headquarters were built with help of the 13th Sabbath Offering from 1996. Read more about Sun next week.
