Read Ellen G. White, “The Last Words of Joshua,” pages 521, 522, in Patriarchs and Prophets.

“God is the Life-Giver. From the beginning, God’s laws gave life. But sin broke God’s law and His peace. Sin caused evil to fill the earth. As long as sin continues, suffering and death will happen. But the Savior became sin for us. He accepted its penalty for us. So, now we have hope. Because of Jesus, we can escape the terrible penalty of sin.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, page 522, adapted.

**Discussion Questions:**

`Look at all the proof in your life that God loves you. Share some examples with the class. At the same time, what should you do when things don’t happen the way you hope or pray for? What do you do when you ask God to keep His promises, and He is silent?`

`Talk about what the Bible teaches about God’s anger. Why is God’s anger a part of the Good News?`

`What important rules can you take from this week’s lesson about friendship with people who don’t believe in God? How can we be friends and, at the same time, honor God? What important rules can help us to do that and keep us safe while we serve our friends who don’t know Jesus?`

`What are some of the things that keep you from holding on tight to the Lord with all your heart? How can you let go of them?`
