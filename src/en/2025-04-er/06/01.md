Joshua 7; Joshua 7:16–19; Joshua 7:19–21; Joshua 8:1–29; Joshua 7:6–9.

> <p>Memory Verse</p>
> “ ‘But I, the Lord, look inside a person’s mind. I see what he thinks and what he feels. I see how everyone lives, and I see the things that they [people] do. I give to each one what he deserves [the reward he should have]’ ” (Jeremiah 17:10, EASY).

In Joshua 7, the Israelites have a terrible experience. This experience teaches the Israelites why they must honor their agreement with God. When the Israelites obey God, they win their wars. When the Israelites disobey God, they lose. The Lord is a mighty Warrior. Israel’s military success depends on God, not on a big army or clever battle plans. When the Lord goes with the Israelites to war, they win.

During the time that the Israelites fought to win the Promised Land, they learned a hard lesson. The lesson they learned was that their worst enemy was within their own camp. The walls and the strong cities were big problems. But the Israelites had a bigger problem than these things. Their problem was that their own people were very stubborn. They didn’t want to do what the Lord asked.

We have the same problem today as we wait for God to give us the things that He promised (1 Peter 1:4; Colossians 3:24). While we wait on the “border” of the Promised Land, God tests our faith. We can pass the test. But only if we give ourselves completely to Jesus.
