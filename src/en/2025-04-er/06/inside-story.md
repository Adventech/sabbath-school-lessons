### Giving God Back His Things—Part 1

Frank Mukube ran out of money after he moved to a new town in Namibia. Frank rented a house and bought furniture with a loan: a bed, couch, stove, radio, television, rug, and pots for his kitchen.

Frank got a new job as a teacher. He made a budget for his expenses each month and followed it carefully. At first, Frank had no trouble giving tithe and offerings and paying his loan. Tithe is 10% of all the money we get. But then new expenses came up. Soon Frank didn’t have enough money for everything. So, he stopped giving tithe and offerings. Frank felt terrible. So, he prayed. “Lord, what shall I do?” Frank needed two years to pay the loan back. But in Malachi 3:8, 9, the Lord says to His people, “ ‘A man should not rob God. But you are robbing me.’ But you ask, ‘How do we rob you?’ I say, ‘You do not give to me the tithes and the offerings that you should give.’ Yes, all of you are robbing me. The whole nation [people group] of Israel is guilty. So you will receive the punishment of a curse’ ” (EASY).

Two years passed. Frank felt terrible until the day he paid back the loan. But Frank didn’t feel the joy he expected to feel when he paid back the loan. He felt worse. So, he decided to take everything he bought back to the store. The first person who learned about Frank’s plan was his boss at the school where Frank taught. Frank asked for permission to leave school for a few hours. He said, “I need to take my stuff back to the store.”

His boss asked, “Didn’t you pay for all of it already?”

Frank said, “Yes. But I want to take everything back. . . .These things are separating me from God because I didn’t give God the money that belonged to Him.”

Frank’s boss laughed in his face. “You can’t take those things back! Are you crazy?” But his boss let Frank go.

Frank went to his rented house. He announced his decision to his brother, who moved in with him a little while ago. His brother thought Frank was crazy, too.

Frank said, “It’s not good to sleep in a house with things that are cursed. I used God’s money to pay for these things.”

Then Frank went to the store and talked with the ­manager. The manager looked up Frank’s bill on the computer. The manager saw that Frank didn’t owe any money. The manager asked, “You want to give these things back? Are you crazy?”

Frank told the man he was fine.

The manager said, “We can’t give you any money for these things.” Frank didn’t care. So, the manager printed out a piece of paper for Frank to sign. The paper said that Frank was giving back everything for free.
