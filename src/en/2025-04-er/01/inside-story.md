### Worshiping a Tree

Sudhakar was a church pioneer at a hospital center in Thailand. Sudhakar noticed the strange tree right away when he arrived at work. Colorful ribbons were tied to the branches. Small statues of stone and wood sat in a circle around the roots. Someone put bananas, apples, and burning perfume sticks in the trunk of the tree. Sudhakar learned that the townspeople believed that a spirit of their ancestors lived in the tree. So, the people worshiped the tree.

The spirit tree stood on land that a kind-hearted woman gave to the Seventh-day Adventist hospital. Sudhakar was confused because he didn’t understand why the community people came to the hospital to worship the spirit tree. A pastor explained that the townspeople worshiped the spirit tree long before the lady gave the land to the church.

Sudhakar understood that the people might get upset if the ribbons, statues, fruit, and other objects suddenly disappeared.

But Sudhakar decided to do something about the spirit tree. He prayed about it to God. Sudhakar also became friends with the community leader and other townspeople. Sudhakar invited them all to cooking classes, English classes, and worship services in the new worship center near the spirit tree. Little by little, Sudhakar started to clean up the tree. Sudhakar removed the ribbons, the statues, the bananas, apples, and perfume sticks. The work took Sudhakar about a week.

No one in the community said a word to him about his cleaning up the spirit tree.

Not long after, Sudhakar walked past the tree after he taught a class. A strange voice said his name. The voice came from the tree! The voice offered Sudhakar a lot of money if Sudhakar would obey him.

But Sudhakar didn’t want the money. He didn’t want anything from the spirit. He wanted the spirit to go away. Sudhakar said, “I command you in Jesus’ name to leave and never come back.”

Three days later, Sudhakar noticed that the tree was dying. All of its leaves fell off. Four weeks later, the tree was completely dead. Sudhakar chopped the tree down with an ax.

The townspeople were amazed! Soon everyone in the community knew what happened to the tree. When they heard what happened, many people came to the new worship center at the hospital. Sudhakar taught the townspeople to pray only to the God of heaven. Seven people started to attend church at the worship center. Later, they were baptized.

Pray for pioneers the same as Sudhakar who are starting churches in places where people don’t know Jesus. Learn more about Global Mission pioneers: https://bit.ly/GMPioneers.
