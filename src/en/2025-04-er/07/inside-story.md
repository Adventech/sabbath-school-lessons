### Giving God Back His Things—Part 2

The store sent a delivery truck to Frank’s house. The truck came to collect the things that Frank Mukube bought with a loan from the store. Frank already paid back the loan. But he wanted to give the stuff back to the store anyway. Frank signed a paper saying that he didn’t want any of his money back. Now Frank rode in the truck to the house he rented in Namibia.

As the truck backed up to the house, Frank’s property mana­ger, who lived nearby, ran over. She asked, “Why are you moving out without telling me first?”

Frank said, “I’m not moving. I’m giving back my stuff to the store. These things aren’t really mine, even if I fully paid for them. I want to give tithe and offerings again.” Tithe is 10% of all the money we get.

The property manager asked, “What are you saying about tithe and offerings?”

Frank explained. The Bible teaches that people should give tithe and offerings. Frank told the manger that he didn’t give any tithe for two years. He used his tithe and offerings each month to pay for everything he bought on loan from the store.

The property manager laughed at Frank.

Then the delivery truck and Frank went back to the store. The store manager watched as the bed, couch, stove, radio, television, rug, and kitchen pots were unloaded. The store manager asked, “Why are you really doing this?”

Frank said, “These things stood between me and my God because I bought them with my tithes and offerings. Now I feel so much better.”

Frank did feel better. He knew that without a bed, he would sleep on the floor. Without a stove, he would need to find firewood and pots to cook supper with over a fire. But Frank was happy. Before, he felt cursed because he robbed God (Malachi 3:8, 9). But with everything back in the store, he felt peace.

That night, Frank didn’t need to sleep on the floor or look for firewood or pots for supper. A friend’s heart was touched when he heard about Frank’s decision. The friend brought over a bed and an old stove with two pots.

Frank said, “God gave me a bed. God gave me a stove.” God promises to bless us if we give Him tithe and offerings: “ ‘Now you must bring the whole tithe that belongs to me. Store it in my temple, so that there will be food in my house. Obey me and then see what I will do. . . . You will see how much I will bless you! You will not have enough room to store all the good things that I will give to you. I will pour blessings out of the sky like [as] rain’ ” (Malachi 3:10, EASY). Since that day, Frank always gives God his tithe and offerings.
