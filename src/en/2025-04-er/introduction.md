### Second Chances: The Book of Joshua

The book of Joshua starts with a change in Israel’s leadership. Moses is dead. Now Joshua is the new leader. The book also tells the story about how Israel enters the Promised Land. At the end of the book, Israel is settled in the land.

After 40 years in the desert, Joshua must do what Moses never did. Joshua must lead Israel across the Jordan River and into the land of Canaan. God made a promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob many years before to give them this land.

The Lord says to Joshua, “ ‘My servant Moses is dead. Now you and all these people must go across the Jordan River. You must go into the land I am giving to the Israelites’ ” (Joshua 1:2, ERV).

Joshua will not do this work alone. The Lord will help Him. The Lord wanted to bring His people into the Promised Land 40 years earlier. But the Israelites didn’t have faith in God’s promises. The people broke their agreement with God. So, they were forced to wander in the desert for 40 years.

During those 40 years, Israel often fought against God. Every adult person in Israel who walked across the Red Sea died in the desert. Caleb and Joshua were the only adults in Israel from that time who entered the Promised Land. Four of Moses’ five books tell the story about what happened to the Israelites as they wandered in the desert for 40 years. The children of the Israelites who died in the desert are now grown. They are ready to win the Promised Land. Joshua also is ready to lead these Israelites into the Promised Land.

“Then Moses called [sent for] Joshua. All the Israelites watched while Moses said to Joshua, ‘Be strong and brave. You will lead these people into the land that the Lord promised to give to their ancestors. You will help the Israelites take [win] that land and divide it among [between] them. The Lord will lead you. He himself is with you. He will not fail you or leave you. Don’t worry. Don’t be afraid!’ ” (Deuteronomy 31:7, 8, ERV).

Moses is talking about the promises that God made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob hundreds of years ago. Now God is about to keep those promises. The Israelites are excited. They were homeless for so long. Now God will give them a new beginning. God saved the Israelites from slavery. So, the people can trust Him to keep His promises about the land.

“The book of Joshua was written to tell the story about how Israel entered the Promised Land and won it. The book of Joshua also tells how Joshua divided the land and gave it to the different family groups of Israel. The message of the book of Joshua is that God’s people can trust Him. That’s because He kept His promise about the land to Abraham and to His people (Joshua 21:43–45).”—Andrews Bible Commentary (Andrews University Press, 2020), page 365, adapted.

This quarter, we will discover that we have many of the same problems today that Joshua had in his time. How did Joshua solve these problems? What lessons can we learn from him? Joshua’s example will help us to trust in God’s promises, just as he did. When we trust in God, He will give us success.
