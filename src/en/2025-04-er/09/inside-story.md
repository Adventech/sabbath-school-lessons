### Not the Best Way to Share Jesus

Kim Sun, a South Korean teenager, studied at the Adventist University of the Philippines. Not long ago, Sun invited a man to Bible meetings. The man got baptized. Sun wondered if he could earn a living knocking on doors and inviting people to Bible meetings. Sun wasn’t Seventh-day Adventist. This expe­rience was his first time going door-to-door.

Sun talked with a pastor who went door-to-door with Sun and the other students. Sun asked, “What is the name of the work we are doing? Is this community work?”

The pastor smiled. “No, it’s work for God or mission work.”

Sun asked, “Can someone do this work full-time?”

The pastor said, “Yes. It’s called being a Bible worker.”

Sun asked, “Can I have this job?”

The pastor said, “Yes. The pay for this job is very little. But you can do it.”

Sun asked, “How do I start?”

The pastor answered, “You’ll need to change your studies from nursing to religion.”

Sun said, “Oh. I’ll need to ask my mom first.”

Sun was studying in the Philippines because his parents wanted him to do something special with his life. Before Sun came to the Philippines, he lived to please himself.

Sun asked his mother if he could study religion and not nursing. He wanted to serve the church. Mother said he could study religion if he also finished his nursing studies.

Sun said, “But I don’t really like nursing.”

Then Mother had an idea. She didn’t want her son to be rich. She wanted him to be a good person. She said, “If you study religion, can you drink or smoke?”

When he said no, she said, “Then please change your ­studies!”

Sun loved studying religion. He learned the Bible truth about the seventh-day Sabbath. He read the end-time messages about Daniel and Revelation. Then he got baptized.

When Sun went home for vacations, he tried to ask his parents to accept his new beliefs. Sun said, “Mom and Dad, sit down and let me talk to you. Sunday is not the Sabbath day. Saturday is the Sabbath. Do you know Daniel’s explanation about King Nebuchadnezzar’s dream?”

Sun didn’t understand why his parents didn’t want to learn about Bible truth. He was upset when Mother finally asked him to stop preaching. She said, “You take your God. I’ll take mine!”

Sun said, “But they’re the same God! We must obey the Bible.”
