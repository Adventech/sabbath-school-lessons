> <p>Memory Verse</p>
> “Prisoners, go home! Now you have something to hope for. I am telling you now, I am coming back to you” (Zechariah 9:12, ERV).

Joshua 13–21 contains long lists. These lists talk about the land that God gave to the different family groups in Israel. For the modern reader, these lists may seem boring. But the lists teach us a very important Bible truth. God made a promise to give His people land. The lists are proof that God kept His promise. At the same time, the Israelites worked with the Lord to make those promises happen.

Yes, the land was a gift from God. God promised this land to Israel’s fathers. But Israel had a part to do, too: “ ‘I have given you all this land. Go in and take it as your own. The Lord promised he would give the land to your fathers. He promised it to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. He also said he would give it to their children after them’ ” (Deuteronomy 1:8, NIrV).

This week, we will look at the Bible truths that the Promised Land teaches us. We will try to understand what these Bible truths mean for us today.
