> <p>Memory Verse</p>
> “That had never happened before, and it has never happened again. That was the day the Lord obeyed a man. The Lord really was fighting for Israel!” (Joshua 10:14, ERV).

The book of Joshua is filled with many wars. God commanded His people to fight these wars. God helped His people to win. We see this idea all through the book of Joshua (Joshua 10:11). God talks about fighting for Israel (Joshua 6:2; Joshua 8:1). Joshua also says that God will help Israel fight and win (Joshua 4:23, 24; Joshua 8:7). Rahab says the same thing (Joshua 2:10). So do the spies (Joshua 2:24) and God’s people (Joshua 24:18). God also says that He starts these wars.

For sure, God’s announcement may fill us with surprise. If God is love, why does He fight? Why did His people fight so many wars during Old Testament times? (Read Exodus 34:6; Psalm 86:15; Psalm 103:8; Psalm 108:4.)

This week and next, we will answer the difficult question about the wars that God commanded Israel to fight. Why did God command wars in the book of Joshua and elsewhere?
