### “What Do You Want?”

_by Laurie Denski-Snyman_

A Bible worker and his local partner visited a non-Christian neighborhood to sell Bible books. The neighborhood was in a big city in southern Asia. The Bible workers saw that the people who lived there were very religious because of the type of clothing they wore. Women wore long scarves or head coverings. Men had long beards. Some people had dark spots on their skin above their eyes. The spots came from bowing their faces to the floor during long prayers.

At one house a man with an angry face came to the front gate. He didn’t open the gate. In a mean voice, the man asked the Bible workers, “What do you want?”

David, one of the Bible workers, said, “We are selling books in your community. Do you want to look at the books?”

The man said very angrily, “I’ll be back in just a minute.” Then he left.

The Bible worker’s partner, Maria, was afraid. She said, “Let’s pray. That man looks scary.”

David said, “Maybe he’s just hungry.” At that time of year, non-Christian religious men in that county didn’t eat any food during the day for a whole month.

Then the man came back. He said, “Why don’t you come in?”

Inside the house, he said, “What do you want?”

David pulled some health books from his bag.

The man looked interested. He said, “My wife is a health worker. She will be very interested in those books.” The man called his wife to come and look at the books on health.

As the man and his wife looked at the books, the man said, “Wow! These books are really good. The information looks helpful.” Then the man asked, “Who do you work for?”

David said, “We are Seventh-day Adventists.”

The man stood up and walked away. Then he came back and sat down. He stared at the visitors. No one said anything.

Then the man’s wife broke the silence. She said, “You know, I have Adventist patients. They are very good people. But I don’t really know much about them.”

Her husband started to walk back and forth. He appeared to be upset. Then he sat down again.

His wife asked, “What other books do you have?”

David opened his bag and pulled out The Great Controversy. He said, “This book is all about love, forgiveness, and peace.” The wife was happy to look at it. She asked, “What are your religious beliefs?” When the woman said this, her husband stood up and walked over to where they stood. The man pulled out his cell phone and started to record their conversation!
