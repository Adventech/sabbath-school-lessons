### The Man No One Expected to Do God’s Work

Kim Sun was surprised when the young man slammed the door shut in his face.

Sun was a 19-year-old student from South Korea. Sun went from door-to-door to invite people to Bible meetings in the Philippines. Many people were polite to Sun and his friends when the students knocked on their doors. But the young man at this house was mean and nasty. The young man didn’t answer when the students asked him if they could come in for a visit. The young man just slammed the door shut.

Sun felt ashamed and upset. The experience didn’t bother the other students. Sun didn’t understand why. Sun suggested that they come back the next day, on Tuesday. The Bible meetings were being held all week, including the Sabbath.

On Tuesday, the students knocked on the door again. The same young man came to the door. He remembered them from the day before. The young man looked ashamed. He invited the students in. He said, “I’m sorry that I closed the door yesterday.”

The students talked with the young man about Jesus’ love. They invited the young man to the meetings. The students met with the young man again on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. On Saturday, the young man decided to give his heart to Jesus and get baptized.

The young man said, “I love Jesus. I want a new life.”

Sun was surprised. As Sun watched the baptism, he thought, “This man changed so much. He is so different from when I met him on Monday. Can someone really change so much?”

But what happened to this man happened to Sun, too. No one, including Sun, expected Sun to become a Bible worker. Sun didn’t come to the Philippines to baptize people. In the past, Sun lived to please himself in South Korea. Then his parents put a stop to that. They sent Sun to the Philippines to learn English and to become a nurse. Sun’s parents wanted him to go to the United States to work after he finished school.

Sun’s parents sent him to the Adventist University of the Philippines. There, Sun was surprised to see that his classmates went to church on Saturday. Sun thought that all Christians worshiped on Sunday. Sun went to a Korean-language church at his school. Young people in the church helped the pastors get ready for the Bible meetings. Sun didn’t know much English. He didn’t know much about the Bible. But he joined the students in going door-to-door to invite people to the meetings. That’s how Sun first became a worker for God without planning to.

Kim Sun is a manager for the 1,000 Missionary Movement, in Silang, Philippines. The headquarters were built with help of the 13th Sabbath Offering from 1996. Read more next week.
