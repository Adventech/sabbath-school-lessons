### God’s Helping Hands

Kim Sun was excited to be sent to a part of the Philippines that was far away from any city. Sun was going to serve as a Bible worker for 10 months.

But Sun wondered what the best way was to serve Jesus during this time. Sun remembered how he argued with his parents about the Bible for five years. He didn’t convince them to accept any Bible truth he taught. Now Sun had only 10 months.

As Sun prayed, he thought, “If I try to start with Bible teachings, people may reject the Bible, the same as my parents. Maybe I first need to show everyone Jesus’ love.”

Sun decided not to tell anyone that he was a Bible worker. He wouldn’t try to talk about Bible teachings at first. He would just make friends for three months and help people.

When Sun arrived in the village, he visited each of the 20 to 30 homes there. Sun offered to help his new neighbors.

Sun asked the woman at the first house if she needed help with anything. “Please let me know how I may help you.”

The woman was happy to accept Sun’s nice offer.

Sun helped 17 people in the neighborhood that first day. The first woman he visited made him lunch and supper as Sun worked.

As Sun walked home, he felt tired. But he thought, “I’m God’s helping hands!”

Soon, Sun had a long list of names of people to visit who wanted his help. From Monday to Friday, Sun visited two homes in the morning and two homes in the afternoon.

Sun also was a friend in other ways to the villagers. Sun grew corn and gave it away. When people asked how much money they owed for the corn, Sun said, “Nothing! The corn came from God. God paid the price for you.” Sometime later, Sun saw a boy with a deep cut in his leg. Sun put medicine on the cut. The cut healed a few days later. The parents came to Sun and asked, “How can we thank you?”

Sun served the villagers for three months. He didn’t tell them he was a Bible worker at that time. Sun wasn’t keeping this information secret. Nobody asked him about it. Sun prayed about what to do for his next three months.
