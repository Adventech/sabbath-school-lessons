### Trusting in God’s Timing

For four years, Kim Sun argued with his parents about the Bible every time he came home to South Korea on vacation. Sun was studying religion at the Adventist University of the Philippines. After Sun finished school, he kept talking to his parents about the teachings of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Then Sun started his master’s studies in religion. He continued to fight with his parents about Bible teachings. The fights got so bad that members at Sun’s parents’ church started to pray. They prayed that Sun’s parents wouldn’t leave their church. Finally, Mother asked Sun to stop talking about the Bible.

Sun felt upset until he heard a sermon. The preacher of the sermon said that God has a special plan for each person’s life. The sermon helped Sun understand that his plan for his parents may not be God’s plan. Sun decided to pray and trust God’s timing. He didn’t talk to his parents about the Bible for two years.

In the meantime, Sun finished his master’s and got a job with the church. Sun wished with all his heart to work as a pastor. But he didn’t get a job offer.

As time passed, Mother started to wonder if her own beliefs were keeping her son from getting a job. Mother heard someone ask Sun if his parents were Seventh-day Adventists. Sun said that his parents belonged to another church. Mother asked Sun, “Would it help you to get a job if we joined your church?”

Sun understood that his parents were worried about his future. But he didn’t want them to become Seventh-day Adventists for that reason. He wanted them to join the church because they believed in its message. Sun said, “Mom, that would not help me. You need to study the Bible for yourself and then decide.”

Sun introduced his parents to a Seventh-day Adventist pastor in their area. The pastor started to study the Bible with them. Nothing Sun said convinced his parents for the last five years. But now, as they studied the Bible, they saw Jesus’ love in the Seventh-day Adventist teachings. After two months, Sun’s parents joined the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

Sun was so happy! He was the first Seventh-day Adventist in his family. Now his parents joined him in his faith. Sun remembered the joy he felt many years ago in the Philippines when a man’s life changed after Sun introduced him to Jesus. After that experience, Sun wanted to work for God full-time.

Now, Sun decided to go back to the Philippines to work for God.
