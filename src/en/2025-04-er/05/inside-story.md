### “God Brought You Here”

_by Laurie Denski-Snyman_

Maria and David were Bible workers. Maria felt nervous as the man came near them in his home in a big city in southern Asia. The man recorded their conversation on his cell phone. The man waited for them to answer his wife’s question about their religious beliefs.

David said, “As I said, we are Seventh-day Adventists.”

The man asked, “Does that mean you are Christians?”

David prayed silently for wisdom. He knew that many people in that country didn’t like Christianity. Many Christians drank alcohol and ate foods that weren’t clean. The religion of that country did not allow its followers to do those things.

David answered, “Let me explain. We believe what Moses says. In Deuteronomy 6:4, Moses wrote, ‘The Lord is our God. The Lord is the only [there is no other] God.’ [ERV]. So, we believe there is one God. This verse tells us that.”

The man said, “Interesting.”

David said, “We also believe in the Sabbath. Moses’ law says that we should worship the Lord on the Sabbath. The Sabbath starts Friday at sunset and continues until Saturday at sunset.”

Then David talked about how the Lord said that eating pork was a sin, in Isaiah 66:17. The man continued to record the conversation. But his angry frown slowly became a smile.

David continued, “We believe our bodies are God’s temple. While we live on earth, we must take care of them.”

The man’s smile grew big.

David added, “We don’t believe in hurting our bodies. So, we do not drink alcohol or smoke.”

The man said, “I believe God brought you to me.” He got up and left the room. Then he came back with a plate of food. The man put the food on the table and asked the visitors to eat.

Then the man said a prayer. He thanked God for the meeting. He asked God to bless the food. After that, the man brought his adult son from a back room. The man said to his son, “I want you to meet these people.” Then the man said to David and Maria, “I want to share my family with you.” The man said he was sorry that he and his family couldn’t eat with them. But they were fasting. When people fast, they don’t eat food for a short time.

As David and Maria ate, the man asked them questions about The Great Controversy. The man said, “We are happy you came today. We know that God sent you here. We will accept you. Peace be with you.”

As the visitors got ready to leave, the man blessed them. He said, “May you have peace and blessings as you visit with people in our neighborhoods.”
