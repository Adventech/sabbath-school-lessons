### “Don’t Worry. God Will Help.”

Inácio Manoel sold Bible books for a living in Brazil. Inácio knocked on the door of the house. A woman answered. When she learned who Inácio was, she yelled, “I hate Christians!”

Inácio was surprised. The woman’s house was the first house he visited on his first day of work as a Bible bookseller. Inácio also planned to offer Bible studies to people.

Inácio and a friend went to the next house. A big dog barked at them in the yard. Inácio’s friend was not happy that they met an angry woman at the first house and an angry dog at the second house. Inácio told his friend not to worry. “God is with us.”

A woman came out of the house and led the dog away. Then the woman invited Inácio and his friend inside. The three of them had a heart-to-heart conversation. The woman told Inácio and his friend about her troubles since her husband went to prison. The next Sabbath, the woman came to church with her three young children. Inácio was amazed. He told God that he wanted to lead people to Him for the rest of his life.

Inácio’s biggest surprise came when they visited the third house that day. The woman who lived there was named Edileuza. Edileuza agreed to Bible studies on Saturday afternoons. As they studied together week after week, they came to the Bible truth about the seventh-day Sabbath. Edileuza worked two jobs. She was a housekeeper. She also painted ladies’ finger­nails for a living. She didn’t think she could take Sabbaths off.

Edileuza explained, “I make the most money on that day of the week. So, I need to work Sabbaths. What else can I do?”

Inácio said, “Don’t worry. God will help. He has something better for you.”

At the next Bible study, Edileuza said that she met a stranger on the street. The man said he needed a good housekeeper and asked her if she knew anyone who could do the job. Best of all, the housekeeping job gave her the Sabbath off.

Edileuza smiled as she shared the story with Inácio. She said, “I love my new job as housekeeper. Now my pay is three times more than I earned before in both of my old jobs.”

Edileuza was baptized. Later, the rest of her family also got baptized.

Inácio is now 68 years old. For the past 36 years, 4 to 11 people get baptized every year because of him. Everywhere he goes, he carries Bible lessons with him. Every night he prays, “Lord, put someone in my path, so I can share Your love.”

Inácio says, “I can live without everything in this life except Bible studies.” This quarter’s 13th Sabbath offering will help build a church in the area where Inácio lives. Watch a short YouTube video of Inácio at: https://bit.ly/Inacio-Brazil.
