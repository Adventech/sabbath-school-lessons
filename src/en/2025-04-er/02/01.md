### Read for This Week’s Lesson

Joshua 2:1; Joshua 2:2–11; James 2:25; Joshua 2:12–21; Joshua 9:1–20.

> <p>Memory Verse</p>
> “Rahab was a woman who used her body wrongly for sex to get money. But she believed in God, so she did not die with the people who did not believe in God. This was when the men came to spy out her country. She took them into her house in peace” (Hebrews 11:31, WE).

Do you sometimes ask yourself, “Why did I do that again?” Most of us say these words at some time in our lives. For sure, we all make mistakes. So, who doesn’t wish for a second chance to make things right?

Israel gets a second chance to enter the Promised Land. Joshua wants Israel to succeed. So, Joshua sends two spies to bring him valuable information about the land. Joshua wants to know how much water the Canaanites have. Are the Canaanites ready for battle? How strong are their city walls? Are they afraid to go to war with Israel?

Some people may think the Israelites didn’t need to do anything to get the land. God promised to give it to them, right? But do God’s promises mean that He expects us to do nothing? Of course not! Now Israel stands at the border of Canaan for a second time. The last time the Israelites were at the border, they didn’t get to enter the Promised Land.

This week, we will look at two of the most interesting stories in the book of Joshua. We will learn how these stories can make our faith strong today.
