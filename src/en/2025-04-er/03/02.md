`Why did God ask the Israelites to prepare for the things that were about to happen? Read Joshua 3:1–5 and Numbers 14:41–44 for the answer.`

In Joshua 3:1–5, we read about the ark of God’s promise for the first time in the book of Joshua. Before this time, where else does the Bible talk about the ark? Moses talks about the ark, together with God’s holy tent (Exodus 40:21). Moses also talks about the ark and Israel’s journey from Sinai (Numbers 10:33–36). We read about the ark when the Israelites try to start winning the Promised Land and fail (Numbers 14:44). The ark was the most holy object in the Israelite holy tent. Three things were kept inside the ark. Each of these things showed Israel’s special relationship with God: (1) The Ten Commandments; (2) Aaron’s special stick; and (3) a jar of manna or bread from heaven (Exodus 16:33; Hebrews 9:4).

Israel did special things to get ready to cross the Jordan. The people also took the ark with them. These things helped the Israelites remember that God was leading them. They would win only if they followed God’s plan and schedule. The Bible says that God sits on His throne above the angels that cover the ark of God’s promise (Exodus 25:22; Numbers 7:89). The ark follows God. When God moves, the ark moves with Him. God enters Canaan in front of the Israelites. God leads His people in the fight to win the Promised Land.

Do you see the word or words in Joshua 3:5 written as “pure [clean]” (ERV), “holy” (ICB, NLV), “set yourselves apart [separate]” (NIrV), or “make yourselves ready” (EASY)? In the Hebrew language, this command means the things the priests or holy leaders did to become clean before they served God in His holy tent (Exodus 28:41; Exodus 29:1). The Israelites got clean before they met with God at Sinai (Exodus 19:10, 14). The people also needed to become clean before they fought in a war (Deuteronomy 23:14). What things did the people do to get clean? They stopped sinning. In Numbers 11:18, we see this same command to become clean. The people must become clean first. Then God can do a miracle for them.

When Israel crosses the Jordan River, God will prove to His people that they can trust His promise. He will give them the Promised Land.
