### Sweatshirts and Tears

Tsitsi Zondo didn’t want to believe what she saw. It was a dark night in Zimbabwe. But her precious cargo of sweatshirts lay across the highway. She saw people in the road in the dark. They picked up the sweatshirts and then ran off with them.

Tears filled Tsisti’s eyes. Tsitsi borrowed money to buy the sweatshirts in South Africa. Now there was no way she could pay back the loan. Tsitsi had nothing. How would she take care of her children?

Tsitsi prayed. “Lord, You know that I’ve worked so hard to make my business a success. Now this awful thing happened. Of all the bags on the bus, my bag is the only one that fell open.”

Earlier, Tsitsi packed 60 sweatshirts into a large bag. Then Tsitsi stored the bag on the roof of a bus for the trip home. The bus drove from Zimbabwe’s border with South Africa to Tsitsi’s home in Bulawayo. Halfway during the trip, a passenger got off the bus. The bus driver searched for the passenger’s bag on the roof of the bus. The bus driver opened and closed many bags on the roof of the bus. Somehow, Tsitsi’s bag didn’t close.

The bus started its journey again. After the bus traveled for some time, the driver of the bus stopped when he saw the lights of a car flashing in his side mirror. The driver of the car said the bus was dropping sweatshirts ever since the last passenger got off.

Tsitsi checked her bag on the roof of the bus. She saw that she had only 10 sweatshirts left.

The bus driver knew that he was responsible for Tsitsi’s loss. But the driver told Tsitsi, “I’m so sorry. I don’t have the money to pay you back.”

After Tsitsi prayed, she wiped away her tears. Tsitsi always paid tithe and offerings on the goods she bought from South Africa. Tithe is 10% of all the money we get. This money belongs to God. Tsitsi was sure God would take care of her.

In Bulawayo, Tsitsi’s friends heard about what happened. Her friends prayed with her at her home. One friend gave her a loan to go back to South Africa and buy more sweatshirts.

Tsitsi accepted the money as an answer to prayer. She went back to South Africa. With the new sweatshirts she bought and sold, she delivered all the sweatshirts to her first customers. Tsitsi made a total of four trips to South Africa to pay back the two loans. But during that time, Tsitsi always had enough money for food and family expenses. She also kept paying tithe and offerings to the Lord.

Tsitsi doesn’t understand how God works. But she knows that He always takes care of our needs. Watch a short YouTube video of Tsitsi Zondo at: https://bit.ly/Tsitsi.
