### “How Do We Love God?”

Kim Sun was a Bible worker from South Korea. For three months, Sun shared 15 stories about God’s love with the people in a faraway village in the Philippines.

The villagers were surprised to learn that God made everything on earth for them. The villagers were amazed at Jesus’ picture stories about the Good Samaritan and the Lost Son. The hearts of the villagers were touched when they understood that Jesus died on the cross for them. After three months, many villagers said, “We understand that God loves us. But how do we show God that we love Him back?”

Sun thought to himself, “Yes. When we know someone loves us, we want to show that we love that person, too.” Sun knew it was time to teach the villagers deeper Bible truth.

For the next three months, Sun taught the villagers about the seventh-day Sabbath. He taught them about clean foods and foods that weren’t clean. He taught them about tithes and offerings, and other Bible teachings. Tithe is the money we owe God. Tithe is 10% of all the money we get. Many villagers accepted the Bible teachings. The villagers wanted to know how to love God. The Bible teachings showed them the way.

Sun served as a Bible worker for ten months. For three months, Sun helped the villagers. For the next three months, he told them Bible stories about God’s love. For the final three months, Sun taught them deeper Bible truths. Sun had one month left to say goodbye. Sun spent the last month going door-to-door, inviting people to follow Jesus. Then Sun said to the villagers, “I’m leaving soon. I would like you to join my church. My church has blessed my life so much. I want you to be blessed, too.” Many townspeople accepted Sun’s invitation.

Ellen G. White writes, “Jesus’ plan is the only plan that will give us real success in touching people’s hearts. The Savior made friends with people. He wanted what was best for them. He showed them that He cared. He helped them and took care of their needs. Jesus won their hearts. Then He invited them to ‘Follow Me.’ ”—The Ministry of Healing, page 143, adapted. For ten months, Sun followed Jesus’ plan. He made friends in the village. He showed the villagers he cared about them. He helped them. He won their trust. Then Sun invited them to follow Jesus.

Today, Sun is a full-time Bible worker. He is a manager for the 1,000 Missionary Movement, in Silang, Philippines. The headquarters were built with help of the 13th Sabbath Offering from 1996. Sun says, “Being a Bible worker is the best job on earth. Bible workers must do more than give Bible studies. We must show Jesus in our lives.”

Thank you for your 13th Sabbath Offering this week.
