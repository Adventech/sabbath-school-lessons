`Read Ecclesiastes 8:14. What powerful truth does this verse show us?`

It is bad enough that awful things happen to us. What makes it worse is when no one knows about it. It makes our pain feel as if it has no meaning. What if we lived on an earth without the promise that God will make everything right? That is an awful thought, right? That is exactly what Solomon is complaining about in Ecclesiastes 8:14. He says that life is not fair. 

But we can be thankful that Solomon did not stop there. Yes, life is not fair. But God is going to judge everything. So, we can be patient. Now everything and everyone has a reason for being here.

`Read Ecclesiastes 12:13, 14. What do these verses tell us about how everything we do in life is important?`

As Christians, we believe God is our Judge. This belief gives us hope. The Bible teaches us that we live on an earth that God made. He loves us. But sin has made an awful mess. Only God can clean it up. Jesus is part of God’s plan to clean things up and make things new. God’s work as our Judge is part of that plan too. That is why God’s work as our Judge is wonderful news. It is a promise that God will make things right again.

`What does it mean to you to know that God will make things right again? What hope does this promise give you?`

*Sin has made an awful mess. Only God can clean it up.*
