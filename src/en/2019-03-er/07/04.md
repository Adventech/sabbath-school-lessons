There are many stories in the Bible about Jesus’ miracles. Isaiah told us about these miracles hundreds of years before they happened. Jesus made the blind see. He healed people who were sick. Sometimes these people were sick for many years before Jesus healed them (read Mark 5:24–34; John 5:1–15). Jesus made lame people walk again. He healed lepers. Lepers were people with awful skin problems. People in Jesus’ day looked down on lepers because they were “not clean.” People were afraid to come near the lepers or touch them. But Jesus healed them with a touch. Jesus saved people from demons too. The demons controlled people’s minds and bodies. Jesus also woke up people from the dead.

Jesus often told the people He healed not to tell anyone He healed them. Many people did not do what Jesus asked. Why did Jesus want no one to know? Jesus’ miracles were not about showing off His power. He also knew His power made the religious leaders jealous. Jesus healed people because He wanted them to accept His gift of everlasting life.

Jesus also healed people because He wanted to show His love for humans. Jesus showed His love for humans when He fed 5,000 people. Matthew tells us, “When Jesus got out of the boat, he saw a large crowd of people. He felt sorry for them, and he healed the ones who were sick” (Matthew 14:14, ERV). Jesus felt the pain of the people who were hurting because they were sick and in trouble. Jesus always tried to help everyone He met and healed them.

`Read Isaiah’s words in Matthew 12:15–21. Jesus’ healing miracles were about more than healing sick people. What was Jesus also trying to do when He healed people?`

“Jesus’ miracles showed that He was God. He did the work that God’s special messengers talked about. But Jesus’ works of mercy made the religious leaders mad. They did not feel pity for people in pain. Many times, the religious leaders caused the suffering that Jesus stopped. That is why the leaders did not like Jesus’ miracles.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, page 406, adapted. 

Jesus’ healing miracles showed His love. They showed that He was fair and kind. But they also showed that Jesus came to save the ones He healed. Everything Jesus did was to lead people to accept everlasting life (read John 17:3).

*People were afraid to come near the lepers or touch them. But Jesus healed them with a touch.*
