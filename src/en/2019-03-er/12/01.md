**READ FOR THIS WEEK’S LESSON**: Matthew 6:25–33; James 1:5–8; Leviticus 25:35–37; Matthew 5:9; Isaiah 58:1–10.

> “A light shines in the dark for those [people] who are good, for those [people] who are merciful [show mercy], kind, and fair. It is good for people to be kind and generous [giving] and to be fair in business” (Psalm 112:4, 5, ERV). 

THE BIBLE SHOWS US many examples of God’s love for the poor. He cares about people who are used and hurt badly by their leaders. He asks His people to help these suffering people. God’s command to us to take care of the poor and suffering will not end until Jesus comes back. Then He will make everything right. 

Until then, evil is everywhere. Satan and his angels work hard to make evil happen. They cause people to become poor. Satan and his evil angels cause leaders to hurt their people. The devil causes slavery, selfishness, and greed. In this life, our communities, churches, and families need to stand strong against these evils. It will be hard to do so. But we must do it anyway. We must show love to people. We must have the courage to “ ‘be fair to other people. Love kindness [being kind] and loyalty, and humbly [having no pride] obey your God’ ” (Micah 6:8, ERV).
