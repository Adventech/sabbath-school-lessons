> “In the same way, the Son of Man did not come to be served. He came to serve. The Son of Man came to give his life to save many people” (Mark 10:45, ICB).

This week, we study Mark 10. In this chapter, Jesus finishes teaching His followers about His coming death on the cross. Half of the chapter is about the followers. The other half contains important lessons for Jesus’ followers. We learn these lessons from Jesus’ meetings with people. The Pharisees, a group of Jewish spiritual leaders, come to argue with Jesus about the topic of divorce. Parents bring their children to Jesus for Him to bless. A rich man asks Jesus about everlasting life. A blind man asks Jesus to heal him.

Mark 10 has important lessons about following Jesus and how we do that in everyday life. Mark talks about marriage, children, money, and the reward and cost of following Jesus. Jesus also heals another blind man (Mark 10:46–52; compare with Mark 8:22–26). Mark also gives us a beautiful example of what following Jesus costs us and what our following Him leads to (Mark 10:17–45).

These lessons help the followers of Jesus to become better followers. These lessons are not only for the followers 2,000 years ago. These lessons are also for us today.
