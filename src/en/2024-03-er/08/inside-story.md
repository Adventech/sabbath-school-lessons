### Part 5: A Home That Became a Church

_by Andrew McChesney_

Father kept his promise. He held Sabbath worship at home where he lived in Armenia. The week before, Father told Mother and their daughter Anush that they couldn’t go to the Adventist church anymore. So, on Sabbath morning, Father told his wife and daughter to come to the living room. For Sabbath School, they studied the Adult Sabbath School Bible Study Guide and prayed. Then Anush preached a short sermon.

The family continued to worship every Sabbath at home for many months. Father never visited an Adventist church before. But he was a loyal Sabbath keeper. If guests came to visit, Father invited them to the living room. He opened his Bible, and said, “Welcome to our worship program in our home. Today is the Sabbath. You may join us.” Father’s invitation surprised his guests. They wondered what was going on. That’s because in Armenia, when someone has guests in his home, he puts his guests first. He stops everything to please his guests.

In Matthew 4, the family read about how Jesus won the fight against Satan with the words, “The Bible says.” Father understood that he needed to know the Bible so that he would know when Satan was trying to get him to sin. From that day, Father started to read the Bible daily. As he read, he also found answers to his questions. He learned why he and his family worshiped on the seventh day, Saturday, while many Christians in Armenia worshiped on the first day of the week, Sunday.

Father promised that Anush and Mother would never attend the Adventist Church again. Father wanted to keep his promise. Anush very much missed church services. But she hid her feelings from Father. She understood that it was her duty to love her father and wait for God to give him a new heart.

Then Anush learned that the Adventist house church in their town was going to celebrate the Lord’s Supper and wash each other’s feet on Sabbath. Anush asked her Father for permission to go. In Armenia, fathers make the decisions for their family members.

Father said, “The Lord’s Supper? You know, I can lead out in that part of worship, too.” No one went to the house church that Sabbath. Then Father and Mother became grandparents. Anush’s sister had a baby. Mother learned that the members of the Adventist home church were praying for them and the new baby. Mother told Father, “They prayed for our whole family in church. I want to take something sweet to them as a thank-you gift.”

Father’s heart was touched when he heard about the thoughtfulness of the church members. So, he allowed Anush and Mother to go back to church.
