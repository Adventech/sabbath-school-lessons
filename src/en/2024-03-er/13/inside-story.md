### A Church Built on Trash

_by Andrew McChesney_

Purna had a difficult task. He volunteered to start a church in an important city in South Asia. The city had no churches. Purna was excited, but he didn’t know where to start. How could he share his love for Jesus with his non-Christian neighbors? He prayed, “God, please help.”

Purna prayed for a week. But he still didn’t know where to start. He did know one thing. He couldn’t stand the smell on the road outside his house. Piles of trash sat in dirty puddles of rainwater on the road. The trash blocked the flow of water into the gutters along the street. The dirty water flowed over the gutters and flooded the road. Purna decided to do something about it. He took a long pole made from bamboo wood. Purna used the bamboo pole to pick up the trash from the gutters and drains.

As Purna worked, the neighbors watched him.

A neigbhor asked Purna, “Did the city government send you to clean the road?”

Purna said that the government did not hire him to clean the road. He was cleaning the road because he lived on it. The neighbors were amazed. Nobody cleaned the road before. A neighbor told Purna, “You’re a good man. We need you here.”

Another neighbor agreed. “Yes. We need you. Don’t leave.”

As he cleaned the road, Purna became famous in the town. Everyone knew him and talked about him. People invited him into their homes.

As he met the neighbors, he learned that one man was paralyzed on his left side. So, he couldn’t move his arm or leg on that side of his body. Purna offered to help. He was trained in massage. Massage is the action of rubbing and pressing a person’s body with your hands to heal pain in the muscles and other parts of the body. Purna started to rub the left side of the man’s body. Every time they met, Purna prayed and gave the man a massage. Soon, the man was fully healed.

Neighbors were amazed to see the man in good health.

They asked him, “Who healed you?”

The man said, “Oh, it was the good man who cleans our road!”

Then the neighbors really wanted to get to know Purna. Soon, they started to ask Purna for prayers and massages, too.

Purna has done what no one thought was possible. He started a church. 11 people got baptized. 20 other people are studying the Bible. Purna said, “Please pray for God to help us serve Him more and more. Today, I continue to clean the road.”

Purna lives in a country that we can’t name so that we may protect his work from people who often hate Christians. Learn more about Adventist Mission volunteers at bit.ly/GMPioneers.
