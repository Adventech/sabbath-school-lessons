### Read for This Week’s Lesson
Mark 15:42–16:6; Mark 16:1–8; 1 Corinthians 15:1–8; Mark 16:9–20; Mark 16:14–20.

> <p>Memory Verse</p>
> “But the man said, ‘Don’t be afraid. You are looking for Jesus from Nazareth, the one who was killed on a cross. He has risen [woke up] from death! He is not here. Look, here is the place they put him when he was dead’ ” (Mark 16:6, ERV).

Jesus’ death on the cross caused His followers to lose hope and faith. During this dark time, the followers of Jesus feared for their own lives, too (John 20:19).

Mark 16 is the final chapter in the book of Mark. In this chapter, we will study what happened after Jesus died.

First, we will look at the time that Jesus woke up from the dead. Also, we will learn why the women came to His grave that Sunday morning. Many Christians use the Resurrection morning to support keeping Sunday holy. So, Seventh-day Adventists often avoid talking too much about Resurrection morning. The Resurrection was the time when Jesus woke up from the dead. But we will see why we should be happy about the Sunday Resurrection, even if many Christians use it to teach false ideas about the Sabbath.

Second, we will study on Monday and Tuesday the ideas in the first verses of Mark 16.

Third, on Wednesday and Thursday, we will look at the rest of Mark 16. Our study ends with an invitation to the reader to share the Good News about Jesus everywhere.
