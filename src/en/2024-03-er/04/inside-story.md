### Part 1: A Fight About the Sabbath

_by Andrew McChesney_

Father wasn’t worried when Mother attended Seventh-day Adventist meetings at their town’s schoolhouse in Armenia. Father also wasn’t worried when Mother got baptized.

Father wasn’t worried when his daughter Anush and her sister started going to Adventist summer camps. Father often drove his daughters to camp.

Father wasn’t worried, later on, when Anush decided to get baptized. She was a 17-year-old university student at the time. Father also wasn’t worried when Anush wanted to join the Adventist Church.

But Father was angry when someone from the university 
called to complain about Anush not going to classes on Sabbath.

A university leader told Father, “If Anush doesn’t want to go to class because of the Sabbath, she doesn’t need to go. But why does she need to tell everyone about her reasons for not going? She is causing people to lose respect for our school.”

Father was upset. He thought that Anush’s faith made his family look bad. Father scolded Anush when she came home.

Father said, “Why did you have to announce your reasons for not going to class at the university? If you are going to behave this way, then I forbid you to go to church.”

Father also refused to allow Anush to get baptized.

Father told Anush, “When you’re older, you can make your own decisions. But for now I’m in charge of you.”

Anush didn’t argue. In Armenia, a father’s word is law. But Anush wondered, Was there a way she could go to church and honor Father at the same time? Anush promised God she would get baptized. But she worried that if she got baptized, Father would not allow Mother to go to church. Mother suggested that Anush wait. Mother found support for a delay in Numbers 30:3–5. These verses talk about the daughter who makes a promise or an oath while she lives in her father’s house. If her father approves of the promise, God accepts it. But if the daughter makes a promise that her father doesn’t like, then God releases the daughter from her promise.

Mother told Anush, “I think God supports the decision to wait to get baptized.”

Anush waited. The next four years at university where hard for her. Anush believed that Father was a good man who wanted only what was best for her. But Anush also wanted to attend church and get baptized. Anush was happy when a classmate got baptized. The classmate first learned about the Sabbath when Anush refused to go to class on that day. This classmate became the first person that Anush won for Jesus.
