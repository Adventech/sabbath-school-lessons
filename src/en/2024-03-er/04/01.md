> <p>Memory Verse</p>
> “Think carefully about the things you hear. The way you give to others [people] is the [same]way God will give to you. But God will give you more than you give. The person who has something will be given more. But the person who does not have much, even what he has will be taken [removed] from him” (Mark 4:24, 25, ICB).

This week’s lesson is about the picture stories in Mark 4.

Bible thinkers have argued over the meaning of Jesus’ picture stories. How should we explain their meaning? What do His picture stories mean? Why did Jesus use picture stories? What lessons do they teach us? Should we understand them as symbols or word pictures? Or were the picture stories real stories?

For sure, we won’t answer all these questions in this week’s lesson. We will read the picture stories and try to understand the important ideas Jesus wanted to teach.

Mark 4 tells five picture stories: (1) the farmer, (2) the lamp, (3) the measuring basket, (4) the growing seed, and (5) the mustard seed. Most of Mark 4 talks about the ­farmer. Mark tells us this picture story first. Next, Mark gives us the reason that Jesus told picture stories. Then, Mark tells us what the story means. We will study this three-part plan for Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday. We will study the other stories on Wednesday and Thursday.
