### Part 3: Praying for Father to Be Saved

_by Andrew McChesney_

During the time that Anush was a university student, she watched a film about a Mexican boy. The little boy prayed for his father to give his heart to Jesus. The boy said, “I believe that if I pray for my father every day, he will accept God.”

The story filled Anush with hope. She decided to pray every day for Father to get baptized. She started praying four years before her own baptism. Two years after her baptism, she continued to pray for him. She was sure that Father would give his heart to God. But then Anush started to have trouble at home with Father. So, she wondered how much longer she’d need to wait for her prayers to be answered.

After Anush was baptized, she started to do a lot of work for the Seventh-day Adventist Church. She also volunteered for many of the church’s programs. Sometimes she got paid for her work. Other times, Anush didn’t get paid any money.

At first, Father didn’t complain because he gave Anush permission to go to church and get baptized. In Armenia, many fathers make the decisions for their families.

But Father wanted the best for his daughter. He didn’t understand why she worked so hard for so little money. Father told Anush, “The church is using you. You have good skills. The church is not giving you what they owe you.”

Father continued to complain about the church whenever Anush was at home. She didn’t like it. Whenever she was asked to help out in a church program, Anush asked Father for permission. Father allowed her to go but complained every time.

Anush decided to have a heart-to-heart talk with God. She prayed, “God, I know that Father will come to you. But I’m so tired of all his complaining. Please help me.”

Anush told Mother, “Today, I’m praying with all my heart to God. Join me. We don’t want Father to keep complaining. We want Father to go to church with us.”

In Armenia, many mothers and children go to church without their husbands and fathers. Many families are fine with doing things this way as long as the men allow the mothers and children to go and do not hurt them for their faith. But Anush was no longer happy with going to church without Father. She wanted Father to go to church, too.

Mother agreed to pray. Anush’s heart filled with hope again. She was sure that God would touch Father’s heart. Anush believed Father would give his heart to God at any time.
