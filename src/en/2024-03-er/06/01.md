This week, we study Mark 7 and the first half of Mark 8. At the beginning of Mark 7, Jesus makes the Jewish spiritual leaders angry because He rejects their false religious ideas and teachings. Jesus rejects these things in a way that shows He supports something very important to Christian life today. We will learn what that is this week.

Then Jesus tells a riddle. This riddle helps people understand true faith.

After these things, Jesus goes to Tyre and Sidon. There He meets a woman who is the only person in the Books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John to argue with Jesus and win! Jesus gives her what she asks for because of her faith.

Mark 7 teaches us an important lesson about miracles. Miracles are very wonderful. But they alone are not enough to open hearts to Bible truth. Just look at Israel’s spiritual leaders. What good did Jesus’ miracles do for them, right? They rejected Jesus.

In Mark 8, we will look at how bread is a symbol for human teachings and rules. The stories this week contain important lessons about religious life and worship.
