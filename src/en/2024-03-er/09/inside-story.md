### Part 6: Father’s Special Dream

_by Andrew McChesney_

Anush prayed for years for Father to come to God. After Father allowed Anush and Mother to start attending church again on Sabbaths, Anush asked God to show Himself to Father. Anush prayed, “Please talk to Father in dreams and visions. Or use his friends. I just want You to save him.”

Anush trusted God to solve her problem. She prayed, “This problem is between You and my father.”

Then Father had a dream. In it, he saw fire falling on a city near their town in Armenia. Father saw some people running and screaming. Other people were calm and peaceful. They sang. Father was surprised. He told Anush and Mother about the dream.

About the same time, Anush watched an online sermon about the Holy Spirit. Anush told Father, “The preacher said the fire of the Holy Spirit protects us from the fire of hell. When you get the fire of the Holy Spirit, you won’t be afraid of the fire at the end of earth’s history.”

Anush’s words helped Father understand something about his dream. The scared people in his dream didn’t have the Holy Spirit. They were afraid of hellfire. The peaceful people weren’t afraid because they accepted the fire from the Holy Spirit. Father remembered reading that the Holy Spirit filled Jesus when He was baptized (Matthew 3:16).

Father said, “I need to get baptized.”

But the words sounded strange to Father as he said them. Armenians are filled with pride because they were the first country to become Christian, in 301 a.d. Many Armenians feel it is their duty to be Christian. They were baptized as babies, not as adults. Now, Father wasn’t sure what to do.

Anush said, “You have the Bible. Read it. Let the Bible answer your questions and lead you to the right church.”

Father read the Bible even more carefully. A friend asked him why he read the Bible so much. The friend asked, “Is that something to brag about? If Jesus came tomorrow, would you say, ‘I have read the Bible?’ Is that enough to be saved?”

The questions surprised Father. His whole body shook. A short time later, when he left the friend’s house and was alone in his car, he told God about his fears. He prayed, “If Jesus came tomorrow, what would I say to Him?”

Father went home and told Mother. “I’ll go to church with you next Sabbath.”

But Father didn’t want to go to the town’s house church, which had only seven members who were all women. He said, “Let’s go to the church in the next town.” After that Sabbath, Father started to worship every week in church.
