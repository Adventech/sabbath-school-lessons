> <p>Memory Verse</p>
> “Then people will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great [mighty] power and glory. The Son of Man will send his angels all around the earth. They will gather [collect] his chosen people from every part of the earth” (Mark 13:26, 27, ICB).

This week’s lesson starts with a very short story about a widow, at the end of Mark 12. Jesus uses this story to teach a powerful lesson. The rest of our lesson this week is about Mark 13. This chapter talks about what will happen to Jerusalem and its temple in the future and to God’s people during the end times. Matthew 24 and Luke 21 also talk about these topics.

Mark 13 helps us to understand that these future happenings start shortly after the time that Jesus goes back to heaven and end with the Second Coming. So, these special messages are about the past and the future. Also, we must not think these messages are about things faraway in the future that won’t happen for a while.

The Lord’s teaching about end-time happenings is His answer to a question that His followers ask Him. Jesus often uses their questions to teach important Bible truths about things that Christians need to know for their spiritual lives. Jesus talks about what will happen in the future and teaches His followers, then and now, how to get ready for the things that are coming.
