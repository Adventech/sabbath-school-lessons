### Part 7: “Adventists Are Good People”

_by Andrew McChesney_

Anush worked as a planning manager for ADRA (the Adventist Development and Relief Agency) before Father refused to allow her and Mother to worship at the Seventh-day Adventist Church in their town in Armenia. After Father told them they could go back to church, Anush started to work at ADRA again.

Father met many Adventist leaders who came to Armenia and visited ADRA.

When Anush brought guests home, Father saw that they were educated and nice people.

Father told Anush, “Adventists are good people.”

Father got to know the seven women who attended the Adventist house church in his town. Father decided they were good people, too.

Then Anush was accepted at Andrews University in the United States where she would study to get her master’s. ADRA and the church headquarters in Europe and Asia agreed to pay for Anush to go to school. Father’s heart was touched when he heard this news. He wanted only the best for his daughter.

When Anush graduated, she became the manager of ADRA for Armenia. Father watched as she managed a number of special jobs for ADRA. Father’s respect grew for both the Adventist Church and the way Adventists lived. Soon Father removed tobacco and then alcohol from the small grocery shop that he owned.

Then Father got baptized and joined the Adventist Church. He joined 21 years after Mother was baptized and nine years after Anush started to pray for him to accept God.

After his baptism, Father met the friend whose question about reading the Bible surprised him and caused him to start to go to church. Father said, “Did you know that your words changed my life? After you asked me these questions, I really started to read the Bible and follow it. Then I got baptized.”

The friend asked, “What are you talking about?”

Father said, “You asked, ‘If Jesus came tomorrow, would you say, ‘I have read the Bible’? Would that be enough?’ ”

The friend said the conversation never happened. “I never said that,” he said. “I would never judge you like that. You made a mistake.”

At that moment, Father understood that God talked to him through his friend who didn’t remember their conversation.

Part of last quarter’s 13th Sabbath Offering went to open a special center in Yerevan, Armenia. Thanks for helping share the Good News about Jesus with your offerings.
