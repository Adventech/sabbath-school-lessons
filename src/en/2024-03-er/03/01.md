> <p>Memory Verse</p>
> “Then Jesus said to them, ‘The Sabbath day was made for man. Man was not made for the Sabbath day. So the Son of Man is Lord even [also] of the Sabbath day’ ” (Mark 2:27, 28, NIrV).

MARK 2:1–3:6 contains five stories. These stories compare Jesus’ teachings with the teachings of the Jewish leaders. Each story in Mark 2:1–3:6 is connected to the topic of the story that comes before it. The final story is connected to the first story.

Each one of the five stories in Mark 2:1–3:6 teaches us something important about Jesus (read Mark 2:10, 17, 20, 28). Jesus says many wise things in these stories. On Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, we will learn more about these stories and the meaning of Jesus’ wise sayings.

On Wednesday and Thursday, we will study Mark 3:20–35.

Mark uses a special form or style of storytelling to tell his stories. This form of storytelling is named “Sandwich Story.” (You can learn more about Sandwich Stories on Wednesday.) Mark uses the Sandwich Stories style of Story­telling at least six times in his book. In each Sandwich Story, Mark tells us something important about Jesus and His work for us as our Savior.

This week, we will read some of Mark’s stories about Jesus to discover what we may learn about Him.
