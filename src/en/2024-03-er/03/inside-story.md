### Only When People Pray and Stop Eating for a Short Time

_by Andrew McChesney_

14-year-old Payel changed after her friend killed herself. Payel used to be outgoing and friendly. But now she was quiet and didn’t talk to anyone. Then she started to scream, shiver, and shake for no reason. Payel was scared. She told someone that a person who looked the same as her dead friend visited her.

The ghost told Payel, “Come. I want to take you with me.”

Two times Payel tried to jump off the balcony of her home. Payel’s parents were very worried about their daughter. They called Rustam for help. Rustam was a Bible worker with Global Mission.

Rustam took four church workers to Payel’s home to pray. But Payel wouldn’t sit still. She screamed. She threw her hands up and down and stomped her feet. The church workers sang hymns. Every time they said the name of Jesus, Payel screamed, “Stop! I can’t breathe. Someone is choking me!” Rustam understood that Payel was filled with an evil spirit. Rustam read from the Bible stories about Jesus commanding demons to come out of people. Rustam prayed. Then Payel became calm. But later that night, Payel’s aunt called Rustam and said, “Payel is screaming again and says she sees her friend.”

Rustam was confused. What did he do wrong? Then he remembered the Bible story about how Jesus’ followers couldn’t cast out a spirit. When the followers asked Jesus why, Jesus said, “ ‘But this kind [type] of bad spirit does not come out of a person unless people ask God and fast [do not eat food for a time]’ ” (Matthew 17:21, WE). Rustam called several other Global Mission workers. They fasted and prayed for two days. Then Rustam went back to Payel’s house with a group that included an Adventist pastor.

When Payel saw the visitors, she tried to run away. Four people were needed to hold Payel down. She screamed as the visitors sang hymns for 30 minutes. Then Payel fell asleep while the pastor preached about Jesus. Rustam sprinkled drops of water on her face. Then she woke up and drank some water.

Since then, Rustam has visited Payel and her family every two weeks to pray with them. Payel is outgoing and friendly again. Rustam says, “We weren’t ready the first time we visited Payel. We were ready the second time because of Jesus’ words in Matthew 17:21.”

Thank you for your prayers for Global Mission workers who are starting churches in places where no one knows about Jesus. Learn more on the website: https://bit.ly/GMPioneers.
