> “He said, ‘Abba, Father! You can do all things. Don’t make me drink from this cup. But do what you want, not what I want’ ” (Mark 14:36, ERV).

Mark 14–16 talks about Jesus’ suffering, death, and resurrection. The resurrection is the time when Jesus woke up from the dead. As we learned in lesson 9, the last six chapters in Mark talk about only one week. Most of the things in Mark 14–16 happen on Thursday and Friday of this final week before Jesus dies on the cross. Jesus dies on Friday. He wakes up from the dead on Sunday.

This week, we will study Mark 14. We will look at two different things that Jesus does. Then we will look at the Last Supper and Jesus’ suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane. Jesus is arrested in Gethsemane. Then the soldiers take Jesus to the Jewish leaders for a trial. During this time, Peter says that he doesn’t know Jesus.

As we read the story in Mark 14, we see that another story happens at the same time. Mark shows us how the people in these two stories don’t get along and their plans don’t agree. So, the people fight against each other. Mark also shows us that, in the end, Jesus will win the fight against His enemies.
