### Part 8: A Dream About Tofu

_by Andrew McChesney_

Father started to get sharp pains in his belly. Mother and Anush decided to pay careful attention to Father’s diet. Anush didn’t eat any meat. Mother was a scientist. She knew which foods were good for you. But Mother had not fed her family the most healthful foods. Mother and Anush started to feed Father meals made mostly from plants. Father’s stomach aches went away.

Then Father had another dream. He saw a bright light in the garage. The light was so bright. Father couldn’t look at it. A voice said from the light, “Don’t be afraid. Come. Take this bucket with seeds. Plant the seeds on this table.”

Father saw a bucket of seeds next to a steel table. But Father didn’t understand why the voice commanded him to do something so strange. When Father studied at the university, he trained to be a crop scientist. So, he knew about plants. But even a child knew that seeds couldn’t sprout from steel! Father said, “Seeds must be planted in the ground to grow.” But the voice commanded, “Do as I say.” So, Father obeyed.

In the dream, a day passed. Then Father saw healthy, 3-inch plants growing from the table! Father was amazed. He asked, “How can seeds grow in one night and on this steel table?”

The voice commanded, “Pull up the plants and sell them.”

Father told the dream to his family. As Anush listened, she wondered if God was telling Father to make tofu. Tofu is a food made from soybean plants. Tofu is used as a substitute for meat. No company in Armenia made tofu.

Then Anush went to a meeting in Ukraine, in 2019. The 300 people at the meeting got excited when they heard about Father’s dream. At the time, Adventists in Ukraine had many companies and health-food stores that made and sold tofu. When the meeting manager asked the people at the meeting who would teach Father to make tofu, everyone volunteered.

Two months later, Father bought plane tickets to Ukraine. He and Mother left home without knowing exactly what was going to happen, the same as Abraham and Sarah. God took care of everything. Church workers met them at the airport. Father and Mother stayed with the workers during the time they visited health-food stores and tofu companies for 12 days. Father saw Christians could work both for money and God’s glory. When he came home, he opened Armenia’s first tofu company. Anush was so happy! She could hardly believe that Father had used her meat-free diet as a reason to prevent her from going to church. Now he was selling tofu and telling people to eat a healthful diet!
