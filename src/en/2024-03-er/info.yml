  title: "The Book of Mark"
  description: "The Book of Mark tells the story about Jesus’ life and His work on earth. From the beginning of the Book of Mark, the reader knows who Jesus is. Jesus is the promised Savior, the Son of God (Mark 1:1). But the people in the story have a hard time understanding who Jesus is and what He came to earth to do. Everyone in the Book of Mark has a hard time understanding, except for the people filled with demons. The demons are afraid of Jesus and His mighty words. The demons know exactly who Jesus is!"
