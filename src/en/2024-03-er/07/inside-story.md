### Part 4: A Big Disagreement Over Food

_by Andrew McChesney_

One Sabbath, Anush and Mother came home from church. Anush learned that Father made plans for a picnic in the country. He told them, “Let’s barbecue.”

Anush said, “No Father. That’s not a good plan. I don’t eat meat anymore.”

Father decided not to go on the picnic. But he didn’t really understand that Anush gave up eating meat for good. The next day, Father made chicken for Sunday lunch. He offered her a piece. Anush said, “Father, I don’t eat any meat.” Now Father understood. He got upset. He thought that eating no meat was not normal.

The next day, Father told Anush and her mother that they couldn’t go to prayer meeting at the house church in their town. When Mother and Anush got upset, Father got angry. He complained about Adventists. He didn’t like that they gave God tithe or 10% of all the money they got (Malachi 3:8–10). If that wasn’t bad enough, they gave God offerings, too. Father blamed the Adventist Church for being a foreign group that wanted to destroy Armenia. Father said bad things about the way that Anush lived. Father said, “Today you say, ‘I don’t eat meat.’ Tomorrow you will say, ‘I don’t have a father.’ ”

Anush sat quietly and prayed in her heart. She said, “What shall I say, Lord?” Every time Father spoke against God or the church, she prayed, “Father is not really saying these things to me. He’s saying them to You. It’s your job to answer.” Then Anush remembered Romans 2:4, which says, “God is kind to you so that you will change your hearts and lives” (ICB). Anush believed that God was telling her to show the same love to her father. Anush prayed, “Help me to love him. Amen.”

Father owned a small grocery store. When Father left Mother or Anush in charge, they didn’t sell alcohol or cigarettes. Now, as Father scolded them, he felt guilty. He said, “Do you think that I’m evil and you’re good because I sell alcohol and cigarettes, and you don’t? I’m a better Christian than you both! To prove it, I will lead Sabbath worship from now on. So, you no longer need to go to church.”

That announcement ended the conversation. Anush went to her room. Mother followed. Both were surprised. Mother said, “What will we do now?”

Anush suggested that they cooperate with Father as long as he honored the Bible. Anush said, “Father said we will worship at home on Sabbath. He didn’t take away our Bibles. He also respects the Sabbath. Let’s wait for Sabbath. If Father keeps his promise, we will keep the Sabbath at home with him. If he breaks his promise, we will pray and let the Lord lead us.”
