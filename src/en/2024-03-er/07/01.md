> “Then Jesus called the crowd to him, along with his followers. He said, ‘If anyone wants to follow me, he must say “no” to the things he wants. He must be willing to die on a cross, and he must follow me’ ” (Mark 8:34, ICB).

The first half of the book of Mark shows us who Jesus is. His powerful teachings and miracles help us to understand that He is the Savior.

At the beginning of the second half of the Book of Mark, Jesus asks His followers who they believe He is. After Peter answers, Jesus starts to explain what will happen to Him as the Savior.

In the last part of Mark 8 to the end of Mark 10, Jesus teaches His followers about what will happen to Him. Jesus talks about the Cross. Then He teaches His followers special lessons. These lessons are important for us today.

Jesus also heals two different blind men. Jesus heals one blind man in the middle of Mark 8 and the other blind man at the end of Mark 10. These miracles teach us about following Jesus. When we follow Jesus, God will give us more spiritual wisdom about Jesus and who He is. Jesus’ teachings helped His followers become better people. His teachings continue to help us today, too. They show us what we will need to do to follow Jesus and the blessings that God will give us when we do.
