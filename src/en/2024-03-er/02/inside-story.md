### Part 2: Confused Witch Doctor

_by Andrew McChesney_

Father rested for several days at the house of his daughter, Divya, in Nepal. Father was tired from his two jobs. He worked as a builder and a witch doctor.

Father watched with interest when the Seventh-day Adventist pastor of Divya’s church came to visit and brought several church members with him. Father listened as they sang songs about his daughter’s new God, Jesus.

Then the pastor opened a Bible and read Jesus’ invitation: “ ‘Come to me, all you who are tired and are carrying heavy loads. I will give you rest’ ” (Matthew 11:28, NIrV). Next, the pastor read Jesus’ words in John 3:16: “ ‘Yes, God loved the world [everyone on the earth] so much that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him would not be lost but have eternal [everlasting] life’ ” (ERV).

The verses touched Father’s heart. Father never heard of a God who gave His only Son to save people. Father now understood that we don’t need to kill animals and offer them to God to get His blessings. God sent His Son as the offering for our sin.

After the pastor left, Father asked Divya for a Bible. Father wanted to read the two verses for himself. But when he looked in the Bible, he couldn’t find them. Divya also couldn’t find them. So, she called the pastor. The pastor told them where to find the verses in the Bible. Father was so happy. He started to read the Bible daily. On Sabbath, Father went to church with Divya and his wife. God healed his wife after Divya prayed. At first, Father didn’t understand anything at church or in the Bible. But he took the Bible when he left Mother with Divya and went home to his own town a short time later.

At home, Father continued his work as a witch doctor and builder during the day. At night, he read the Bible. As the months passed, he no longer wanted to pray to spirits. Father decided to stop working as a witch doctor. He told the townspeople, “My life is different. I don’t want to be a witch doctor anymore.”

The townspeople were angry when they learned that Father became a Christian. The townspeople accused Father of not being loyal to the spirits of his dead family members, who had been witch doctors. Father didn’t care that the townspeople were mad at him. He was sure that he found the one and only God.

Today, Father and Mother are members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church where they serve the Lord. Father’s name is Krishna Lama. He is 66 years old and is a church leader.

Krishna says, “I used to think that my home was where the spirits of my dead family members lived. But now I believe that the church is my home. With Jesus, my future is the same as a bright light.”
