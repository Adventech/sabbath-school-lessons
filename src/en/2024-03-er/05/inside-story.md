### Part 2: An Unexpected Change of Heart

_by Andrew McChesney_

When Anush graduated university, no one offered her work.Father was very worried. In Armenia, fathers often help their kids get jobs. Some fathers pay companies to give jobs to their children. But Father refused to pay a company to hire his daughter. So, Anush had no job in her town in Armenia.

Then Anush learned about a group of churches from the United States. This group was looking for someone who spoke the Armenian language to translate for them. The job paid a small amount of money. Anush needed to move to a nearby city, Vanadzor, to do the job. Anush asked Father for permission to work for the Christian group. In Armenia, children ask their parents for permission to do many things. Father thought that working with Americans would be a good experience for Anush. He told her, “Yes, you may go.”

Anush got the job. She was happy. Four years earlier, Father forbade Anush to go to church or get baptized. Now Anush read the Bible and shared Jesus with other people. She also got paid to do it! As Anush worked, she wanted to become a missionary. A missionary is someone who travels to faraway lands to tell other people about Jesus. When her job ended, Anush came home. She wondered how she could become a missionary.

Anush prayed and fasted for three days. When people fast, they don’t eat food for a short time. While she fasted, Anush read in Exodus that God told Moses at the burning bush to ask Pharaoh to let His people go serve Him. Anush felt that God said to her, “Go ask Father to let you serve Me.”

Anush went to Father. She asked, “May I go study to become a missionary in another country?” Father said, “No.”

Anush kept reading Exodus. God continued to send Moses to Pharoah. Every time Moses talked to Pharoah, Anush spoke to Father. Father got upset. One day, he shouted at Anush. He said, “Why can’t you just go to the local church and get baptized? Forget about becoming a missionary in another country!”

Anush was confused. She hadn’t expected Father to agree to her baptism. So, she decided to go to church. She went to a nearby city where an Adventist church held meetings about Jesus. When the preacher asked who wanted to be baptized, Anush stood.

The preacher asked, “Are you sure? What about your father?”

Everyone knew Anush’s story. Anush said, “Father is fine with my decision.” Father didn’t stop the baptism. With joy, Anush got baptized.
