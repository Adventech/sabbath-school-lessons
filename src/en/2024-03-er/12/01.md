Mark 15 tells the story of Jesus’ court trial and death sentence. Also in Mark 15, we read about the soldiers who make fun of Jesus. Then Jesus is nailed to the cross. He dies and is buried.

In Mark 15, things happen in a way that is different from what you may expect. Writers give a special name to this type of experience: irony. Because irony is an important part of Mark 15, we need to know more about it.

Irony often has three parts: (1) when an experience or word in a story has two different meanings, we say that the experience or word is filled with irony. (2) The two different meanings don’t agree with each other. And (3) someone in the story doesn’t see the irony or different meanings. This person doesn’t understand what’s going on around him. So, he doesn’t know that he will suffer.

This week, Mark writes about many painful experiences that also are filled with irony: Pilate’s question to Jesus, the laughing soldiers, the sign above the cross, the mean and nasty Jewish leaders who make fun of Jesus when He is dying. All these painful experiences show us power­ful Bible truths about Jesus and what His death means for us.
