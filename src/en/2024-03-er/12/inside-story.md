### Part 9: Bringing Armenia to Jesus

_by Andrew McChesney_

While Anush prayed for her father, she also prayed for the 4,000 people who lived in her town in Armenia. Then God started to touch hearts.

After her baptism, Anush met with two other young women to pray for the town. Then they invited people to special meetings. Several dozen young people came. After that, the Adventist Church in Euro-Asia helped Anush and her friends rent buses. They took groups of 50 young people on trips around Armenia. At every stop along the way, church members greeted the young people. Anush saw the young people become excited about Bible truth. They started asking questions about God.

Interest in the Adventist message grew. Then a pastor started to visit Anush’s town every other Sunday to hold meetings. At the meetings, the pastor talked about relationships, money, and other topics. Many people came to the meetings over two years.

People in the town respected Father. So, when he became a Seventh-day Adventist, the whole town talked about his faith. Father went to a church that wasn’t the state religion of Armenia. His baptism helped other people to want to know more about God. The town’s church grew from seven women in a private home to a rented hall where dozens of people meet every Sabbath. Church members meet with other people online to pray daily. The members plan to buy their own church building.

Father’s name is Armen Safaryan. His wife’s name is Gayane Badalyan. Today, they work with their daughter Anush Safaryan to make tofu at their company. As we saw last week, tofu is a food product made from a special bean named the soybean. Tofu is used as a meat substitute. Father’s company is the only tofu company in Armenia. So, Father’s company has been shown on TV. Many TV reporters ask Father why he makes tofu. So, Father gets invited often to share his faith on TV.

Father is a church leader. Mother is in charge of health work for their local church. Father is an example to other men in a country where many mothers and children go to church without their husbands and fathers. Father, Mother, and Anush want to change that. When church leaders introduce Father at meetings where he gives talks, the leaders say, “See, this normal Armenian man is an Adventist. Men, you are not alone. This man goes to church on Sabbath.”

Anush shares her story at churches and youth camps. She says, “Ask God to touch the hearts of your husbands and fathers. Pray that they will go to church with you.”

Part of last quarter’s 13th Sabbath Offering helped open a special center in Yerevan, Armenia. Thanks for helping share the Good News with your offerings.
