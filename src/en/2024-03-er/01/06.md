Jesus preached the Good News. What are the three parts of His message in Mark 1:14, 15?

Jesus’ message has three parts:

| Part | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 1. A special time message. | The time is now. |
| 2. Promises. | God’s kingdom is near. |
| 3. An invitation to follow Him. | Stop sinning. Believe the Good News. |

What time message is Jesus talking about? Jesus is talking about the 70-week time message in Daniel 9:24–27. Daniel 9:24–27 shows us the time of Jesus’ baptism. The Holy Spirit fills Jesus. Then Jesus starts His work for God (Acts 10:38). The chart below shows us when the 70-week time message will happen in history:

In this time message, one day is a symbol for one year (Numbers 14:34; Ezekiel 4:6). The time message started in 457 b.c., when Artaxerxes, king of Persia, made a law. The law permitted the Jews to go home and rebuild the city of Jerusalem (read Ezra 7).

69 weeks in this special time message continue from 457 b.c. until a.d. 27. At that time, John baptized Jesus. Then the Holy Spirit filled Jesus. When the Spirit filled Jesus, Jesus’ work on earth for God started.

3½ years later, Jesus died on the cross.
