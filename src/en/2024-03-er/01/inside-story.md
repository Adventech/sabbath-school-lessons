### Part 1: Confused Witch Doctor

_by Andrew McChesney_

Father was the most well-known person in his small town in Nepal. Everyone came to Father for healing. Townspeople believed that Father’s magic could heal any disease. Father came from a family of witch doctors. Father became a witch doctor after the death of his father, who was also a witch doctor.

Father killed animals and gave their blood as gifts to the spirits. In exchange, Father asked the spirits to heal people. Father believed the spirits respected his gifts. So, he was confused when he couldn’t heal the person he loved most: his wife. Father killed a chicken and offered its blood to the spirits and asked them to heal his wife. But her pain didn’t go away. Father didn’t know what was making her sick. So, Father gave money to another witch doctor. But Mother lost weight. Then Father took her to a medical doctor. But Mother continued to get weak.

Father was confused. He became more confused after his grown daughter, Divya, came home to help mother. Father came home and couldn’t find Mother or Divya. Father searched the house. Finally, Father found them in an upstairs room. Mother and Divya were kneeling on the floor. They also were talking to someone he couldn’t see. Father left the room quietly without bothering them. Father wondered if his daughter also was a witch doctor. When Father saw Divya later, he asked her what she and Mother were doing.

Divya said, “We were praying to my God to heal Mother.”

Father asked, “Which God?” Father prayed to many gods.

Divya said, “To my God, Jesus. I left our family religion. I found a new God in Jesus.” Divya explained that Jesus made the skies and the earth. “If I pray, He will hear and heal Mother,” she said. Father didn’t understand how this God could be more powerful than any of the family gods.

Divya lived in another town. When she needed to go back home, she asked Father for permission to take Mother with her. Divya said, “Mother is sick. You don’t have time to take care of her because you are working. Let me take her with me.”

Father worked hard as both a witch doctor and a builder. So, he didn’t have time to take care of Mother. He didn’t think Mother would live much longer. So, he let Divya take her.

Six months passed before Father saw Mother again. Father traveled to Divya’s house. He was surprised to see Mother was healthy. Father was filled with questions. He asked Divya, “Why is Mother well? What medicine did you give her?”

Divya said that she prayed only to God. “God heard my prayer. Now Mother is well. She goes to church with me.”

Father didn’t believe it. He laughed. He never heard of a God who healed people without payment or an animal gift.
