> “The apostles [leaders and teachers] were doing many miracles and signs [works that were proof of God’s power]. And everyone felt great [much; a lot of] respect for God” (Acts 2:43, ICB).

PEACE happens in the church when members know Jesus. Jesus is the Truth (John 14:6). When church members know Jesus, then they also build strong friendships with each other. That is exactly what happened with the first Adventists. Their experience in Jesus joined their hearts as one. Their friendships helped them stay strong in the Lord when they tried to understand why Jesus did not come back in 1844. That experience started the Seventh-day Adventist Church. It also helped Adventists learn that before Jesus comes back again, He will judge everyone who lived on the earth.

After Jesus went to heaven, His followers prayed and studied the Bible together. Their experience shows us God’s power in their lives. Their experience also led to peace and agreement between people who were very different from each other. We can have that same experience today.

“Jesus first brings a person to Himself. But then He always joins that person to other believers in His ‘body.’ Jesus’ ‘body’ is a word picture for His church.”—Robert G. Rayburn, O Come, Let Us Worship (Grand Rapids: Baker Book House, 1980), page 91, adapted.
