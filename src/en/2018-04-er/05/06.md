The new believers shared all that they owned with each other. Their loving spirit showed the agreement and peace that lived in the New Testament church. But the sharing found in the first chapter of Acts did not end there. Later on, Paul invited the churches he started in Macedonia and Achaia to collect money for the poor in Jerusalem (read Acts 11:27–30; Galatians 2:10; Romans 15:26; and 1 Corinthians 16:1–4). Most of the members in those churches were not Jewish. Their gift of money shows us how much the non-Jewish believers loved and cared for their Jewish brothers and sisters in Jerusalem. Yes, the Jewish and non-Jewish believers were different in many ways. They had different ways of life and came from different race groups and countries. But even so, they all joined together as one “body” of believers in Jesus. They all loved and believed in the same message: the Good News about Jesus. When the non-Jewish churches shared with the poor Jewish members in Jerusalem, they showed unity. Unity is agreement in mind, heart, and belief in Jesus.

`In 2 Corinthians 9:8–15, Paul tells us that the church at Corinth is very giving. What good things does Paul say will happen because of their unselfish hearts?`

The unity that the church had in Paul’s day shows us what we can do today. But unity does not happen on its own. All believers must be willing to help someone every day.

What spiritual things in the New Testament church made unity possible? The answer is prayer, worship, Christian friendship, a shared purpose or plan, and Bible study. The new believers also understood that they were responsible for loving and caring for each other. Their agreement in these things led them to take care of members in their own church and the needs of members who were far away.

“The giving spirit in the New Testament church showed that God gave them His loving-favor and that they were putting His gift to good use. What caused the church to share and give so much? It was the Holy Spirit who made their hearts holy and loving. Both believers and people who did not believe saw the loving behavior of the New Testament church. In everyone’s eyes, the behavior of the new believers was a miracle from God.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles [leaders], page 344, adapted.
