In the Old Testament, God told Moses to build Him a sanctuary on earth (Exodus 25:8). The sanctuary on earth was the place where people worshiped God until Solomon built God a temple (1 Kings 5–8). God used the sanctuary to teach His people about His plan to save them. Both the sanctuary and Solomon’s temple were copies of the sanctuary in heaven (Hebrews 8:2; read also Exodus 25:9, 40).

The whole Bible hints at and teaches that there is a real sanctuary in heaven. The sanctuary in heaven is the place where God lives. The sanctuary on earth showed God’s people His plan to save humans and helped explain Jesus’ work in heaven as our High Priest. A high priest is a holy leader who works to save His people.

`Hebrews 8:6; Hebrews 9:11, 12, 23–28; and 1 John 1:9– 2:2 talk about Jesus’ work as our High Priest in heaven’s sanctuary. What do these verses teach us about Jesus’ special work?`

After Jesus woke up from the dead and went to heaven, He entered the sanctuary. There, He started His work to save us (Hebrews 7:25). That is why the Bible tells us we can “go with complete [full] trust to the throne of God. We will receive [get] His loving-kindness and have His loving-favor to help us whenever we need it” (Hebrews 4:16, NLV).

The high priest’s work in the sanctuary on earth had two parts. In the same way, Jesus’ work as our High Priest has two parts too. Jesus stands between sinners and a holy God. He works to end the separation that sin caused between us and God the Father. He works to connect humans to God again. Humans who turn away from sinning can connect with the Father right away. Jesus makes that connection possible (1 John 2:1). Since 1844, Jesus now works for us in the Most Holy Room in heaven’s sanctuary. His work includes judging and making God’s people clean. That work was done one time every year on the Day of Cleansing in Bible times (Leviticus 16). The high priest made the sanctuary “clean” on that day. His work is a word picture that shows how Jesus’ blood removes sin and joins God and everyone under one peaceful government. Adventists were the first to tell people the truth about Jesus’ special work for humans right now in the two rooms of heaven’s sanctuary.
