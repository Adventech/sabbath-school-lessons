            'Acts 10:1– 11:18': '<h3> <span>Acts 10:1-11:18</span></h3><p><span><span>10&#xA0;</span>There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of what was called the Italian Regiment, </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>a devout <i>man</i> and one who feared God with all his household, who gave alms generously to the people, and prayed to God always. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>About the ninth hour of the day he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God coming in and saying to him, &#x201C;Cornelius!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>And when he observed him, he was afraid, and said, &#x201C;What is it, lord?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>So he said to him, &#x201C;Your prayers and your alms have come up for a memorial before God. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>Now send men to Joppa, and send for Simon whose surname is Peter. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>He is lodging with Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea. He will tell you what you must do.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>And when the angel who spoke to him had departed, Cornelius called two of his household servants and a devout soldier from among those who waited on him continually. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>So when he had explained all <i>these</i> things to them, he sent them to Joppa.</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>The next day, as they went on their journey and drew near the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Then he became very hungry and wanted to eat; but while they made ready, he fell into a trance </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>and saw heaven opened and an object like a great sheet bound at the four corners, descending to him and let down to the earth. </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>In it were all kinds of four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, creeping things, and birds of the air. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>And a voice came to him, <span>&#x201C;Rise, Peter; kill and eat.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>But Peter said, &#x201C;Not so, Lord! For I have never eaten anything common or unclean.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>And a voice <i>spoke</i> to him again the second time, <span>&#x201C;What God has cleansed you must not call common.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>This was done three times. And the object was taken up into heaven again.</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>Now while Peter wondered within himself what this vision which he had seen meant, behold, the men who had been sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon&#x2019;s house, and stood before the gate. </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>And they called and asked whether Simon, whose surname was Peter, was lodging there.</span></p><p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>While Peter thought about the vision, the Spirit said to him, &#x201C;Behold, three men are seeking you. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Arise therefore, go down and go with them, doubting nothing; for I have sent them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>Then Peter went down to the men who had been sent to him from Cornelius, and said, &#x201C;Yes, I am he whom you seek. For what reason have you come?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>And they said, &#x201C;Cornelius <i>the</i> centurion, a just man, one who fears God and has a good reputation among all the nation of the Jews, was divinely instructed by a holy angel to summon you to his house, and to hear words from you.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>Then he invited them in and lodged <i>them.</i></span></p><p><span>On the next day Peter went away with them, and some brethren from Joppa accompanied him.</span></p><p><span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>And the following day they entered Caesarea. Now Cornelius was waiting for them, and had called together his relatives and close friends. </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>As Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshiped <i>him.</i> </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>But Peter lifted him up, saying, &#x201C;Stand up; I myself am also a man.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>And as he talked with him, he went in and found many who had come together. </span> <span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>Then he said to them, &#x201C;You know how unlawful it is for a Jewish man to keep company with or go to one of another nation. But God has shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean. </span> <span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>Therefore I came without objection as soon as I was sent for. I ask, then, for what reason have you sent for me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>So Cornelius said, &#x201C;Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing, </span> <span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>and said, &#x2018;Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your alms are remembered in the sight of God. </span> <span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>Send therefore to Joppa and call Simon here, whose surname is Peter. He is lodging in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea. When he comes, he will speak to you.&#x2019; </span> <span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>So I sent to you immediately, and you have done well to come. Now therefore, we are all present before God, to hear all the things commanded you by God.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>Then Peter opened <i>his</i> mouth and said: &#x201C;In truth I perceive that God shows no partiality. </span> <span><sup>35&#xA0;</sup>But in every nation whoever fears Him and works righteousness is accepted by Him. </span> <span><sup>36&#xA0;</sup>The word which <i>God</i> sent to the children of Israel, preaching peace through Jesus Christ&#x2014;He is Lord of all&#x2014; </span> <span><sup>37&#xA0;</sup>that word you know, which was proclaimed throughout all Judea, and began from Galilee after the baptism which John preached: </span> <span><sup>38&#xA0;</sup>how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him. </span> <span><sup>39&#xA0;</sup>And we are witnesses of all things which He did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem, whom they killed by hanging on a tree. </span> <span><sup>40&#xA0;</sup>Him God raised up on the third day, and showed Him openly, </span> <span><sup>41&#xA0;</sup>not to all the people, but to witnesses chosen before by God, <i>even</i> to us who ate and drank with Him after He arose from the dead. </span> <span><sup>42&#xA0;</sup>And He commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that it is He who was ordained by God <i>to be</i> Judge of the living and the dead. </span> <span><sup>43&#xA0;</sup>To Him all the prophets witness that, through His name, whoever believes in Him will receive remission of sins.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>44&#xA0;</sup>While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who heard the word. </span> <span><sup>45&#xA0;</sup>And those of the circumcision who believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles also. </span> <span><sup>46&#xA0;</sup>For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God.</span></p><p><span>Then Peter answered, </span> <span><sup>47&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Can anyone forbid water, that these should not be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit just as we <i>have?</i>&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>48&#xA0;</sup>And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then they asked him to stay a few days.</span></p><p><span><span>11&#xA0;</span>Now the apostles and brethren who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And when Peter came up to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision contended with him, </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>saying, &#x201C;You went in to uncircumcised men and ate with them!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>But Peter explained <i>it</i> to them in order from the beginning, saying: </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;I was in the city of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision, an object descending like a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came to me. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>When I observed it intently and considered, I saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, creeping things, and birds of the air. </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>And I heard a voice saying to me, <span>&#x2018;Rise, Peter; kill and eat.&#x2019;</span> </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>But I said, &#x2018;Not so, Lord! For nothing common or unclean has at any time entered my mouth.&#x2019; </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>But the voice answered me again from heaven, <span>&#x2018;What God has cleansed you must not call common.&#x2019;</span> </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Now this was done three times, and all were drawn up again into heaven. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>At that very moment, three men stood before the house where I was, having been sent to me from Caesarea. </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Then the Spirit told me to go with them, doubting nothing. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered the man&#x2019;s house. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>And he told us how he had seen an angel standing in his house, who said to him, &#x2018;Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon whose surname is Peter, </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>who will tell you words by which you and all your household will be saved.&#x2019; </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, as upon us at the beginning. </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how He said, <span>&#x2018;John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.&#x2019;</span> </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>If therefore God gave them the same gift as <i>He gave</i> us when we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could withstand God?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>When they heard these things they became silent; and they glorified God, saying, &#x201C;Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance to life.&#x201D;</span></p>'
            'Acts 15:1–5': '<h3> <span>Acts 15:1-5</span></h3><p><span><span>15&#xA0;</span>And certain <i>men</i> came down from Judea and taught the brethren, &#x201C;Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, when Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and dispute with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas and certain others of them should go up to Jerusalem, to the apostles and elders, about this question.</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>So, being sent on their way by the church, they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, describing the conversion of the Gentiles; and they caused great joy to all the brethren. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>And when they had come to Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders; and they reported all things that God had done with them. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>But some of the sect of the Pharisees who believed rose up, saying, &#x201C;It is necessary to circumcise them, and to command <i>them</i> to keep the law of Moses.&#x201D;</span></p>'
            'Acts 11:22': '<h3> <span>Acts 11:22</span></h3><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>Then news of these things came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent out Barnabas to go as far as Antioch. </span> </p>'
            'Acts 21:28': '<h3> <span>Acts 21:28</span></h3><p> <span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>crying out, &#x201C;Men of Israel, help! This is the man who teaches all <i>men</i> everywhere against the people, the law, and this place; and furthermore he also brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place.&#x201D; </span> </p>'
            'Acts 8:14': '<h3> <span>Acts 8:14</span></h3><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them, </span> </p>'
            'Acts 15': '<h3> <span>Acts 15</span></h3><p><span><span>15&#xA0;</span>And certain <i>men</i> came down from Judea and taught the brethren, &#x201C;Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, when Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and dispute with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas and certain others of them should go up to Jerusalem, to the apostles and elders, about this question.</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>So, being sent on their way by the church, they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, describing the conversion of the Gentiles; and they caused great joy to all the brethren. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>And when they had come to Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders; and they reported all things that God had done with them. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>But some of the sect of the Pharisees who believed rose up, saying, &#x201C;It is necessary to circumcise them, and to command <i>them</i> to keep the law of Moses.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>Now the apostles and elders came together to consider this matter. </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>And when there had been much dispute, Peter rose up <i>and</i> said to them: &#x201C;Men <i>and</i> brethren, you know that a good while ago God chose among us, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>So God, who knows the heart, acknowledged them by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as <i>He did</i> to us, </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>and made no distinction between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Now therefore, why do you test God by putting a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved in the same manner as they.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Then all the multitude kept silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul declaring how many miracles and wonders God had worked through them among the Gentiles. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>And after they had become silent, James answered, saying, &#x201C;Men <i>and</i> brethren, listen to me: </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>Simon has declared how God at the first visited the Gentiles to take out of them a people for His name. </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written:</span></p><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup><span>&#x2018;After this I will return</span></span><br><span><span>And will rebuild the tabernacle of David, which has fallen down;</span></span><br><span><span>I will rebuild its ruins,</span></span><br><span><span>And I will set it up;</span></span><br><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup><span>So that the rest of mankind may seek the L</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ord</span><span>,</span></span><br><span><span>Even all the Gentiles who are called by My name,</span></span><br><span><span>Says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> who does all these things.&#x2019;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Known to God from eternity are all His works. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>Therefore I judge that we should not trouble those from among the Gentiles who are turning to God, </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>but that we write to them to abstain from things polluted by idols, <i>from</i> sexual immorality, <i>from</i> things strangled, and <i>from</i> blood. </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>For Moses has had throughout many generations those who preach him in every city, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>Then it pleased the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas, <i>namely,</i> Judas who was also named Barsabas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren.</span></p><p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>They wrote this <i>letter</i> by them:</span></p><p><span>The apostles, the elders, and the brethren,</span></p><p><span>To the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia:</span></p><p><span>Greetings.</span></p><p><span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>Since we have heard that some who went out from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your souls, saying, &#x201C;<i>You must</i> be circumcised and keep the law&#x201D; &#x2014;to whom we gave no <i>such</i> commandment&#x2014; </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>it seemed good to us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. </span> <span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who will also report the same things by word of mouth. </span> <span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things: </span> <span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>that you abstain from things offered to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well.</span></p><p><span>Farewell.</span></p><p><span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>So when they were sent off, they came to Antioch; and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter. </span> <span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>When they had read it, they rejoiced over its encouragement. </span> <span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>Now Judas and Silas, themselves being prophets also, exhorted and strengthened the brethren with many words. </span> <span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>And after they had stayed <i>there</i> for a time, they were sent back with greetings from the brethren to the apostles.</span></p><p><span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>However, it seemed good to Silas to remain there. </span> <span><sup>35&#xA0;</sup>Paul and Barnabas also remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.</span></p><p><span><sup>36&#xA0;</sup>Then after some days Paul said to Barnabas, &#x201C;Let us now go back and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, <i>and see</i> how they are doing.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>37&#xA0;</sup>Now Barnabas was determined to take with them John called Mark. </span> <span><sup>38&#xA0;</sup>But Paul insisted that they should not take with them the one who had departed from them in Pamphylia, and had not gone with them to the work. </span> <span><sup>39&#xA0;</sup>Then the contention became so sharp that they parted from one another. And so Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus; </span> <span><sup>40&#xA0;</sup>but Paul chose Silas and departed, being commended by the brethren to the grace of God. </span> <span><sup>41&#xA0;</sup>And he went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.</span></p>'

            'Acts 10:1– 11:18': '<h3> <span>Acts 10:1-11:18</span></h3><p><span><span>10&#xA0;</span>There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band,</span></p><p><span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway.</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius.</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter:</span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,</span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending upon him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.</span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.</span></p><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon&apos;s house, and stood before the gate,</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there.</span></p><p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.</span></p><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.</span></p><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?</span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.</span></p><p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.</span></p><p><span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and he had called together his kinsmen and near friends.</span></p><p><span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.</span></p><p><span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.</span></p><p><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.</span></p><p><span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.</span></p><p><span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?</span></p><p><span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,</span></p><p><span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.</span></p><p><span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.</span></p><p><span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.</span></p><p><span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:</span></p><p><span><sup>35&#xA0;</sup>But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.</span></p><p><span><sup>36&#xA0;</sup>The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)</span></p><p><span><sup>37&#xA0;</sup>That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;</span></p><p><span><sup>38&#xA0;</sup>How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.</span></p><p><span><sup>39&#xA0;</sup>And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:</span></p><p><span><sup>40&#xA0;</sup>Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;</span></p><p><span><sup>41&#xA0;</sup>Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.</span></p><p><span><sup>42&#xA0;</sup>And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.</span></p><p><span><sup>43&#xA0;</sup>To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.</span></p><p><span><sup>44&#xA0;</sup>While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.</span></p><p><span><sup>45&#xA0;</sup>And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.</span></p><p><span><sup>46&#xA0;</sup>For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,</span></p><p><span><sup>47&#xA0;</sup>Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?</span></p><p><span><sup>48&#xA0;</sup>And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.</span></p><p><span><span>11&#xA0;</span>And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.</span></p><p><span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it by order unto them, saying,</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:</span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat.</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth.</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven.</span></p><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me.</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man&apos;s house:</span></p><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;</span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved.</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning.</span></p><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.</span></p>'

Of course, nothing human is perfect, and it wasn’t long before trouble began within the early community of faith.

For starters, not everyone was pleased with the entry of Gentile believers into the early church. The disagreement was not over the concept of a Gentile mission but over the basis on which Gentiles should be allowed to join. Some felt that faith in Jesus alone was not sufficient as the defining mark of the Christian; faith, they argued, must be supplemented with circumcision and obedience to the law of Moses. To be a true Christian, they asserted, Gentiles needed to be circumcised. (We can, in <a class="verse" verse="Acts 10:1– 11:18">Acts 10:1– 11:18</a>, see the extent of the division between Jews and Gentiles through Peter’s experience with Cornelius and the reaction that followed.)

The official visits from Jerusalem, which monitored Philip’s work among the Samaritans (<a class="verse" verse="Acts 8:14">Acts 8:14</a>) and the work with Gentiles in Antioch (<a class="verse" verse="Acts 11:22">Acts 11:22</a>), may suggest some concern about the inclusion of non-Jews in the Christian community. Yet, the reaction to Peter’s baptism of Cornelius, an uncircumcised Roman soldier, is a clear example of the disagreement that existed on the Gentile question among the earlier believers. The inclusion of an occasional Gentile such as Cornelius may have made some feel uncomfortable, but Paul’s intentional efforts to open wide the doors of the church for Gentiles on the basis of faith in Jesus alone resulted in deliberate attempts by some to undermine Paul’s ministry.

`How did certain believers from Judea try to counteract Paul’s work with Gentile Christians in Antioch? <a class="verse" verse="Acts 15:1–5">Acts 15:1–5</a>.`

Although the Jerusalem Council ultimately sided with Paul on the issue of circumcision in <a class="verse" verse="Acts 15">Acts 15</a>, the opposition to Paul’s ministry continued. About seven years later, during Paul’s final visit to Jerusalem, many were still suspicious about Paul’s gospel. In fact, when Paul visited the temple, he nearly lost his life when Jews from Asia cried out, “Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place” (<a class="verse" verse="Acts 21:28">Acts 21:28</a>; see also 21:20, 21).

`Put yourself in the position of these Jewish believers who were concerned about Paul’s teaching. Why do their concern and opposition make some sense? What can we learn from this about how our own preconceived ideas, as well as our cultural (and even religious) notions, can lead us astray? How can we learn to protect ourselves from making the same kind of errors, no matter how well-intentioned we are?`
