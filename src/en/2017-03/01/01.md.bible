            'Acts 6:9–15, 9:1–9': '<h3> <span>Acts 6:9-15</span></h3><p> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>Then there arose some from what is called the Synagogue of the Freedmen (Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and those from Cilicia and Asia), disputing with Stephen. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Then they secretly induced men to say, &#x201C;We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>And they stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes; and they came upon <i>him,</i> seized him, and brought <i>him</i> to the council. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>They also set up false witnesses who said, &#x201C;This man does not cease to speak blasphemous words against this holy place and the law; </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs which Moses delivered to us.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>And all who sat in the council, looking steadfastly at him, saw his face as the face of an angel.</span></p><h3> <span>Acts 9:1-9</span></h3><p><span><span>9&#xA0;</span>Then Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>and asked letters from him to the synagogues of Damascus, so that if he found any who were of the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.</span></p><p><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>As he journeyed he came near Damascus, and suddenly a light shone around him from heaven. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>Then he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, <span>&#x201C;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>And he said, &#x201C;Who are You, Lord?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Then the Lord said, <span>&#x201C;I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.</span> <span>It <i>is</i> hard for you to kick against the goads.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>So he, trembling and astonished, said, &#x201C;Lord, what do You want me to do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Then the Lord <i>said</i> to him, <span>&#x201C;Arise and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>And the men who journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice but seeing no one. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Then Saul arose from the ground, and when his eyes were opened he saw no one.

It’s not that hard to understand Saul of Tarsus (also known as the apostle Paul after his conversion) and why he did what he did. As a devout Jew who was taught all his life about the importance of the law and about the soon-coming political redemption of Israel, the idea of the long-awaited Messiah being ignominiously executed like the worst of criminals was just too much for him to tolerate.

No wonder, then, he was convinced that the followers of Jesus were being disloyal to the torah and, thus, hindering God’s plan for Israel. Their claims that the crucified Jesus was the Messiah and that He had risen from the dead were, he believed, rank apostasy. There could be no tolerance for such nonsense or for anyone who refused to give up those notions. Saul was determined to be God’s agent in ridding Israel of these beliefs. Hence, he first appears in the pages of Scripture as a violent persecutor of his fellow Jews, those who believed that Jesus was the Messiah.

God, however, had far different plans for Saul, plans that he never could have anticipated for himself: not only was this Jew going to preach Jesus as the Messiah, he was going to do it among the Gentiles!
