            'Daniel 2': '<h3> <span>Daniel 2</span></h3><p><span><span>2&#xA0;</span>Now in the second year of Nebuchadnezzar&#x2019;s reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; and his spirit was <i>so</i> troubled that his sleep left him. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>Then the king gave the command to call the magicians, the astrologers, the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans to tell the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>And the king said to them, &#x201C;I have had a dream, and my spirit is anxious to know the dream.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic, &#x201C;O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will give the interpretation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, &#x201C;My decision is firm: if you do not make known the dream to me, and its interpretation, you shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made an ash heap. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>However, if you tell the dream and its interpretation, you shall receive from me gifts, rewards, and great honor. Therefore tell me the dream and its interpretation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>They answered again and said, &#x201C;Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will give its interpretation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>The king answered and said, &#x201C;I know for certain that you would gain time, because you see that my decision is firm: </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>if you do not make known the dream to me, <i>there is only</i> one decree for you! For you have agreed to speak lying and corrupt words before me till the time has changed. Therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can give me its interpretation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>The Chaldeans answered the king, and said, &#x201C;There is not a man on earth who can tell the king&#x2019;s matter; therefore no king, lord, or ruler has <i>ever</i> asked such things of any magician, astrologer, or Chaldean. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup><i>It is</i> a difficult thing that the king requests, and there is no other who can tell it to the king except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>For this reason the king was angry and very furious, and gave the command to destroy all the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>So the decree went out, and they began killing the wise <i>men;</i> and they sought Daniel and his companions, to kill <i>them.</i></span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>Then with counsel and wisdom Daniel answered Arioch, the captain of the king&#x2019;s guard, who had gone out to kill the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon; </span> <span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>he answered and said to Arioch the king&#x2019;s captain, &#x201C;Why is the decree from the king so urgent?&#x201D; Then Arioch made the decision known to Daniel.</span></p><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>So Daniel went in and asked the king to give him time, that he might tell the king the interpretation. </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>Then Daniel went to his house, and made the decision known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions, </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>that they might seek mercies from the God of heaven concerning this secret, so that Daniel and his companions might not perish with the rest of the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>Then the secret was revealed to Daniel in a night vision. So Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</span></p><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Daniel answered and said:</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Blessed be the name of God forever and ever,</span><br><span>For wisdom and might are His.</span><br><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>And He changes the times and the seasons;</span><br><span>He removes kings and raises up kings;</span><br><span>He gives wisdom to the wise</span><br><span>And knowledge to those who have understanding.</span><br><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>He reveals deep and secret things;</span><br><span>He knows what <i>is</i> in the darkness,</span><br><span>And light dwells with Him.</span></p><p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;I thank You and praise You,</span><br><span>O God of my fathers;</span><br><span>You have given me wisdom and might,</span><br><span>And have now made known to me what we asked of You,</span><br><span>For You have made known to us the king&#x2019;s demand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>Therefore Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon. He went and said thus to him: &#x201C;Do not destroy the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon; take me before the king, and I will tell the king the interpretation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>Then Arioch quickly brought Daniel before the king, and said thus to him, &#x201C;I have found a man of the captives of Judah, who will make known to the king the interpretation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name <i>was</i> Belteshazzar, &#x201C;Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen, and its interpretation?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, &#x201C;The secret which the king has demanded, the wise <i>men,</i> the astrologers, the magicians, and the soothsayers cannot declare to the king. </span> <span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>But there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets, and He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will be in the latter days. Your dream, and the visions of your head upon your bed, were these: </span> <span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>As for you, O king, thoughts came <i>to</i> your <i>mind while</i> on your bed, <i>about</i> what would come to pass after this; and He who reveals secrets has made known to you what will be. </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>But as for me, this secret has not been revealed to me because I have more wisdom than anyone living, but for <i>our</i> sakes who make known the interpretation to the king, and that you may know the thoughts of your heart.</span></p><p><span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;You, O king, were watching; and behold, a great image! This great image, whose splendor <i>was</i> excellent, stood before you; and its form <i>was</i> awesome. </span> <span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>This image&#x2019;s head <i>was</i> of fine gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, </span> <span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay. </span> <span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>You watched while a stone was cut out without hands, which struck the image on its feet of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces. </span> <span><sup>35&#xA0;</sup>Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were crushed together, and became like chaff from the summer threshing floors; the wind carried them away so that no trace of them was found. And the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.</span></p><p><span><sup>36&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;This <i>is</i> the dream. Now we will tell the interpretation of it before the king. </span> <span><sup>37&#xA0;</sup>You, O king, <i>are</i> a king of kings. For the God of heaven has given you a kingdom, power, strength, and glory; </span> <span><sup>38&#xA0;</sup>and wherever the children of men dwell, or the beasts of the field and the birds of the heaven, He has given <i>them</i> into your hand, and has made you ruler over them all&#x2014;you <i>are</i> this head of gold. </span> <span><sup>39&#xA0;</sup>But after you shall arise another kingdom inferior to yours; then another, a third kingdom of bronze, which shall rule over all the earth. </span> <span><sup>40&#xA0;</sup>And the fourth kingdom shall be as strong as iron, inasmuch as iron breaks in pieces and shatters everything; and like iron that crushes, <i>that kingdom</i> will break in pieces and crush all the others. </span> <span><sup>41&#xA0;</sup>Whereas you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter&#x2019;s clay and partly of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; yet the strength of the iron shall be in it, just as you saw the iron mixed with ceramic clay. </span> <span><sup>42&#xA0;</sup>And <i>as</i> the toes of the feet <i>were</i> partly of iron and partly of clay, <i>so</i> the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly fragile. </span> <span><sup>43&#xA0;</sup>As you saw iron mixed with ceramic clay, they will mingle with the seed of men; but they will not adhere to one another, just as iron does not mix with clay. </span> <span><sup>44&#xA0;</sup>And in the days of these kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed; and the kingdom shall not be left to other people; it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever. </span> <span><sup>45&#xA0;</sup>Inasmuch as you saw that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold&#x2014;the great God has made known to the king what will come to pass after this. The dream is certain, and its interpretation is sure.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>46&#xA0;</sup>Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, prostrate before Daniel, and commanded that they should present an offering and incense to him. </span> <span><sup>47&#xA0;</sup>The king answered Daniel, and said, &#x201C;Truly your God <i>is</i> the God of gods, the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, since you could reveal this secret.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>48&#xA0;</sup>Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many great gifts; and he made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief administrator over all the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon. </span> <span><sup>49&#xA0;</sup>Also Daniel petitioned the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego over the affairs of the province of Babylon; but Daniel <i>sat</i> in the gate of the king.</span></p>'

Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</span></p><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:</span></p><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:</span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.</span></p><p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king&apos;s matter.</span></p><p><span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.</span></p><p><span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.</span></p><p><span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?</span></p><p><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king;</span></p><p><span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;</span></p><p><span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.</span></p><p><span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.</span></p><p><span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible.</span></p><p><span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>This image&apos;s head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,</span></p><p><span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.</span></p><p><span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces.</span></p><p><span><sup>35&#xA0;</sup>Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</span></p><p><span><sup>36&#xA0;</sup>This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.</span></p><p><span><sup>37&#xA0;</sup>Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.</span></p><p><span><sup>38&#xA0;</sup>And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold.</span></p><p><span><sup>39&#xA0;</sup>And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.</span></p><p><span><sup>40&#xA0;</sup>And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.</span></p><p><span><sup>41&#xA0;</sup>And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters&apos; clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.</span></p><p><span><sup>42&#xA0;</sup>And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.</span></p><p><span><sup>43&#xA0;</sup>And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.</span></p><p><span><sup>44&#xA0;</sup>And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.</span></p><p><span><sup>45&#xA0;</sup>Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.</span></p><p><span><sup>46&#xA0;</sup>Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him.</span></p><p><span><sup>47&#xA0;</sup>The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret.</span></p><p><span><sup>48&#xA0;</sup>Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.</span></p><p><span><sup>49&#xA0;</sup>Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate of the king.</span></p>'

`Where was the first Gentile church established? What events caused the believers to go there? <a class="verse" verse="Acts 11:19–21, 26">Acts 11:19–21, 26</a>. What does that remind you of from Old Testament times? See <a class="verse" verse="Daniel 2">Daniel 2</a>.`

The persecution that broke out in Jerusalem after Stephen’s death caused a number of Jewish believers to flee three hundred miles north to Antioch. As capital of the Roman province of Syria, Antioch was third only to Rome and Alexandria in significance. Its population, estimated at five hundred thousand, was extremely cosmopolitan, making it an ideal location not only for a Gentile church but as the starting base for the worldwide mission of the early church.

`What occurred inAntioch that resulted in Barnabas’s visit to the city and his subsequent decision to invite Paul to join him there? What kind of picture is presented of the church there? <a class="verse" verse="Acts 11:20–26">Acts 11:20–26</a>.`

Constructing a chronology of Paul’s life is difficult, but it appears that some five years passed between his post-conversion visit to Jerusalem (<a class="verse" verse="Acts 9:26–30">Acts 9:26–30</a>) and the invitation by Barnabas to join him in Antioch. What was Paul doing all those years? It is hard to say for sure. But based on his comments in <a class="verse" verse="Galatians 1:21">Galatians 1:21</a>, he may have been preaching the gospel in the regions of Syria and Cilicia. Some have suggested that it was perhaps during this time that he was disinherited by his family (<a class="verse" verse="Phil 3:8">Phil. 3:8</a>) and suffered a number of the hardships he describes in <a class="verse" verse="2 Corinthians 11:23–28">2 Corinthians 11:23–28</a>. However, the church in Antioch blossomed under the guidance of the Spirit. The description in <a class="verse" verse="Acts 13:1">Acts 13:1</a> indicates that the cosmopolitan nature of the city was soon reflected in the ethnic and cultural diversity of the church itself. (Barnabas was from Cyprus, Lucius from Cyrene, Paul from Cilicia, Simeon presumably from Africa, and many of the Gentiles were converts, too.) Thus, the Spirit now sought to take the gospel to even more Gentiles by using Antioch as the base for missionary activities far beyond Syria and Judea.

`Read again <a class="verse" verse="Acts 11:19–26">Acts 11:19–26</a>. What can we learn from the church at Antioch, a very culturally and ethnically diverse church, that could help churches today emulate the good that existed there?`
