            'Matt 26:59–61': '<h3> <span>Matthew 26:59-61</span></h3><p><span><sup>59&#xA0;</sup>Now the chief priests, the elders, and all the council sought false testimony against Jesus to put Him to death, </span> <span><sup>60&#xA0;</sup>but found none. Even though many false witnesses came forward, they found none. But at last two false witnesses came forward </span> <span><sup>61&#xA0;</sup>and said, &#x201C;This <i>fellow</i> said, &#x2018;I am able to destroy the temple of God and to build it in three days.&#x2019;&#x201D;</span></p>'
            'Isaiah 40–55': '<h3> <span>Isaiah 40-55</span></h3><p><span><span><span>40&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;Comfort, yes, comfort My people!&#x201D;</span></span><br><span>Says your

Zion,</span><br><span>You who bring good tidings,</span><br><span>Get up into the high mountain;</span><br><span>O Jerusalem,</span><br><span>You who bring good tidings,</span><br><span>Lift up your voice with strength,</span><br><span>Lift <i>it</i> up, be not afraid;</span><br><span>Say to the cities of Judah, &#x201C;Behold your God!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Behold, the

balance?</span><br><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Who has directed the Spirit of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>,</span><br><span>Or <i>as</i> His counselor has taught Him?</span><br><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>With whom did He take counsel, and <i>who</i> instructed Him,</span><br><span>And taught Him in the path of justice?</span><br><span>Who taught Him knowledge,</span><br><span>And showed Him the way of understanding?</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>Behold, the nations <i>are</i> as a drop in a bucket,</span><br><span>And are counted as the

worthless.</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>To whom then will you liken God?</span><br><span>Or what likeness will you compare to Him?</span><br><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>The workman molds an image,</span><br><span>The goldsmith overspreads it with gold,</span><br><span>And the silversmith casts silver chains.</span><br><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Whoever <i>is</i> too impoverished for <i>such</i> a contribution</span><br><span>Chooses a tree <i>that</i> will not rot;</span><br><span>He seeks for himself a skillful workman</span><br><span>To prepare a carved image <i>that</i> will

nothing;</span><br><span>He makes the judges of the earth useless.</span></p><p><span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>Scarcely shall they be planted,</span><br><span>Scarcely shall they be sown,</span><br><span>Scarcely shall their stock take root in the earth,</span><br><span>When He will also blow on them,</span><br><span>And they will wither,</span><br><span>And the whirlwind will take them away like stubble.</span></p><p><span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;To whom then will you liken Me,</span><br><span>Or <i>to whom</i> shall I be equal?&#x201D; says the Holy One.</span><br><span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>Lift up your eyes on high,</span><br><span>And see who has created these <i>things,</i></span><br><span>Who brings out their host by number;</span><br><span>He calls them all by name,</span><br><span>By the greatness of His might</span><br><span>And the strength of <i>His</i> power;</span><br><span>Not one is missing.</span></p><p><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>Why do you say, O Jacob,</span><br><span>And speak, O Israel:</span><br><span>&#x201C;My way is hidden from the <span style="font-variant:

strength.</span><br><span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>Even the youths shall faint and be weary,</span><br><span>And the young men shall utterly fall,</span><br><span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>But those who wait on the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span><br><span>Shall renew <i>their</i> strength;</span><br><span>They shall mount up with wings like eagles,</span><br><span>They shall run and not be weary,</span><br><span>They shall walk and not faint.</span></p><p><span><span><span>41&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;Keep silence before Me, O coastlands,</span></span><br><span>And let the people renew <i>their</i> strength!</span><br><span>Let them come near, then let them speak;</span><br><span>Let us come near together for judgment.</span></p><p><span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Who raised up one from the east?</span><br><span>Who in righteousness called him to His feet?</span><br><span>Who gave the nations before him,</span><br><span>And made <i>him</i> rule over kings?</span><br><span>Who gave <i>them</i> as the dust <i>to</i> his sword,</span><br><span>As driven stubble to his bow?</span><br><span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Who pursued them, <i>and</i> passed safely</span><br><span>By the way <i>that</i> he had not gone with his feet?</span><br><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>Who has performed and done <i>it,</i></span><br><span>Calling the generations from the

the craftsman encouraged the goldsmith;</span><br><span>He who smooths <i>with</i> the hammer <i>inspired</i> him who strikes the anvil,</span><br><span>Saying, &#x201C;It <i>is</i> ready for the soldering&#x201D;;</span><br><span>Then he fastened it with pegs,</span><br><span><i>That</i> it might not totter.</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;But you, Israel, <i>are</i> My

This great image, whose splendor <i>was</i> excellent, stood before you; and its form <i>was</i> awesome. </span> <span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>This image&#x2019;s head <i>was</i> of fine gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, </span> <span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay. </span> <span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>You watched while a stone was cut out without hands, which struck the image on its feet of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces. </span> <span><sup>35&#xA0;</sup>Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were crushed together, and became like chaff from the summer threshing floors; the wind carried them away so that no trace of them was found. And the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.</span></p><p><span><sup>36&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;This <i>is</i> the dream. Now we will tell the interpretation of it before the king. </span> <span><sup>37&#xA0;</sup>You, O king, <i>are</i> a king of kings. For the God of heaven has given you a kingdom, power, strength, and glory; </span> <span><sup>38&#xA0;</sup>and wherever the children of men dwell, or the beasts of the field and the birds of the heaven, He has given <i>them</i> into your hand, and has made you ruler over them all&#x2014;you <i>are</i> this head of gold. </span> <span><sup>39&#xA0;</sup>But after you shall arise another kingdom inferior to yours; then another, a third kingdom of bronze, which shall rule over all the earth. </span> <span><sup>40&#xA0;</sup>And the fourth kingdom shall be as strong as iron, inasmuch as iron breaks in pieces and shatters everything; and like iron that crushes, <i>that kingdom</i> will break in pieces and crush all the others. </span> <span><sup>41&#xA0;</sup>Whereas you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter&#x2019;s clay and partly of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; yet the strength of the iron shall be in it, just as you saw the iron mixed with ceramic clay. </span> <span><sup>42&#xA0;</sup>And <i>as</i> the toes of the feet <i>were</i> partly of iron and partly of clay, <i>so</i> the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly fragile. </span> <span><sup>43&#xA0;</sup>As you saw iron mixed with ceramic clay, they will mingle with the seed of men; but they will not adhere to one another, just as iron does not mix with clay. </span> <span><sup>44&#xA0;</sup>And in the days of these kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed; and the kingdom shall not be left to other people; it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever. </span> <span><sup>45&#xA0;</sup>Inasmuch as you saw that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold&#x2014;the great God has made known to the king what will come to pass after this. The dream is certain, and its interpretation is sure.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>46&#xA0;</sup>Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, prostrate before Daniel, and commanded that they should present an offering and incense to him. </span> <span><sup>47&#xA0;</sup>The king answered Daniel, and said, &#x201C;Truly your God <i>is</i> the God of gods, the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, since you could reveal this secret.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>48&#xA0;</sup>Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many great gifts; and he made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief administrator over all the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon. </span> <span><sup>49&#xA0;</sup>Also Daniel petitioned the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego over the affairs of the province of Babylon; but Daniel <i>sat</i> in the gate of the king.</span></p>'

Saul of Tarsus first appears in Acts in his involvement in the stoning of Stephen (<a class="verse" verse="Acts 7:58">Acts 7:58</a>) and then in connection with the more wide-scale persecution that broke out in Jerusalem (<a class="verse" verse="Acts 8:1–5">Acts 8:1–5</a>). Peter, Stephen, Philip, and Paul play a significant role in the book of Acts because they were involved in events that led to the spread of the Christian faith beyond the Jewish world. Stephen is of particular significance because his preaching and martyrdom appear to have had a profound influence on Saul of Tarsus.

Stephen was a Greek-speaking Jew, and one of the original seven deacons (<a class="verse" verse="Acts 6:3–6">Acts 6:3–6</a>). According to Acts, a group of foreign Jews who had come to live in Jerusalem (<a class="verse" verse="Acts 6:9">Acts 6:9</a>) entered into a dispute with Stephen over the content of his preaching about Jesus. It is possible, maybe even likely, that Saul of Tarsus was involved in these debates.

`Read <a class="verse" verse="Acts 6:9–15">Acts 6:9–15</a>. What charges were brought against Stephen? Of what do these charges remind you? See also <a class="verse" verse="Matt 26:59–61">Matt. 26:59–61</a>.`

The fierce hostility toward Stephen’s preaching appears to have resulted from two different things. On the one hand, Stephen drew the ire of his opponents by not placing primary importance on the Jewish law and the temple, which had become the focal point of Judaism and were treasured symbols of religious and national identity. But Stephen did more than merely downplay these two treasured icons; he vigorously proclaimed that Jesus, the crucified and risen Messiah, was the true center of the Jewish faith.

No wonder, then, that he angered the Pharisee Saul (<a class="verse" verse="Phil 3:3–6">Phil. 3:3–6</a>), whose zeal against the early Christians indicates that he probably belonged to a strict and militant wing of the Pharisees, one full of revolutionary fervor. Saul saw that the great prophetic promises of God’s kingdom had not yet been fulfilled (<a class="verse" verse="Daniel 2">Daniel 2</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Zech 8:23">Zech. 8:23</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Isaiah 40–55">Isaiah 40–55</a>), and he probably believed it was his task to help God bring that day about—which could be done by cleansing Israel of religious corruption, including the idea that this Jesus was the Messiah.

`Convinced that he was right, Saul was willing to put those whom he thought wrong to death. While we need zeal and fervor for what we believe, how do we learn to temper our zeal with the realization that, at times, we just might be wrong?`
