#### Inside Stories and More

Each quarter the Office of Adventist Mission brings you the exciting Inside Story column in the Adult Sabbath School Bible Study Guide. Did you know that in addition to these stories, we also provide at no charge a number of other resources containing great mission stories? All the resources listed below are available for free download at www.adventistmission.org/resources.

- **Youth and Adult Mission Quarterly**, featuring exciting mission stories each week to share in Sabbath School, academy and Pathfinder worships, home worships, and more.
- **Children’s Mission Quarterly**. In addition to exciting mission stories for children, recipes, crafts, and games are included. This excellent material may be used in children’s Sabbath Schools, school and home worships, and more.
- **Mission Spotlight.** Produced by the Office of Adventist Mission at the General Conference, these short programs give you a firsthand look at where your mission offerings are going and the opportunity to meet some of the people who will benefit from your generosity. In addition to visiting the sites of the Thirteenth Mission Offering projects,

_Mission Spotlight_ takes you to a number of places where your regular mission offerings are making a difference.

The popular Mission Spotlight DVD is great to show during Sabbath School, before the church service, during youth programs, prayer meetings, and more. It is available absolutely free from the Adventist Mission Web site.

**Thirteenth Sabbath Projects**

This quarter, the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering will be going to the Southern Asia Division (SUD) and will benefit the following projects in India:

1. **Training center in Ibrahimpatnam.** This centrally located training center will be used for lay-member training programs. The auditorium will be on the main level, with dormitory rooms on the second and third floors.
2. **Girls’ dormitory at the Seventh-day Adventist high school in Dimapur.** This Adventist high school was started seven years ago. A girls’ dormitory is now needed to accommodate more students.
3. **Girls’ dormitory at the James Memorial Higher Secondary School in Prakasapuram, Tamil Nadu.** The current building accommodates 100 girls and isn’t large enough for the demand.
4. **Fourteen new classrooms at the Seventh-day Adventist high school in Vellarada.** The current classrooms are very old and constructed with mud walls and a tin-sheet roof. The Ministry of Education building codes no longer allow conducting classes in tin-roof buildings. The new classrooms will allow the school to again function.
5. **New classroom building at the Seventh-day Adventist high school in Hatkanangale.** This school opened in 1931 as one of the most prestigious in the country. The classroom building, however, is old and needs to be replaced.
