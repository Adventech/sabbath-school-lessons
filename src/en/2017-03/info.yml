  title: "The Gospel in Galatians"
  description: "This quarter’s Bible study guide invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus. At the same time, it gives us a chance to reflect on our own understanding of the truths that opened the way for Luther’s inevitable break wih Rome and the restoration of the biblical gospel."
