`Read Revelation 14:6, 7 again. Break these verses down into smaller pieces of information. What is each of these parts talking about, and how do they all connect together?`

Jesus tells His people to share with other people the Good News that continues forever. He asks us to witness about Him to other people. He also asks us to fear God and give glory to Him. But there is something else that Jesus asks His people to do in the last days. He asks them to worship God as the One who made them. This command is part of present truth. We learned that present truth is the truth we need most for the time we live in. Present truth for our time includes:
(1) the Good News that continues forever,
(2) the command to witness about Jesus to other people, and
(3) the truth that we are living in the time when God will judge all people.
All these parts of present truth for this time mean nothing without the truth that we must worship God as the One who made us.

All parts of present truth come from the larger truth that the Lord is the One who made all things. When we worship God as the One who made us, we understand what it means to be human and to really live. We understand that we are different from any other living thing on this earth. We understand what it means to be made in God’s own likeness. That means God made us to be the same as Himself in many ways. When we worship God as the One who made us, we show everyone that we depend on God for life and for our future hope. That is why keeping the seventh-day Sabbath is very important. The Sabbath shows people that God alone is the One who made us and that we should worship only Him. So, that is why the first angel’s message makes it very clear that we should worship God as the One who made us.

`Read Revelation 14:8–11. What do these verses say that could help us understand why it is very important to worship the Lord as the One who made us?`

Soon the things Jesus warned about in the last days will happen. Many people will feel the pressure to worship the “beast [wild animal that comes from the sea]” (Revelation 13, ERV, NLV) instead of Jesus. But the warnings are clear about what will happen to people who worship this false religious power. So, we must stay true to Jesus.
