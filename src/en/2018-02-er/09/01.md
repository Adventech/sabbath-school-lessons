### Read for this week’s lesson
Revelation 2:13, 24; 2 Corinthians 11:13–15; Psalm 146:4; Revelation 13:1–17.

> <p>Memory verse</p>
> “The dragon was thrown down to earth from heaven. This animal is the old snake. He is also called [named] the Devil or Satan. He is the one who has fooled [tricked] the whole world [all the people on the earth]. He was thrown down to earth and his angels were thrown down with him” (Revelation 12:9, NLV).

Satan worked hard to trick the angels in heaven before God threw him out. “For a time, Lucifer hid his true plans under a ‘mask’ of love and respect for God. Lucifer pretended to honor God. But he was really trying to cause the angels to feel unhappy with God’s laws.”—Ellen G. White, The Great [big] Controversy [war between God and Satan], page 495; adapted.

In Eden, Satan pretended to be a beautiful snake. He used this beautiful snake to trick Eve. History shows us that, from Eden until now, Satan always uses tricks and lies (Revelation 20:8) to get what he wants.

Satan is smarter, more powerful, and sneakier than any human. That is why we need to stick close to Jesus and hold onto His truth. “ ‘But all of you who stayed with the Lord your God are alive today’ ” (Deuteronomy 4:4, ERV). This rule is true for us today, too.

This week we will look at some of the devil’s most powerful lies and tricks. We will learn what we can do to protect ourselves against them.
