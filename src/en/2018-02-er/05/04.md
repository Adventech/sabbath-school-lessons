`Read Hebrews 7:24–27 and Hebrews 8:6. What truth do we find in these verses? What hope does this truth give us?`

Jesus is our High Priest. A High Priest is someone who works to save His people. As our High Priest, Jesus can save us fully. He can save us fully because of several things He did that no religious leader or priest could ever do: (1) Jesus is God. Only God can forgive sins. Because Jesus is God, Jesus has the power to forgive sins. (2) He is our High Priest forever. Ever since the Christian church first started, Jesus has worked all the time for His people. Jesus works for His people with the same love He had when He healed the sick and comforted the lonely on this earth. (3) Jesus is also human. (4) But He was born without sin, and He never sinned. (5) As the One who Never Sinned, Jesus died for the sins of every person who ever lived. (6) Only Jesus, as the Man-God, can work for sinners in heaven’s sanctuary. Heaven’s sanctuary is the place in heaven where God is worshiped and where His throne is.

Hebrews 7:24–27 and Hebrews 8:6 also show us that Jesus’ death needed to happen only one time. His death was for everyone too. It was enough to save every human who ever lived. After all, look at who died for us. Jesus did. How could Jesus’ death not be enough to save each person?

`Read Hebrews 9:11–15. As these verses show us, what did Jesus’ death give Him to give to us? What does His work right now for us in heaven’s sanctuary also give to us too?`

Hebrews 9:12 says that Jesus “made us free from sin forever” (NLV). The Greek word written as “made us free” also means to “buy back” and “paid the price.” This Greek word is the same word used in Luke 1:68. There, Zacharias says God has “ ‘come to his people and purchased [bought] their freedom’ ” (NIrV). What else does Hebrews 9:12 tell us about Jesus’ blood? It tells us Jesus is the only One who can make us free. His death is the gift He gives to save us. This gift saves everyone who accepts it.

`Jesus did not start His work for us in the sanctuary until He made us free first. How does this fact give us hope about Jesus’ work for us right now in the sanctuary?`
