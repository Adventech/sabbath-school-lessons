### Read for this week’s lesson
Revelation 14:8; Revelation 16:19; Isaiah 52:9; Revelation 18:1–10; 1 Kings 18:1–40.

> <p>Memory verse</p>
> “The name written on her forehead was a mystery. Here is what it said. The great city of Babylon, the mother of prostitutes [people who sell sex for money], the mother of everything on earth that God hates” (Revelation 17:5, NIrV).

The book of Revelation uses many word pictures. It also uses words from the Old Testament. One example is the name Babylon. This name appears six times in Revelation. But Revelation is not talking about Nebuchadnezzar’s kingdom. That kingdom ended hundreds of years earlier. Instead, John uses this Old Testament city as a word picture to show us a truth. In the Old Testament, Babylon was a powerful kingdom with religious power. This kingdom attacked God’s people. John uses Babylon to describe the powerful governments and religious powers that attack God’s people in the last days.

John also uses “Armageddon” as a word picture. The word appears only one time in Revelation. It comes from Hebrew wording that may mean “Mountain of Megiddo.” The name “Megiddo” points us to a place in Old Testament Israel. People have many ideas about what the word “Armageddon” means. Many people think it will be a big war fought in the last days in a real place on earth named Megiddo.

This week we will look at Babylon and Armageddon as word pictures. We will try to learn what the Bible is telling us with these word pictures.
