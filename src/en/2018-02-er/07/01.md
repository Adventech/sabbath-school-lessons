### Read for this week’s lesson
Matthew 24:1–25; Revelation 13:11–17; Matthew 7:24–27; Luke 21:20.

> <p>Memory verse</p>
> “False Messiahs [Saviors] and false prophets [special messengers] will come and do great [very powerful] miracles and wonders [strange and surprising things], trying to fool [trick] the people God has chosen, if that is possible” (Matthew 24:24, ERV).

In Matthew 24 and 25, Jesus tells us important truths about the last days. He also tells us what we need to do to be ready for His Second Coming. 

Jesus’ words for His followers in His time also are for His followers in our time too. Most of all, Jesus’ words speak to the final group of people who will be alive on the earth when He comes back. Jesus does not “paint” a pretty picture of that time either. There will be wars and unproved news about wars going on. There will be disease, false saviors, and attacks on God’s people. It is easy to see how right Jesus was. Just look back over history at all the awful things that have happened since Jesus said these words. So, you see for yourself. Then you can trust Jesus’ other words, too, about the things that have not happened. 

But Jesus did not only warn us about what was coming. In Matthew 25, Jesus tells picture stories to help get His people ready to meet God. Yes, hard times will come. But Jesus will help His people to be ready to meet Him when He does come back again.
