“God’s seal is proof of His power. God’s people will be sealed in their foreheads. This seal cannot be seen. Instead, the wording ‘sealed in their foreheads’ is a word picture. It means God’s people will rest safely in the truth. They will strongly believe in God and His plan to save them. They will never turn away from the truth with their minds or in their spirits. God’s people must be sealed in their foreheads first. They must be sealed and ready for the shaking. [The shaking is a word picture. It explains the time when Christians will be tested. Everyone who is loyal to God will stay loyal to God. But there are false Christians who are not true to God’s law and are not right with God in their spirits. These false Christians will be “shaken out” of the truth and fall away from it.] The shaking will happen when God’s people are sealed and ready for it. In fact, the shaking has already started. God’s curses are already falling on this earth. God sends the curses to warn us about the things that are going to happen.”—Ellen G. White, The Faith I Live By, page 285; adapted.

“The Sabbath will be the most important test to prove our loyalty to God. The Sabbath is the part of God’s law that Satan attacks and argues against the most. The final test about the Sabbath shall come to every person on this earth. Then we will make a clear choice. All people can see who serves God and who does not. The government will make a law that forces everyone to honor Sunday as the day of rest. People who honor this false Sabbath are going against God’s fourth commandment. These people show that they are loyal to a power that is against God. People who keep the seventh-day Sabbath holy will show that they obey God’s law. They show they are loyal to the God who made them. The people who honor Sunday will get ‘the beast’s [the wild land animal’s] mark [the special proof of his power]’ (Revelation 14:9, ERV). But God’s loyal people will get God’s seal.”—Ellen G. White, The Great [big] Controversy [war between God and Satan], page 605; adapted.

**Discussion questions**

`1. How can we share the truth about the “beast’s mark” in a loving way? Why is it important to be clear that no one has this mark now?`

`2. How is the Sabbath connected to our being sealed with God’s Holy Spirit?`
