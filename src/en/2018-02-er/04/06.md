`Read Revelation 14:6, 7. What is the “Good News that lasts [continues] forever” (NLV)?`

In Revelation 14:6, 7, John describes the Good News as a message that “lasts [continues] forever” (NLV). The fact that the Good News continues forever is more proof that God does not change. A God who does not change has Good News that does not change either. God’s everlasting Good News gives hope to everyone who believes it. The Good News shows us that God’s love for us never changes. This message about God’s love needs to go to every person on this earth.

`“Even before the world [earth] was made, God chose us for Himself because of His love. He planned that we should be holy and without blame as He see us” (Ephesians 1:4, 5, NLV). How does this verse show us the truth that the Good News really does continue forever?`

“God chose us for Himself” “even before the world [earth] was made.” Wow! Now that is Good News! Even before God made this earth, God made a plan to save us.

Look at some of the words used in Ephesians 1:4, 5: “chose”; “planned”; and “because of His love” (NLV). All these words point to God’s desire for us to have everlasting life with Him. The fact that God planned to save us long before there ever was an earth is proof He loves us. His love shows us that our being saved does not come from anything we do. Instead, we are saved because of God’s love. How could our being saved come from anything we did if God already chose for us to be saved before He made us?

How do we show to other people around us that God chose us to be His people and wants them to become His people too? We show it by living lives that are “holy and without blame” before Him. God chose us for that too.

`God chose us to share the “Good News” (Revelation 14:6, NLV) with everyone on earth. This message is part of God’s message that must be shared with people everywhere before Jesus comes back. Why must we know and experience how real the Good News is in our own lives before we share it with other people?`
