In yesterday’s study, we looked at Romans 7:15–25. These verses talked about how real sin was for every human, even Christians. But just before these verses, Paul points to the law. The law shows us that the problem of sin is everywhere. The law also shows us that sin causes death.

`Read Romans 7:1–14. What do these verses tell us about the connection between the law and sin? What do these verses also tell us about how we can never be saved by the law?`

Paul teaches two important ideas in these verses. First, Paul shows us that the law is not the problem. After all, the law is “holy and right and good” (Romans 7:12, NLV). The problem is sin. Sin leads to death. Second, Paul says that the law has no power to save us from sin and death. The law clearly shows us the problem of sin and death. The law shows us our need to be saved. But the law does not offer us anything to solve the sin problem.

Only someone who was not reading Romans 7:1–14 very carefully could use these verses to say that God had thrown out the Ten Commandments. Nothing Paul is talking about would make any sense if we did not have to obey the law anymore. Paul believes that the law continues to have power in our lives. After all, it is the law that shows us that sin is real. The law shows us our need for the Good News about Jesus too. That is why Paul says: “You might think I am saying that sin and the law are the same. That is not true. But the law was the only way I could learn what sin means. I would never have known it is wrong to want something that is not mine. But the law said, ‘You must not want what belongs to someone else’ ” (Romans 7:7, ERV).

`Read Romans 7:13 carefully. What is Paul saying in this verse about the law and why we need the law even now?`

The law does not bring death. Sin does. The law shows us just how dangerous sin is. The law is good. It shows us our sin. It cannot solve the problem of sin. Only the Good News can. That is why Paul says we must “serve God in the new way, with the Spirit” (Romans 7:6, ERV). We must stay connected to Jesus. We must trust in Him to save us.
