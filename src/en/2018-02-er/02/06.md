Read Daniel 6 and then answer the questions below:

`What does Daniel 6:4, 5 tell us about Daniel? What do these verses teach us about how we should behave around other people? What does God want other people to think about us?`

`Read Daniel 6:4, 5 again. What connection is there between what happens in these verses and what happens in Revelation 13:4, 8, 11–17 in the last days?`

`Make a picture in your mind of the story in Daniel 6:4, 5. Pretend you are Daniel. What reasons could you, as Daniel, give for not praying? After all, praying would get Daniel thrown into the lions’ den. So, why could Daniel have said it was better not to pray?`

`Why do you think Daniel continued to pray as he always prayed, even when he really did not need to do that?`

`What did King Darius say to Daniel in Daniel 6:16, even before Daniel was thrown to the lions’? How do the king’s words show us he knew that Daniel’s God was powerful? How do the king’s words also show us that Daniel had witnessed to the king about the God he served and worshiped?`
