  description: "Jesus said these words to His followers during His last hours on this earth: “ ‘Do not let your heart[s] be troubled. You have put your trust in God, put your trust in Me also. There are many rooms in My Father’s house. If it were not so, I would have told you. I am going away to make a place for you. After I go and make a place for you, I will come back and take you with Me. Then you may be where I am’ ” (John 14:1–4, NLV). "
