  description: "You are a gift from God, and He loves you very much! If the Lord knows each star by name and makes sure that it is in the proper place each night (Isaiah 40:26), how much more important are you? Not every person is alike. Look around you. Everyone has different color eyes, hair, skin, and build (tall, short, big-boned, and thin). We all learn differently. Some peo- ple learn by listening, others by sight, and still others by touch. Some people use all three ways to learn."
