### Outline #4	The Cost of Rest

*  A restless king
    * 2 Samuel 11:1-2a Why was King David walking around on the rooftop veranda of his palace in the middle of the night?
    * 2 Samuel 11:2b-4 What temptation did he face and how did he respond? (see also James 1:14-15)
    * 2 Samuel 11:5-24 What were the consequences of the way King David tried to deal with his restlessness?
    * In retrospect, what should King David have been doing when he was unable to sleep while his troops were at war?
    * What lessons can we learn from this tragic story?
    * Share stories of other Bible characters who allowed their restlessness to cause them to act in ways that dishonored God. (Israelites at Ai, King Saul, etc.)

*  Confrontation by a prophet
    * 2 Samuel 12:1-9 Why did the prophet Nathan first tell a story before confronting King David directly?
    * Was the mission of the prophet Nathan to rebuke King David or to rescue him? (2 Peter 3:9)
    * How did King David respond? 2 Samuel 12:13a (see also Psalm 51:1-4)
    * Share a time when the LORD confronted you through the words of a prophet.

*  Grace for the repentant sinner
    * 2 Samuel 12:13 Is it that simple? Do we just need to confess our sin to the LORD in genuine repentance?
    * Psalm 51:5-12, 17 What additional lessons can we learn from David’s song of repentance?
    * Where else in Scripture can we find the offer of undeserved forgiveness by our loving and gracious God? 1 John 1:6-9, Luke 23:34, Romans 3:21-26, etc.
    * How would you respond to a friend who says to you, “I have asked for forgiveness, but I still don’t feel clean and I have lost the joy of salvation”?

*  Consequences
    * What negative consequences resulted from David’s sin? 2 Samuel 12:10-12,14
    * Name some other Bible characters who experienced negative consequences from their sin even though they were repentant. (Adam and Eve, Moses, etc.)
    * What positive consequences can result from a moral failure if we choose to repent and accept the merciful forgiveness of the LORD? Psalm 51:13-15
    * 1 Timothy 1:15-17 What parallels do you see between David’s song and the testimony of the apostle Paul?
    * What is your testimony about God’s love and mercy?
