After David had unwittingly pronounced judgment on himself (2 Sam. 12:5, 6), Nathan confronted him with the enormity of his sin. David’s heart was broken, and he confessed his sin. Immediately Nathan assured him that “ ‘The Lord also has put away your sin’ ” (2 Sam. 12:13, NKJV) and that he was forgiven. There was no waiting period for God’s forgiveness. David didn’t have to prove that he was really sincere before forgiveness was extended.

However, Nathan, who already had predicted the consequences of David’s sin in 2 Samuel 12:10–12, went on to state that the child to be born would die.

`What does it mean that God had taken away David’s sin? Did He just wipe the slate clean? Does everyone just simply forget about it? Read 2 Samuel 12:10–23 as you contemplate these questions.`

David also must have wondered about these questions as he saw his world crumbling—the baby dead, his family in disarray (the stories of Amnon and Absalom are two good examples of real-life family troubles), and his future uncertain. And yet, despite the consequences of his sin, which had affected innocent people such as Uriah and the newborn baby, David also began to understand that God’s grace would cover this and that someday all the consequences of sin would be done away with. In the meantime, he could find rest for his troubled conscience in God’s grace.

`What does David feel he really needs? What does he yearn for? Read Psalm 51:1–6.`

With Psalm 51, David went public as he opened his heart and confessed his sins. David’s cry for mercy appealed to God’s unfailing love and His great compassion. He yearned for renewal.

When we consider the cost of rest in Jesus, we need first to recognize that we need outside help; we are sinners and need a Savior; we recognize our sins and cry out to the only One who can wash us, cleanse us, and renew us. When we do this, we can take courage: here is an adulterer, a manipulator, a murderer, and someone who violated at least five of the Ten Commandments who called for help—and claimed the promise of God’s forgiveness.

`If God forgave David for what he did, what hope is there, then, for you?`
