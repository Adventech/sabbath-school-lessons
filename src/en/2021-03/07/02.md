Eventually, things moved in the right direction for Joseph, big time. He not only got out of prison, but he also was made prime minister of Egypt after interpreting Pharaoh’s dreams (Genesis 41). He was married and had two children of his own (Gen. 41:50–52). The storehouses of Egypt were full, and the predicted famine had begun. And then, one day, Joseph’s brothers turned up in Egypt.

`Read about the first encounter between Joseph and his brothers since they sold him into slavery in Genesis 42:7–20. Why the elaborate plot? What was Joseph trying to do with this first meeting?`

Joseph had the power and could have taken his revenge on his brothers without having to justify himself. But, rather than revenge, Joseph was concerned about the members of his family at home. He was worried about his father. Was he still alive, or had a dysfunctional famil­y become a family without a patriarch? And what about his brother Benjamin? As his father’s delight and joy, Benjamin was now in the same position that Joseph had been. Had the brothers transferred their dangerous jealousy to Benjamin? Joseph was now in a position to look out for these vulnerable people in his family, and he did just that.

Practicing biblical principles in our relationships will not mean that we ever can or should accept abuse. Each one of us is precious in God’s sight. Jesus paid the ultimate price on the cross for each one of us.

`Why does Jesus take abuse or neglect of others so personally? Read Matthew 25:41–46.`

We have all been bought through Jesus’ blood, and legally we are all His. Anyone who is abusive is attacking Jesus’ property.

Sexual abuse and emotional or physical violence are never to be a part of family dynamics. This is not just private family business to be resolved internally. This will require outside help and intervention. If you or someone in your family is being abused, please get help from a trusted professional.

`What are some biblical principles that you need to apply to whatever difficult family relationships you are now experiencing?`
