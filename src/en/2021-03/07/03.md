Joseph had forgiven his brothers. We don’t know exactly when Joseph forgave them, but it was obviously long before they showed up. Joseph probably would never have thrived in Egypt if he had not forgiven because, most likely, the anger and bitterness would have eaten away at his soul and damaged his relations with the Lord.

Several studies of survivors of tragedy inflicted on them by others have highlighted the fact that for victims of the most horrible suffering, forgiveness was a key factor to find healing and to get their lives together again. Without forgiveness, we remain victims. Forgiveness has more to do with ourselves than with the person or persons who have wronged us.

Even though Joseph had forgiven his brothers, he was not willing to let the family relationships pick up where he had left them—that is, at the dry pit at Dothan. He had to see if anything had changed.

`What did Joseph overhear? Read Genesis 42:21–24. What did he learn about his brothers?`

All communication had been taking place through an interpreter, and so Joseph’s brothers were unaware that he could understand them. Joseph heard his brothers’ confession. The brothers had thought that by getting rid of Joseph, they would be free from his reporting to their father. They thought that they would not have to put up with his dreams or watch him revel in the role of being their father’s favorite. But instead of finding rest, they had been plagued by a guilty conscience all those years. Their deed had led to restlessness and a paralyzing fear of God’s retribution. Joseph actually felt sorry for their suffering. He wept for them.

Joseph knew that the famine would still last several more years, and so he insisted that they bring Benjamin back with them the next time they came to buy grain (Gen. 42:20). He also kept Simeon hostage (Gen. 42:24).

After seeing that Benjamin was still alive, he organized a feast in which he obviously showed favoritism to Benjamin (Gen. 43:34) to see if the old patterns of jealousy were still there. The brothers didn’t show any signs of being jealous, but Joseph knew how cunning they could be. After all, they did deceive a whole town (Gen. 34:13), and he surely figured that they must have lied to their own father about his fate (Gen. 37:31–34). So, he devised one more major test. (See Genesis 44.)

`Read Genesis 45:1–15. What does this tell us about how Joseph felt about his brothers and the forgiveness he had given them? What lessons should we take away from this story for ourselves?`
