God was there at the beginning. The Lord God spoke, and it was. Light divided day from night; firmament, sky, and seas were spoken into existence on the second day; dry land and vegetation followed on the third. God formed the basic framework of time and geography, and then He filled it during the next three days. Lights governed the sky by day and by night. Different from the stories of most ancient cultures, the biblical Creation account makes it abundantly clear that the sun, the moon, and the stars are not deities. They entered into the picture only on the fourth day and are subject to the Creator’s word.

Moses’ description of days five and six (Gen. 1:20–31) is full of life and beauty. Birds, fish, land animals—they all fill the space prepared by God.

`What did God’s evaluation indicate about Creation? Read Genesis 1:1–31.`

This was not just any space that God had created; it was a perfect place. Teeming creatures filled the earth. Like the refrain of a catchy tune, God kept saying that it was “good” after each day.

`What was different about the creation of humanity from the rest of the world? Read Genesis 1:26, 27 and Genesis 2:7, 21–24.`

God stooped and began to shape mud. Humanity’s creation in God’s image and likeness was an object lesson in intimacy and closeness. God bent down and breathed life into Adam’s nostrils, and there was a living being. Eve’s special creation from Adam’s rib added another important element to Creation week. Marriage was part of God’s design for humanity—a sacred trust of partnership between ’ish and ’ishshah, “man” and “woman.”

This time, when God looked at everything He had made on day six, the refrain sounded different: “Then God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was very good” (Gen. 1:31, NKJV; italics supplied).

`Think about how radically different the biblical Creation story is from what humanity, without the guidance of God’s Word, teaches. What should this tell us about how much we need to depend on God’s Word for understanding truth?`
