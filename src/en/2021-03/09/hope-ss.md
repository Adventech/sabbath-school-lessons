### Outline #9	The Rhythms of Rest

*  The creation of a perfect environment
	* Genesis 1:1-5, 6-8, 9-13, 14-19, 20-23, 24-25, 31 What theme do you hear repeated through this inspired account of creation?
	* Genesis 1:26-27, 2:7, 23-25 What was unique about the creation of the human family?
	* Intelligent people present a completely different account of the origin of life on this planet. What presuppositions lead them to their conclusions?
	* If an eternal, omnipotent God exists, what hinders Him from creating an inhabited planet like the one described in Genesis 1?
	* The theme of God’s creative activity is repeated throughout the Bible. Give some examples.

*  The provision of a day of rest
	* Genesis 2:1-3 How does this inspired account describe the gift of the Sabbath?
	* There is no mention in this text that the human family should also rest on that day. Where do we find a command to rest each Sabbath day? Exodus 20:8-11
	* Why is keeping the Sabbath holy given as a command and not simply a recommendation?
	* What specific sequence of miracles clearly identified the Sabbath each week? Why? Exodus 16:14-31
	* What additional meaning regarding the Sabbath is given in Deuteronomy 5:12-15?
	* What teaching of Jesus confirms that the Sabbath wasn’t simply for the Jews but for the entire human family? Mark 2:27
	* Why did Jesus speak with such authority about the purpose of the Sabbath? John 1:1-3,14, Mark 2:28

*  Keeping the Sabbath holy
	* What did our Creator have in mind when He commanded the human family to keep the Sabbath holy?
	* What inspired texts help us to understand God’s intention regarding Sabbath observance? Psalm 92:1-4 (a song for the Sabbath day), Matthew 12:10-12, Leviticus 19:3, etc.
	* Share some admonitions in the Scriptures to gather for corporate worship each Sabbath, in addition to our personal communion time with the LORD. Leviticus 23:3, Luke 4:16, Hebrews 10:25, etc.
	* Isaiah 58:13-14 How can we help our family and friends to experience the gift of the Sabbath as a delight?
	* Share your testimony of a delightful Sabbath.  Why was that time so special for you?
