### Outline #8	Free to Rest

*  An urgent need for physical healing
	* Mark 2:1-4 What impresses you as you listen to this story?
	* What need for healing is most obvious here?
	* Share a time when you experienced a major health challenge. Who was a revelation of God’s love and care during that difficult time?

*  Spiritual healing
	* Mark 2:5 What can we learn from the words of Jesus when the paralytic was laid at His feet?
	* How did the paralytic respond? (surrender, then obedience – Mark 2:12)
	* Share your testimony of a time when you needed spiritual healing.

*  Healing from depression
	* Elijah:
		* 1 Kings 19:1-4 What are some factors that might have brought Elijah to such a depressed mental state?
		* What encouragement do you find in the response of the LORD to Elijah’s desperate prayer? 1 Kings 19:5-8, 9-18 (see also 2 Kings 2:11)
	* Invalid at the Pool of Bethesda
		* John 5:2,5-7 What does the response of this invalid at the Pool of Bethesda reveal about his mental condition?
		* How did Jesus respond? v.8
	* In both stories, there is no condemnation. Why is it important to recognize God’s love and acceptance when we are struggling with anxiety or depression?
	* Share some Bible passages that offer encouragement during a time of anxiety or depression. Psalm 50:15, Lamentations 3:22-26, Philippians 4:6-7, etc.

*  Hindrances to personal healing
	* People – Mark 2:6-11 (see also Luke 18:35-39) What are some other ways people might hinder our path to personal healing?
	* Refusal to have faith – Mark 2:5, 5:34, Luke 18:42 How much faith is necessary to experience the personal healing God’s desires for us?
	* Guilt – “It’s my fault.  This sickness is the result of my own poor choices.” How would you respond?
	* Ignorance – How can we help people become aware of the fact that God is willing and able to make them whole?
	* How can we stay open to God’s will as we cry out for healing, for ourselves or someone we love? Luke 22:42, 2 Corinthians 12:7-10
	* Share a testimony of personal healing.
