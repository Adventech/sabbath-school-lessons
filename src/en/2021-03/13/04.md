The prophetic big picture of history doesn’t just allow us to sit back and do nothing as events unfold, events that we really can’t control. So often the attitude can be “Well, final events are going to happen as predicted, so what can we do about it other than just simply go along with them? After all, what can I alone do?”

But that’s not how Christians are to relate to the world around them and, especially, to final events. Revelation 14 tells us that our purpose at this time in history is to tell others about God’s judgment and help them prepare for the second coming of Jesus.

`Read Revelation 14:6–12. What is being taught here, and what are we to proclaim to the world? Why is this message of such urgency?`

As Adventists, we believe that “present truth” (2 Pet. 1:12) is found, specifically, in these verses that we refer to as “the three angels’ messages.” Here we find the essence of what our calling is at this time in earth’s history.

Notice, it starts out with the “everlasting gospel,” the wonderful news of Christ’s death and resurrection, upon which our only hope of salvation rests. There also is the message that “the hour of His judgment has come” (Rev. 14:7, NKJV), a powerful waymark that points to the end of time. Then, too, there is the call to worship the one “who made heaven and earth,” in contrast to the fearful warning about those who, staying in Babylon, worship “the beast and his image.” Finally there is the depiction of God’s end-time people: “Here is the patience of the saints; here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus” (NKJV).

`Read Revelation 14:11. What does it say about the lack of rest for those who worship the beast and his image?`

No rest, day or night, for those who worship the beast and his image? Though various ideas exist regarding what this exactly means, all would agree that these people do not experience the kind of rest that God offers those who are faithful to Him.

`Why do you think the first part of the three angels’ messages is the “everlasting gospel”? Why must we keep this wonderful truth always before us as we proclaim these messages to the world? How is understanding the gospel so central to the concept of rest?`
