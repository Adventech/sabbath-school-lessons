	* What special message from Jesus brought comfort and hope to the aged apostle and also brings comfort and hope to us today? Revelation 1:9-19, 21:1-5, 22:1-5
	* Share a time in your life when the future looked bleak and you needed a special revelation of comfort and hope from the LORD.

	* What revelation had Jesus already given to John and the other apostles? Matthew 24:3-8, 9-13 23-31

	* What lesson can we learn from the faithful saints through the ages, many of whom laid down their lives rather than disobey or dishonor God? Hebrews 11:13-16, 12:1-2
	* Why is the counsel of the apostle Paul to Christians in Philippi so relevant for our lives today? Philippians 4:4-7
	* How can we help our family and friends experience rest in Christ even in the midst of troubled times?
