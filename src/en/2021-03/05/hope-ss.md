### Outline #5	The Invitation of Jesus: “Come to Me”

*  The promise of Jesus to give rest for our souls
    * Matthew 11:28 What is necessary on our part in order to receive rest for our souls from Jesus?
    * The verb “Come” is an imperative—a command or earnest appeal. Why is this invitation of Jesus so urgent?
    * Anyone can offer rest. How can we be certain Jesus is able to fulfill His promise? Matthew 11:27
    * What hinders people from coming to Jesus and finding rest for their souls? Matthew 11:21-24, Romans 10:14
    * What burdens might Satan tempt us to pick up in an attempt to disrupt our rest in Jesus?

*  The yoke Jesus offers
    * Matthew 11:29-30 What is a yoke? What does Jesus mean when He says, “Take My yoke upon you”?
    * A disciple is a learner. What lessons do we need to “learn” from Jesus?
    * When did Jesus call you to become His disciple (to learn from Him)? How has your life changed since you responded to His invitation?

*  Modeling gentleness and meekness
    * Matthew 11:29 What does it mean to be gentle and lowly in heart?
    * The apostle Paul speaks of the “meekness and gentleness of Christ” (2 Corinthians 10:1). Give examples of Jesus modeling meekness and gentleness.
    * Why is the characteristic of meekness so important for a disciple of Jesus? Matthew 5:5, Isaiah 57:15

*  The pleasant yoke
    * Matthew 11:30 Why is the yoke Jesus offers us “easy” or “pleasant”?
    * The New Testament speaks of trying to save ourselves by our own good works as a yoke of bondage (Galatians 5:1). When did you come to the realization that salvation comes through connecting with Jesus as your loving and merciful Savior?

*  The light burden
    * Matthew 11:30 What is the light burden Jesus offers in exchange for our heavy burdens? (see Luke 10:2)
    * Review the life of Jesus. Where do you see evidences of His burden for the lost? Luke 19:10
    * Why is His burden light? Hebrews 12:1-3
    * How does caring for the lost fulfill the law of Christ? Galatians 6:2
    * Share a time when you felt a burden for those who don’t know Jesus. How did you respond?
