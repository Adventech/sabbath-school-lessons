### Outline #11	Longing for More

*  Learning from the example of others
	* What are some positive lessons you have learned from the example of others?
	* What are some attitudes or behaviors you have chosen to avoid as a result of observing the examples of others?
	* Romans 15:4 Why are so many stories included in the Bible, including accounts of unfaithfulness and failure?
	* 1 Corinthians 10:1-11 What lessons can we learn from the example of the children of Israel on their extended journey from Egypt to the Promised Land?

*  Types and symbols
	* Exodus 25:8-9 Describe the earthly sanctuary, constructed after the pattern given to Moses by the LORD.
	* Hebrews 8:1-5 What was the LORD wanting to teach the children of Israel through these symbols or types of heavenly realities?
	* Consider, for example, the details regarding the sin offering, recorded in Leviticus 4:32-35. What precious truth is foreshadowed in this service? John 1:29, 1 Peter 1:18-21, 1 Timothy 1:15, etc.
	* Sometimes we become careless, like the children of Israel.  How would our attitude toward sin change if we constantly kept in mind the cost paid for our redemption? (see Psalm 16:8)

*  Entering into God’s rest
	* Hebrews 4:1-11 What lessons can we learn from the experience of the children of Israel about entering into God’s rest?
	* It’s possible to know a great deal of information about God and the plan of salvation and still not enter into God’s rest. What can protect us from falling into the same example of disobedience? Hebrews 4:2
	* How would you respond if a friend said to you, “I want to find rest for my soul in God, but I don’t have enough faith”?
	* Why is it so dangerous to put off responding to God’s invitation to enter into His rest? Psalm 95:6-8
	* What is the relationship between the gift of the Sabbath day and the LORD’s invitation to enter more fully into His rest?
	* Share some biblical examples of troubled individuals who chose to enter into God’s rest. (Saul of Tarsus, the demoniac from Gadara, Mary Magdalene, etc.)
	* How has your life changed since you made the decision to enter into God’s rest?
