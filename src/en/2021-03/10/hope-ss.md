### Outline #10	Sabbath Rest

*  Sabbath, a gift from our Creator
	* Genesis 2:1-3 Why did the Creator of the heavens and the earth bless and sanctify the seventh day? (see also Mark 2:27)
	* Genesis 1:26-27, 9:6 What was special about the creation of the human family?
	* How did God invite Adam and Eve to participate in His creative work? Genesis 1:28, 2:15,19
	* Why is it important to recognize that the Sabbath was given as a special time for fellowship with our Creator?

*  Sabbath, a day to celebrate our freedom in Christ
	* Compare Exodus 20:8-11 and Deuteronomy 5:12-15 What differences do you notice?
	* Most of us have never been held hostage as slaves in a foreign land, like the children of Israel in Egypt, but we have all been enslaved in one way or another. John 8:34-36, Hebrews 12:1-2
	* What freedom have you experienced in Christ that you can celebrate, especially each Sabbath?

*  Sabbath, a day to share God’s blessings with others
	* Exodus 19:6, 1 Peter 2:9 What was God’s plan for Israel, and also for the Christian church?
	* Notice the last phrase in Exodus 20:10. Why is “the stranger who is within your gates” included in the Sabbath commandment? (see also Exodus 23:12)
	* What does this mean in practical terms? How can we share the Sabbath blessing with others who have not yet learned about God’s holy day of rest?
	* How did Jesus share God’s blessings with others on the Sabbath day? Mark 1:21-28, 29-34, John 5:7-16
	* Why did the Jewish leaders react with such hostility and totally ignore the blessing Jesus had bestowed?
	* Share a time in your life when you viewed Sabbath more as a religious obligation rather than a time to share God’s blessings with others.

*  Sabbath, a reminder of God’s sanctifying work
	* Exodus 31:13 Why is it important to remember that the LORD is the One who sanctifies us?
	* What word of encouragement did the apostle Paul share with Christians in Philippi regarding God’s sanctifying work in their lives? Philippians 1:3-11
	* What words of admonition did the apostle Peter give especially for those living in the last days of earth’s history? 2 Peter 3:10-18
	* What counsel would you give to friends who long for Sabbath to be a time to deepen their relationship with their Creator and Redeemer?
