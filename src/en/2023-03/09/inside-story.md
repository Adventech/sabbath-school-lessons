#### Diapers on Grocery List

_By Amy McHenry_

One Friday morning, I was doing the weekly shopping at our local grocery store in Beirut, Lebanon. My husband, Peter, was buying apples and granola bars for the Pathfinders’ weekend hike, and I was getting the family food. We serve as missionaries teaching biology at Middle East University.

As I went upstairs to get some disinfectant and dish soap, I glanced down the diaper aisle and saw someone looking at diapers. I thought to myself how hard it must be for people who need diapers in Lebanon. The financial situation is extremely difficult, with the Lebanese currency having lost more than 90 percent of its value in two years and the cost of goods skyrocketing. More than 80 percent of the country lives below the poverty line.

Suddenly a command popped into my head, “Buy a package of diapers.”

I was surprised at this sudden thought. “Lord, is that You?” I asked. “Why would I buy diapers? The youngest of my three children is 10 years old!”

“Buy a package of diapers.”

I started to walk toward the escalator.

“Lord, I don’t even know anyone with a baby who needs diapers.”

The command became more insistent, “Buy a package of diapers.”

I walked back to the diaper aisle and prayed, “OK, Lord, I’ll buy some diapers, and You’ll just have to show me later who they are for. What size should I get?” I grabbed a package of size 3 diapers and continued shopping.

When my husband and I met at the car, I told him, “Don’t be surprised if you see a package of diapers in the trunk. The Lord told me to purchase them. They’re a gift, but I don’t know who they’re for yet.” We drove home.

The next day at church, I saw a friend whose wife works with refugee families in Beirut. We chatted for a while, and I asked him, “Do you think your wife might know someone who needs diapers? The Lord told me to get some yesterday, and I don’t know who they are for.” He promised to ask her.

That evening I received a text from him. “When I told my wife your story about the diapers, she started to cry,” he wrote. “Tomorrow she will be visiting two families who need diapers. Can we pick them up tonight?”

A short while later, as we hugged and chatted at the door, I handed her the diapers that God had put on my grocery list. I learned that she works with more than twenty families who need diapers and can’t afford them. Now I know to put diapers on my grocery list more often.
