#### Fighting With Scripture: Part 3

_By Andrew McChesney_

That night, Almira woke up after having another nightmare, and she resolved to go to the Seventh-day Adventist Church the next Sabbath. But in the morning, she thought, I’m not a Christian. I can’t go there. The following night, she had another nightmare, and she struggled again over what to do. On Sabbath, she went to the Adventist Church.

After several weeks, Almira’s parents found out that she was attending the church every Sabbath, and they forbade her from going. Other relatives heard and implored her not to go. Neighbors saw her walking to the church on Sabbaths and purposely came out of their apartment buildings to scold her. Going to church became a deeply unpleasant battle every Sabbath. But Almira enjoyed worshiping at the church, and she kept on going. She was learning about Jesus and finding peace in Him.

But at home the evil presence persisted. The spirit kept coming at night. Almira began to pray out loud, “In the name of the blood of Jesus Christ, protect me from Satan so I can sleep.” She prayed the prayer every night for three months. The prayers dispelled the spirit, but she remained scared.

She told the Adventist pastor about her fears, and he suggested that she also read the Bible out loud. Whenever she sensed the spirit, she opened her Bible to Isaiah 43. She especially liked the promise, “But now, thus says the Lord, who created you, O Jacob, and He who formed you, O Israel: ‘Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by your name; You are Mine.’ . . . Since you were precious in My sight, you have been honored, and I have loved you; therefore I will give men for you, and people for your life” (Isaiah 43:1–4, NKJV).

She also found comfort in Isaiah 49:24, 25, which says, “Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the captives of the righteous be delivered? But thus says the Lord: ‘Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible be delivered; for I will contend with him who contends with you, and I will save your children’ ” (NKJV).

One night, she confessed all her sins out loud to Jesus. After that, she slept better than she had in a long time.

Finally, Almira stopped being afraid. When she read the Bible and prayed, the spirit always left. She realized that even though the spirit was stronger than her, Jesus was stronger than them both.
