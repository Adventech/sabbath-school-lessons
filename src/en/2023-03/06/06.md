`Paul concludes his prayer report with a doxology, a brief, poetic statement of praise to God. For what does he praise God? Eph. 3:20, 21.`

Paul has been recording his prayers for believers (Eph. 3:14–19). Now he prays directly and powerfully. Paul’s doxology raises two questions:

1. Does the passage inappropriately elevate the church, placing it on a par with Christ, in the phrase “to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus” (Eph. 3:21, ESV)? While Paul is highly interested in the church in Ephesians, it is clear that Christ is the Savior of the church since it is Christ who dwells in the hearts of believers (Eph. 3:17). In the doxology, Paul praises God for the salvation offered to the church through Christ Jesus.

2. Does the phrase “throughout all generations, forever and ever” (Eph. 3:21, ESV) portray an unending, earthbound future for the church, with the return of Christ put on hold? Ephesians exhibits a robust expectation for the future. For example, Ephesians 4:30 looks toward “the day of redemption” (ESV). Also, believers will experience Christ’s limitless, sovereign power in “the age to come” (Eph. 1:21, NRSV). Paul’s doxology should be read as a celebration of Christ’s unending power exercised on behalf of believers.

Looking back over Paul’s second prayer report (Eph. 3:14–21; compare Eph. 1:15–23), we see Paul finding strength in the cosmic scope of the Father’s care (Eph. 3:14, 15), the ready availability of the Holy Spirit (Eph. 3:16), the partnership of Christ Himself (Eph. 3:17), and the immeasurability of the limitless love of Christ (Eph. 3:18, 19). This is so true that he imagines believers being filled “with all the fullness of God” (Eph. 3:19, ESV) and celebrates these spiritual realities in praise, again marveling at the abundance of God’s power on offer to the saints (Eph. 3:20, 21).

Whenever we feel the press of problems, temptations, or doubts, we may turn to this buoyant account of Paul’s prayers. The imprisoned apostle raises our vision to the grand horizon of God’s purposes and grace, reminding us that, whatever our current circumstances, we are participants in God’s ultimate plan (Eph. 1:9, 10), and His power is at work in us.

`What blessings from God are especially valuable to you? Practice composing a prayer of praise in order to praise God for them.`
