`How does Paul summarize the ministry of Christ in Ephesians 2:17, 18?`

The concept of peace is important in Ephesians, with the letter beginning and ending with blessings of peace “from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ” (Eph. 1:2, NKJV; compare Eph. 6:23). Earlier in Ephesians 2:11–22, Paul argued that Christ personifies peace, “For He Himself is our peace,” and that His Cross creates it (Eph. 2:14–16, NKJV). Christ not only destroys something—the hostility between Jew and Gentile (Eph. 2:14, 15)—He creates a new humanity, marked by relationships of reconciliation and peace (Eph. 2:15–17). Such peace is not just the absence of conflict but resonates with the Hebrew concept of shalom, the experience of wholeness and well-being, both in our relationship with God (Rom. 5:1) and with others.

`How does Paul imagine believers participating in sharing Jesus’ message of peace? Eph. 4:3; Eph. 6:14, 15; compare Rom. 10:14, 15 with Eph. 2:17–19, Isa. 52:7, Isa. 57:19.`

The Gospels contain examples of Jesus as a preacher of peace. In His farewell messages to the disciples, He promises them—and us—“ ‘Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you’ ” (John 14:27, NKJV). And He concludes, “ ‘I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world’ ” (John 16:33, ESV). After His resurrection, when He appears to the disciples, He repeatedly says to them, “ ‘Peace be with you’ ” (John 20:19, 21, 26, ESV).

In Ephesians 2:17, 18, Paul is keen to point out that Christ’s preaching of peace extended beyond the time of His earthly ministry. He has “preached peace” in the present to both “far” (Gentile believers before they were converted; ESV) and “near” (Jewish believers, ESV; compare Eph. 2:11–13). Having accepted this proclamation, all believers experience a profound blessing.

`How can we learn to be preachers of peace as opposed to conduits of conflict? To what situations, right now, can you help bring healing?`
