`Read Ephesians 4:1–16. How does Paul encourage believers to nurture the unity of the church?`

Paul begins the second half of Ephesians (chapters 4–6) with a stirring call to unity, but in two major parts. First, in Ephesians 4:1–6 he asks believers to nurture “the unity of the Spirit” by exhibiting unity-building virtues (Eph. 4:1–3), a call he supports with a poetic list of seven “ones” (Eph. 4:4–6). Second, in Ephesians 4:7–16, Paul identifies the victorious, exalted Jesus as the Source of grace in people who lead in sharing the gospel (Eph. 4:7–10) and describes how they, together with all church members, contribute to the health, growth, and unity of the body of Christ (Eph. 4:11–16).

As the chapter begins, Paul invites Christians to “walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called” (Eph. 4:1, ESV). He used the verb _walk_ in the figurative sense of _to behave_, or _to live _(see Eph. 2:2, 10; Eph. 4:17; Eph. 5:2, 8, 15). When Paul refers to their calling, he refers to the call to Christian faith (Eph. 1:18; Eph. 2:4–6, 13). Paul urges believers to practice a unifying behavior that reflects God’s ultimate plan (Eph. 4:9, 10). He begins that emphasis here with his call to practice virtues that lead to unity (Eph. 4:1–3), such as humility, gentleness, and patience.

Let’s look at each term.

Paul elsewhere explains the term humility, in Ephesians 4:2 (ESV; “lowliness” in NKJV), by adding the idea to “count others more significant than yourselves” (Phil. 2:3, ESV). Humility, then, may be understood not as a negative virtue of self-deprecation (see Col. 2:18, 23) but as a positive one of appreciating and serving others.

Gentleness (Eph. 4:2, ESV, NKJV) may be explained as “the quality of not being overly impressed by a sense of one’s self-importance” and also means “courtesy, considerateness, meekness.”—Frederick Danker, ed., _Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature_, 3rd ed. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2000), p. 861.

Finally, patience (ESV; compare “longsuffering,” NKJV) is being able to bear up under provocation or trials. These qualities, then, all gather around the theme of turning away from self-importance and, instead, focusing on the value of others.

`Humility, gentleness, patience. Think about how these attributes would help unify us as a people. How do we learn to cultivate these virtues?`
