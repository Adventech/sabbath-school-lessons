`Read Acts 19:21–20:1. What lessons can we draw from this story?`

Paul’s witness in the large, sophisticated city of Ephesus was so effective that it impacted an important economic engine for the city, tourism focused on the Temple of Artemis. And what a temple it was! This magnificent structure was composed partly of 127 pillars, each 60 feet high, of Parian marble, a pure-white, flawless marble highly prized for sculptures. Thirty-six of these pillars were sculpted and overlaid with gold, earning the temple its reputation as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.

Concerned that Paul’s anti-idolatry rhetoric was draining financial support from the temple (Acts 19:27), Demetrius the silversmith whipped his fellow craftsmen into a frenzy. A rapidly expanding and highly energized crowd swept from the marketplace into the large amphitheater, which seated some twenty-five thousand people. There the commotion continued, featuring two continuous hours of shouting “ ‘Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!’ ” (Acts 19:34, ESV). After the crowd is dispersed by the town clerk, Paul meets with the believers and leaves the city.

`At the end of his third missionary journey, Paul meets with elders of the Ephesian church. How would you summarize Paul’s concerns? See Acts 20:17–38.`

A tentative chronology of Paul’s relationship to Ephesus:

\* ad 52: Paul’s initial, brief visit to Ephesus (Acts 18:18–21).

\* ad 53–56: Paul’s three-year ministry in Ephesus (Acts 19:1–20:1). He composes 1 Corinthians near the end of his stay there (1 Cor. 16:5–9).

\* ad 57: While at Miletus, Paul meets with the elders from Ephesus (Acts 20:17–38).

\* ad 62: Paul composes his letter to the Ephesians, probably from confinement in Rome.

`“Therefore watch, and remember that for three years I did not cease to warn everyone night and day with tears,” said Paul (Acts 20:31, NKJV). What do you think Paul would warn our church about today, and why?`
