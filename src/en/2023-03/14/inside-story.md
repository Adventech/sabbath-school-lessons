#### Praising God for Epilepsy

_By Andrew McChesney_

Anna Rozenberga has struggled with epilepsy since she was a child in Riga, Latvia. It wasn’t only about seizures. Epilepsy affected her emotions and brain functions. It was hard for her to focus. She longed to be healed.

The summer after she graduated from high school, the 19-year-old teen went to a psychic who claimed she could heal her. When the psychic saw she could not help, she told Anna about another client who found healing through a pastor’s prayer. The psychic gave Anna the pastor’s phone number.

“He will tell you a lot about his church and God, but don’t listen to him,” she said. “Just take the healing and leave. The rest of what he says is a lie.”

Anna called the pastor. In their phone conversation, she heard for the first time about the Seventh-day Adventist Church. They agreed to meet. At their second meeting, the pastor prayed for Anna. But the epilepsy remained.

Anna liked the pastor and accepted an invitation to attend Bible studies. Later that summer, she attended a small group meeting at the church. Then she went to a Sabbath worship service. “You know what?” she told her mother afterward. “I think the church is good.”

So, Anna’s mother went with her to church. A few months later, Anna was attending church with both her mother and father. The next summer, Anna and her mother were baptized. A year later, her father was baptized. Then her grandmother and brother were baptized.

Over the years, many people have prayed for Anna. She has been anointed with oil. But the epilepsy has remained. Anna wondered why God had not healed her, but then it struck her. Like to the apostle Paul, who also prayed for relief, God was saying to her, “My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness” (2 Corinthians 12:9, NKJV).

Now 30, Anna sees epilepsy as a blessing. Since it is an illness she must deal with every day, she has learned she needs to trust God even more. Some Sabbath mornings she feels like staying in bed, but then she remembers she is scheduled to participate in church. So, she goes to church and trusts that God will pull her through.

Epilepsy also has helped her witness. The challenge has given her empathy for others. She doesn’t always mention her epilepsy when she first meets people, but she has found that being vulnerable about herself helps others open up and listen. “So my epilepsy has helped me spread the Word,” Anna says. “I am thankful for the challenges with my health.”
