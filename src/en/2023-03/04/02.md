`Read Ephesians 2:1–10. What is the main idea that Paul is giving us here about what Jesus has done for us?`

Paul has already described the salvation given to Christians (Eph. 1:3–14, 15–23) and told, in brief, the story of the believers in Ephesus (Eph. 1:13). In Ephesians 2:1–10, Paul will now tell their conversion story in more detail, with a more personal focus. He contrasts their past, sinful existence (Eph. 2:1–3) with the blessings of God’s salvation, which he portrays as a participation in the resurrection, ascension, and exaltation of Christ (Eph. 2:4–7), and he celebrates the basis of that salvation in the grace and creative work of God (Eph. 2:8–10).

These three sections of the passage are summarized neatly in the phrases of Ephesians 2:5: (1) “we were dead in our trespasses”; (2) God “made us alive together with Christ”; (3) “by grace you have been saved” (ESV).

In Ephesians 2:1, 2, Paul underlines the sad reality of the pre-­conversion existence of his audience by noting that they were spiritually dead, practicing trespasses and sins as their regular pattern of life (Eph. 2:1), and were dominated by Satan (Eph. 2:2). Since Paul writes to living people, he refers to them as once “dead” in a metaphorical sense _(_compare Eph. 5:14). However, their plight was very real and dire since they were once separated from God, the Source of life (compare Col. 2:13, Rom. 5:17, Rom. 6:23).

Reflecting on the past lives of his hearers, Paul identifies two external forces that dominated them. The first of these is “the course of this world” (Eph. 2:2, NKJV)—the customs and behavior in the wider society of Ephesus that misshaped human life into rebellion against God.

Satan is described in two ways as the second external force that dominated their prior existence. He is “the prince of the power of the air” (Eph. 2:2, NKJV) since “the air” (or “the heavenly places”) is identified as the location of supernatural powers, including evil ones (compare Eph. 1:3, Eph. 3:10, Eph. 6:12). Also, he is active on earth since he is “the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience” (Eph. 2:2, NKJV).

`What do these verses teach about the reality of the great controversy? At the same time, how can we draw comfort and hope in the knowledge that Jesus has been victorious and that we can share in His victory now?`
