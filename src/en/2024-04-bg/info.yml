  title: "Fourth Quarter. Year A"
  description: "In each issue of the Beginner Bible Study Guide you will find only three lessons— one for each month of the quarter. This gives your child a better opportunity to learn concepts emphasized throughout the month and to offer more repetition. Children at this age learn best through repetition."
