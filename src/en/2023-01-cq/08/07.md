`Based on this week’s narrative, what, in your opinion, is the main reason we need to support the ministry of authorized pastors?`

`Why shouldn’t people involved in independent or supporting ministries, as good as they may be, be supported by tithe funds? Or should they?`

`What do you believe are the goals attained by Satan if he is able to manage things so that the storehouse system should not work?`

`Was it by chance that Hezekiah asked the people to bring their thank offerings only after the priests presented the sin offering for all Israel? Is there a purpose in this sequence?`

`Should offerings be or not be something spontaneous? Why then are church leaders supposed to invite, educate, and motivate people to give, as did Hezekiah?`

`What is the problem with waiting for spontaneity while expecting what is good and right?`

`What damage would be inflicted on the worldwide missionary strategy of the church if every member would bring their tithes and regular offerings only to where it seems right in their own eyes (Deut. 12:8)?`

`In what sense is bringing my offering to the storehouse, instead of sending it to a preferred project or missionary, a humbling but needed experience?`

`What are the differences between regular and special offerings?`

`If not already, how can you get involved with the storehouse system?`
