`Why did the Lord protect David, Jehoshaphat, and others from their enemies, but did not protect Ahaz? Isn’t God a God who discriminates, a respecter of persons? Explain.`

`What would you answer to someone that affirms that the Lord does forbid marriages with unbelievers, but does not forbid dating them? Is this statement true? Explain.`

`Why is it so serious if someone refuses to test the Lord when God Himself is inviting us to test Him?`

`Ahaz gave a lot of his own resources to worship idols (and spirits). What was his motivation? By contrast, what should motivate true Christians to bring regular offerings and the tithe?`

`How does the fact that tithes and offerings should be given in proportion to the blessing help worshippers develop the right motivation to give?`

`Why won’t sacrificing too much and giving too much necessarily promote God’s acceptance of my offering?`

`If we are supposed to return tithes and regular offerings in recognition of blessings and not in expectation of them, why does God still promise to bless us after we bring them?`

`Are noncanonical prophets, such as Nathan, Deborah, and Ellen G. White, inspired in the same manner as the canonical ones, or there are different levels of inspiration (second- or third-category prophets)?`

`Was it safe for David, for example, to disregard God’s messages through Nathan just because Nathan was not a canonical prophet?`

`What is the risk if I use my reasoning to judge inspired writings to determine which parts are authoritative or normative and which are not?`
