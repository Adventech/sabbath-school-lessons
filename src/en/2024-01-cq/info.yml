  title: "Jesus and Liberty"
  description: "A few months ago, I participated in a small interfaith panel that discussed religious liberty. At this event, I sat between a Buddhist teacher and a Roman Catholic priest—people whose beliefs are very different from my own. I was glad to have the opportunity to share a few Seventh-day Adventist perspectives on religious liberty with this diverse audience"
