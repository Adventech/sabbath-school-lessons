Ezekiel 21 predicted the comprehensive changes the Messiah would bring, saying, “Nothing shall remain the same” (v. 26) before describing how Jesus would break down barriers and reverse social expectations: “Exalt the humble, and humble the exalted.” Jesus began exalting the humble with His own mother, who said these words after her cousin proclaimed her blessed among women: “He has put down the mighty from their thrones, and exalted the lowly” (Luke 1:52). He also pronounced trouble for proud elites who were exalting themselves, mirroring the language seen in Ezekiel 21: “And whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted” (Matt. 23:12). The kingdom that Jesus introduced operates on principles that appear backward to people, exemplified in the simple statement, “The last will be first, and the first last” (Matt. 20:16).

God has not established an earthly government under His direct control since Israel, and nothing is more tyrannical than humans granting themselves their own charter to build an artificial theocracy. It would have been unthinkable for Moses or David to institute a theocracy based on their own authority. The nation of Israel respected the theocracy because they saw how God truly appeared to Moses on Mount Sinai. It is a total fraud for rulers today to claim theocratical kind of authority based on their own inventions or false revelations. Wherever this has happened it has resulted in the cruelest kind of religious tyranny. It’s important to note that God still appoints governments to punish evil and protect neighbor-to-neighbor relationships, but He does not appoint governments to enforce our allegiance to Him (Rom. 13:1–13).

The boundaries that should prevent governments from enforcing religious law can be found in the Old Testament as well. In Jeremiah 27:5–8, God explicitly commanded His people to submit to Babylon’s authority and Nebuchadnezzar’s rule. This submission was to be absolute, as long as Babylon did not interfere with their service to God. When Babylon’s laws conflicted with God’s laws, the people could no longer comply. This boundary is clearly illustrated in the story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, who chose to remain faithful to God when Nebuchadnezzar ordered them to worship his idol of gold (Dan. 3:12). The Jews were eager to defend their independence, but God instructed His people to submit to the authority of Babylon so far that it did not violate God’s law, which is always supreme.

The prophecy in Ezekiel 21 said the Messiah would overthrow old forms of government and introduce new principles, and Christ did just that. In places where these principles have been cast aside, tyranny, oppression, and overwhelming misery have been the result. The principles of religious liberty and separation of church and state that He taught have protected humanity’s happiness and strengthened civilization wherever they have been embraced.

Meditate on the primary passage again and look for where Jesus is.

`In what ways did Jesus overturn old power structures?`

`How do you see Jesus differently or see Him again?`
