  description: "These Sabbath School lessons have been written especially for you by people who care very much about you. They want you to know more about God and His love for you and your family. And that’s what God wants too. He wants you to know that He loves you very much. And Jesus wants to be your special, forever friend. He wants you to know Him, to know all about Him. He wants you to be His friend too."
