- **Feel**: Find courage in the call that has been placed upon the life of every believer to share the gospel.
- **Do**: Open his or her own heart to the gospel and recognize the places in which he or she can share it. 

**Learning Outline**:

1. Know: Circumstances Cannot Stop the Spread of the Gospel.
	+ What different circumstances did Paul go through that could have stopped him from spreading the gospel?
	+ What can stop the spread of the gospel in the life of an individual?

2. Feel: Find Courage to Share the Gospel.
	+ When have you found yourself too overwhelmed with life’s circumstances to share your faith in God? Talk a little bit about what that experience was like.
	+ How do these feelings limit the gospel?
	+ How can you take courage from Paul’s story?

3. Do: Be Open to the Gospel in Your Life and in the Lives of Others.
	+ Why is it important for believers to be open to the gospel in order for it to go forward?
	+ How might a believer discover an opening in another’s life in which the gospel can be shared? 

**Summary**: Acts ends with the story of Paul’s journey to Rome. He encounters many difficulties along the way, including being put in chains, surviving a shipwreck, and experiencing rejection by the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem. Paul perseveres through all this adversity in sharing the gospel. The one way the message is stopped is in the individual lives of those who reject it. 

### Learning Cycle

#### Step 1—Motivate

**Spotlight on Scripture**: Acts 27:24

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: Never stop sharing your faith, even when circumstances and rejection discourage you from doing so. Make sure that you are always open to the gospel in your own life and that you are looking for ways to share it with others. 

**Just for Teachers**: Throughout this lesson, your class members will have the chance to explore the limitations that there may be for the sharing of the gospel in each of their lives. It is important to recognize that the only limitation to the gospel is our willingness to share and another’s willingness to hear it. If we will share, there are always people who will listen, and life’s circumstances cannot stop the spread of the gospel.

**Opening Discussion**: One of the most limiting things for the gospel today is the openness of the people to the gospel message. This limiting factor holds true for both the believer who could share the message and for the listener who could receive it. One of the hindrances that, as a pastor, Cory would face with preaching the gospel was his own unworthiness. He would at times find himself in his office preparing for a sermon and think to himself, What right do I have to share this good news? My life is far from perfect. But Cory would turn this concern over to God in prayer and find the same answer again and again: Your unworthiness does not make the gospel unworthy of being heard. Imagine if Paul had given in to discouragement from the accusations of the unbelieving Jews or from the hardships that he faced. His witness could have been silenced, but he persevered and remained open to sharing the gospel. Even though the gospel may have been stopped at the doors of the hearts of those who rejected it, Paul continued to spread the gospel to those who would receive it.

**Questions for Discussion**:

1. What are the things that have stopped you from sharing your faith in the past?
2. Have you ever felt unworthy of sharing the gospel? Why, or why not?

#### Step 2—Explore

**Just for Teachers**: As you lead out in the study of the story of Paul’s journey to Rome, help your class to think through the various kinds of obstacles that they, too, might encounter in spreading the gospel.

**Bible Commentary**

In this final lesson, we will take a look at Paul’s difficult journey to Rome and the response of the Jewish leaders in Rome. The study will look at the different obstacles that Paul faced and the ways in which he persevered.

I. **The Difficulties of Paul’s Journey** (Review Acts 27:1–28:16 with your class.)

Paul has been held in Caesarea for two years as a prisoner. Both Felix and Festus have found Paul to be not guilty of any civil crime, but in order to escape the murderous intensions of the religious leaders in Jerusalem, Paul appeals to Caesar. It is finally time for Paul to begin that journey. This journey is a significant voyage of several hundred miles to be made by sea. This journey is made even more difficult by inclement weather conditions and the coming winter. The journey from Alexandria to Rome could take as little at 10 days, but with adverse conditions, this voyage could extend to 45 days. The wisdom of the day told sailors to avoid the sea from November through mid-March, and the slow progress of Paul and his fellow 275 shipmates meant they would need to stop for the winter. (See Darrel L. Bock, Acts: Baker Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament, p. 733.)

The port they were in was less than ideal. Most likely it was partially open to the sea, and therefore, the ship was not safe to stay in port. (See Darrel L. Bock, Acts: Baker Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament, p. 733.) Despite Paul’s warnings, the captain and the Roman centurion decide to try for the next port. This maneuver does not work, and the crew find themselves tossing cargo and ship tackle in order to survive as they are blown off course. The failed attempt to reach the next port shipwrecks them on the isle of Malta. After wintering with the friendly natives on the island, they crew makes it to port on another ship, only to have another 494 miles to travel before reaching Rome. (See Darrel L. Bock, Acts: Baker Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament, p. 745.)

**Discussion Questions**: 

1. What kind of travel hazards have you faced in your life?
2. How is the cause of sharing the gospel great enough for you to keep going? 
3. Have you ever made a difficult journey for the sake of the gospel?

II. **Paul’s Effort to Win Hearts on the Journey** (Review Acts 27:9-11, 21-26, 33-36; 28:3-6, 7-10 with your class.)

The circumstances of the journey were difficult enough. Paul, however, had other difficulties to face in the midst of the storm and the shipwreck. Paul, for the sake of the gospel, had to earn the trust of those with whom he was traveling. When the decision is to be made as to whether the ship should stay in the semi-safe port for the winter or move on, Paul counsels the centurion that if they try to continue the journey, it will not go well. The centurion does not listen to him. Once they are lost in the midst of the storm, the whole crew is more open to listening to Paul as he reminds them of his warning to them not to go in the first place.

Paul then steps into the role of the spiritual advisor for the whole ship, letting them know that an angel has appeared to him and said the ship will be lost, but not a single soul will perish. (See Darrel L. Bock, Acts: Baker Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament, p. 738.) Paul has won the centurion over enough so that the centurion is able to stop a plot by his soldiers to kill all the prisoners so they will not escape. After they are shipwrecked, the natives help to build fires. Paul throws some wood on the fire, and a viper latches onto his hand. The natives are sure that Paul is a murderer and will soon die. When Paul does not, however, the natives decide he must be a god. Then Paul heals the chief’s father and many others in the village. The natives are so grateful that they provide all that is needed to continue the journey to Rome. 

**Consider This**:

1. What kinds of things hold us back from trusting one another?
2. Suppose someone cannot trust the person who is sharing the gospel. What effect does that distrust have on the person listening to the gospel and that individual’s receptivity to the good news?
3. Which is easier to overcome when it comes to sharing the gospel: physical circumstances or matters of trust? Explain.

III. **Paul Meets With the Jewish Leaders in Rome** (Review Acts 28:17-31 with your class.)

Finally arriving in Rome, Paul is still in chains, most likely chained to a Roman guard, but apparently under house arrest. (See Darrel L. Bock, Acts: Baker Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament, p. 757.) People are allowed to come and visit with Paul, and the Jewish leaders accept the invitation. Paul presents the gospel to them. Letting them know that he has not broken any of their traditions but holds to the same hope as Israel (the resurrection of the dead), Paul presents Jesus Christ as the longed-for Messiah. Some of the leaders are convinced, and others are not. They leave Paul, arguing among themselves, and Paul quotes Isaiah 6:9, 10 to warn them of the hardness of their hearts. (See Darrel L. Bock, Acts: Baker Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament, pp. 754, 755.) He then declares the gospel of Jesus Christ to be unstoppable. Even if the Jews reject it, the message will go on to the Gentiles. Paul has made it to Rome, and he will testify to the highest officials of the land.

**Consider This**: 

1. Why is the gospel truly unstoppable? Does the rejection of the gospel cease its progress? Explain.
2. If Paul is martyred after testifying in Rome, does this mean that his testimony is stopped? Why, or why not?
3. What are the successes of the early church in sharing the gospel as related in the book of Acts? 

#### Step 3—Apply

**Just for Teachers**: The only obstacle that can actually stop the gospel is an individual’s refusal to accept it. It is essential to think through the obstacles of the heart for the sharer and the receiver.

**Application Questions**:

1.	What obstacles has the gospel faced in your own heart and mind?
2. How can understanding these “heart problems” help us in sharing the gospel with others?
3. What circumstantial obstacles have you seen the gospel overcome?

#### Step 4—Create

**Just for Teachers**: Do as many of the listed activities as time, space, supplies, and preference will allow. 

**Activities**:

1. Have your class act out the story of Paul’s journey to Rome for the next children’s story in your church.
2. Set up an obstacle course with different obstacles, representing Paul’s struggles.
3. Create a large painting of the shipwreck, using a bedsheet and house paint. 
4. What insights into Paul’s journey do these activities help you to find? How do these activities encourage you never to allow any obstacle to stop you from sharing your faith?
