**Summary**: In Acts 24-26, Paul defends himself and his faith three different times before three different groups of people. We learn from this what it might look like for each of us to stand up for ourselves and what we believe.

### Learning Cycle

#### Step 1—Motivate

**Spotlight on Scripture**: Acts 26:29

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: Being able to stand up for yourself in defense of the gospel is, at times, necessary and can be done respectfully. 

**Just for Teachers**: Help your class to identify the current moral or political issues that are relevant to their current context in whichever part of the world they live. Some of the issues mentioned below may not apply to your class’s context, so replace them with other relevant issues if you need to.

**Opening Discussion**: In today’s world, we often view “defending the faith” as standing up for specific political positions or moral issues. We say things such as, “Are you pro-life?” “Do you want prayer in schools?” “Shouldn’t our science curriculums include intelligent design?” “Make sure to write to your government representative so that you can voice your moral concern.” These statements and questions are all worth asking about and taking an active interest in. It seems, however, that too often, defending the Christian faith is transferred to holding these different positions. The lesson this week helps to draw us back to what it really means to defend the faith. Paul is being held in captivity, and when he gets his opportunity to speak, his goal is not to call out the moral inconsistencies of those who are governing (of which there are plenty). Instead, his goal is to present Jesus in such a way that those listening might become Christian as he is, minus the chains.

**Questions for Discussion**:

1. What are the moral/political positions in your country that Christians are “supposed” to defend?
2. In what ways are these positions similar to, or separate from, the gospel? 

#### Step 2—Explore

**Just for Teachers**: In the Greek, the term for defense is apologia. Paul gives three different apologias, or defenses, in these three chapters. Help your class to notice the differences in the defenses and to ask why Paul uses the different tactics that he does.

**Bible Commentary**

Paul is being held in captivity in Caesarea. He is called three different times to defend himself against the accusations of the Jewish leaders. Each time he defends himself, and in whatever way he finds possible, Paul also defends the gospel. Paul is first brought before Felix, then before Festus. Then Festus calls Paul before Agrippa and his sister Bernice.   

I. **Paul Brought Before Felix** (Review Acts 24:10-21 with your class.)

Paul has been brought from the holding cell in Jerusalem to Herod’s praetorium in Caesarea. Five days after his transfer, the Jewish leaders present themselves along with a legal representative to bring accusations against Paul. The accusations in general paint Paul as a troublemaker and disturber of the peace. The speech is made in legal rhetoric and meant to impress Felix with the seriousness of the charges brought against Paul. After listening to the accusations, Felix gives Paul the signal to speak in his own defense. Paul meets each challenge with a direct “apology,” which means defense. (See Darrel L. Bock, Acts: Baker Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament [Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2007], p. 692.) 

Paul in his defense asserts that he was not causing trouble in Jerusalem, but rather completing a religious rite of cleansing. Perhaps some of the Jews in Asia could have brought real accusations against him, but they are not there, and the current representatives have no evidence of their concerns. Paul is one of the first apologists, and defenders, of the Christian faith. In the second century, Christian defenders of the faith are called apologists. Men like Justin Martyr and Tertullian write letters to the members of the Roman government, defending Christians as model citizens who are not hurting the Roman government and should not be persecuted. Paul makes sure to demonstrate that he is not a civil troublemaker, but rather shows that the accusations from the Jews are over religious matters and not state concerns. 

**Discussion Questions**: 

1. In what ways might we make our own “apology,” or defense, today regarding Christians as ideal citizens?
2. Do Christians act in such a way as to validate this defense? Why, or why not?

II. **Paul Before Festus** (Review Acts 25:8-12 with your class.)

Felix returns Paul to prison, although he brings him before him several times in the next two years, hoping for a bribe. In order to continue with favor from the Jewish leaders, Felix leaves Paul in prison after he leaves office. Festus is the new proconsul, and before he comes to Caesarea, he visits Jerusalem to meet with the Jewish leaders. When they bring their concerns to him about Paul, Festus sees this matter as a possible political opportunity to garner favor with the Jews. He follows the Roman law and invites the Jewish leaders to present their case in Caesarea so that Paul may face his accusers. (See Darrel L. Bock, Acts: Baker Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament, p. 700.) The comments are abbreviated for this encounter, but the sentiments are the same. The Jews make the same accusations, and Paul once again defends himself. Festus, still trying for the political favor of the Jews, suggests that Paul go to Jerusalem for a trial. Paul refuses, knowing he will be killed, and instead appeals to the higher Roman court, to be taken to Caesar. Paul once again states his innocence, which Festus knows to be true; Festus thus determines that to Rome Paul will go. 

**Consider This**:

1. Why do you think Paul makes his appeal to Caesar now? Why didn’t he make it earlier?
2. What do you think the Lord’s message in Acts 23:11 has to do with Paul’s motivation to get to Rome?

III. **Paul Before Festus and Agrippa** (Review Acts 26 with your class.)

Festus knows that Paul is innocent, which complicates the matter of crafting the letter that Festus must send along with Paul to Rome. Because Festus doesn’t know what to write in the letter, he seeks advice from Agrippa. Paul is brought before Agrippa and Bernice, Agrippa’s sister. These are the grandchildren of Herod the Great, and some scholars suggest that they are incestuous lovers as well. (See Darrel L. Bock, Acts: Baker Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament, pp. 709, 710.) Paul could have gotten up to defend himself and called out the wrongs in the rulers’ lives, as John the Baptist once did with Herodias. But this is not his purpose. Paul is thrilled with the opportunity to share the gospel with Agrippa, knowing that he is a believer in the Old Testament prophets. This is Paul’s longest defense in Caesarea; he once again shares his testimony as he did in Jerusalem. Festus interrupts Paul, exclaiming that all of Paul’s education has made him crazy. Paul picks up his thread once again, defending both himself and his faith. He connects Christianity to its Jewish roots and the hope of the resurrection, demonstrated in Jesus. Paul uses such words as “us” and “our” to connect Agrippa with the truth and then wraps up his defense with a call for Agrippa to accept Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy. It is interesting the Paul does not call Jesus “Lord” in this context, but simply describes Him as the Resurrected One and therefore the center of the completed hope of Israel. (See Darrel L. Bock, Acts: Baker Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament, p. 714.)

**Consider This**: 

1. What is Agrippa’s response to Paul’s call for him to believe?
2. How does Festus respond to Paul’s testimony and reasoning?
3.	Why does Paul choose to add his testimony to his defense before Agrippa?

#### Step 3—Apply

**Just for Teachers**: For application of this lesson, it will be helpful to assist your class in recognizing their own testimonies as a defense of the Christian faith. It will also be important to help class members discover current contexts in which they might need to defend their faith for the purpose of sharing the gospel.

**Application Questions**:

1. What different ways are there for us to defend our faith?
2. What kinds of accusations regarding our faith do we face today? How are they similar to, or different from, Paul’s situation?
3. How can we use our testimonies as a defense for our faith?

#### Step 4—Create

**Just for Teachers**: Using Paul’s testimony before Herod as an example, help your class to craft and shape their own testimonies for the purpose of sharing the gospel. It would be good for you to do this yourself beforehand, so that you can give your students an example. Keep the steps that Paul used in mind: (1) What was your life like before you gave your life to Christ? (2) How did you encounter Christ? (3) How did your life change after you accepted Christ?

**Activities**:

1. Get into pairs of two and share your testimony with your partner.
2. Help each other to give shape to your testimonies in such a way that your testimonies give you the full opportunity to share the gospel and invite someone to accept that gospel.
3. In what ways might you need to make changes to your testimony for different situations?
4. In what way could you defend Christianity with this testimony?
5. Is there any room for logical argument within your testimony to strengthen it? If so, where?
