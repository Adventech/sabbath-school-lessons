#### Too Scared to Adopt 

_By SANG SOOK PARK_ 

Since I was a little girl, I wanted to adopt a child. The desire remained strong after I got married and raised a son, but I feared I wasn’t qualified. 

Finally, I filled out the paperwork. “Send me a child whom I can handle,” I prayed. “Give me this sign that the adopted child is fromYou: Make the first child I meet the one whom You want me to adopt.” 

This was my prayer for two and a half months. Then the orphanage sent a two-year-old girl, Bomin. But when she arrived, she just glared at me. I wanted to win her heart, so I gave her food and a doll. But she flung down the doll, and she wouldn’t allow me to touch her. I sent Bomin back to the orphanage. 

“I’m too scared to adopt,” I told my husband. 

But I sensed God saying, “What happened to all your prayers and request for a sign that the first child would be chosen by Me?” I wept and told God, “I’m too scared to live with this child.” 

But then I changed my prayer. “If I’m supposed to take this child, give me confidence and the assurance that You will raise her,” I prayed. “If I’m not supposed to adopt her, remove this heavy burden that I have to adopt a child.” 

I prayed this for five days. On the fifth day, I read 2 Samuel 24:14 during my devotions and realized that this was the answer. In this verse, King David says, “I am in great distress. Please let us fall into the hand of the Lord, for His mercies are great.” 

I remembered that God always had led me and I knew He would continue to care for my family with great mercy. I decided to fall into the hand of the Lord. 

“Let’s go get the child,” I told my husband. 

Tears streamed down my cheeks as we drove to the orphanage. I could still see those glaring eyes. Then I thought, Wait, I’m going to meet this precious daughter of mine. I prayed, “God, help us love her.” 

We waited a short time at the orphanage, and then Bomin entered the room. She quietly walked over to me and put her tiny hands into mine. It felt as if the Lord were holding my hands. I prayed, “I will lead this hand to heaven.” And we went home.
