**Key Text**: Acts 16:6-10; 18:9, 10 

**The Student Will**:

- **Know**: Recognize the cooperation between God and Paul in their missionary work: God encourages Paul and directs him as to where he should minister, and Paul shares and fine-tunes the gospel message according to his diverse audiences.   
- **Feel**: Sense the thrill and confidence in knowing God was present every time he or she shared the gospel.
- **Do**: Move confidently but sensitively in his or her respective mission fields.

**Learning Outline**:

I.	Know: A Thrilling Partnership
	+ Even though God granted Paul visions for direction and encouragement, what do we have that can give us both of those elements?

II.	Feel: Never Alone
	+ Like Paul and Silas singing to God in the Philippian jail, how can we feel that close to God in difficult settings, missionary or otherwise?
	+ Which part of Paul’s second missionary journey particularly motivates you and gives you the confidence to follow in his footsteps?

III.	Do: Just Go.
	+ What is the top reason you can think of right now that keeps you from actively sharing your faith in Christ?
	+ Whatever the above answer may be, why not pray with a friend that God would remove such an obstacle?

**Summary**: Knowing we are co-workers with God can move us from fear or lack of confidence to courage in sharing the gospel. In addition, we can learn principles of sharing from the record of Paul’s mission trips. 

### Learning Cycle

#### Step 1—Motivate

**Spotlight on Scripture**: Acts 16:1-4, 22-24

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: Paul’s second mission trip is worth our attention for at least two reasons: (1) that he continued to labor under extreme circumstances is motivating, and (2) how he ministered to diverse audiences is instructive.    

**Just for Teachers**: Paul’s second missionary journey is filled with a fascinating array of diverse experiences: exorcisms, quiet witnessing on a riverside, beatings, conversions, rejections, public evangelism, jail time, chaotic mob attacks, and so on. There’s a tendency to assess God’s presence and His will in our lives based on a spectrum of good or bad results. The chronicle of Paul’s exploits challenges that notion and shows that we, like Paul, can be at the center of God’s will, and yet still be undergoing horrendous challenges and outright pain. Share the story below, and afterward reinforce that, as much as we like to see ourselves as the wise old man, we instinctively respond like the neighbors.   

**Opening Discussion**: An ancient parable tells of an old man whose horse escaped from his stables. His neighbors came to console him. “Such bad luck,” they bemoaned. But the old man seemed unaffected and replied, “Whether it is a bad or good thing, I cannot tell.” A bit confused, the neighbors went home. Later that afternoon, the neighbors returned upon hearing the news that the escaped stallion had returned, bringing with it a herd of horses that filled the old man’s stalls. “What amazing good luck you have,” gushed the neighbors. The old man again mused, “Whether it is a bad or good thing, I cannot tell.” Again, the neighbors went home, only to return later to console the man because his son had injured his foot riding one of the new horses. The neighbors and the old man exchanged the same metaphysical reflections as before over the latest happening. Finally, the local army marched through town, compelling all able-bodied young men to join them in a dangerous tribal assault. The old man’s son was exempt because of his injury. The neighbors once again returned and congratulated the old man’s good fortune, but of course, they were met again with a wisdom they did not possess.           

**Questions for Discussion**:

1. Imagine being Paul’s companion and having the “neighbors’” mentality; how long do you think you would last on any of his mission trips?
2. Do we have to nuance our description of God’s character to accommodate the fact that He allowed Paul to be stripped and beaten with rods (Acts 16:22)?

#### Step 2—Explore

**Just for Teachers**: This lesson engages two relatively different themes in Paul’s experience: (1) reflection on the hardships he endured and (2) an underlying strategy of missions he used. Feel free to focus on one or both of these themes. Thus far, Paul’s personal trials have been the topic. For the sake of keeping in biblical sequence, his missionary strategy will be discussed first in the Bible Commentary section, followed by the difficulties he endured.    

**Bible Commentary**

I. **Removing Unnecessary Obstacles** (Review Acts 16:1-5 with the class.)

The irony is conspicuous as one moves from the circumcision verdict of the Jerusalem Council (Acts 15:19, 20) to the very next mention of circumcision (Acts 16:3). With a letter nullifying the need for the covenantal rite in one hand, and a cutting instrument in the other, Paul performs Timothy’s circumcision. The reason given is “because of the Jews” (Acts 16:3). It was one matter to release believing Gentiles from circumcision, but an entirely different matter to release Jews themselves from the ancient rite. Paul, on the other hand, personally holds circumcision as a non-issue, repeating in multiple letters that neither circumcision nor uncircumcision “counts for anything” (1 Cor. 7:19, Gal. 5:6, 6:15). However, Paul certainly doesn’t want the reputation of being someone who told the Jews “not to circumcise their children” (Acts 21:21). 

But right here, at the nexus of theological conviction and missionary practice, Paul shows that he is ever cognizant and considerate of the convictions of his audience. With an assumed recognition of essentials and nonessentials, Paul invokes a criterion of offense in a number of issues. Paul and Timothy clearly believe circumcision unnecessary, but for the sake of not offending their target audience, they comply with convictions other than their own. Should one eat food offered to idols? Theologically, Paul knows that “an idol is nothing” and admits that one is no “better” if they eat or “worse” if they abstain from such food (1 Cor. 8:4, 8). However, not all Christians are convinced, so Paul explicates that it is not what you eat, but whom you eat with, that becomes determinative (Romans 14). 

Being sensitive to another’s conscience, not unilaterally exercising your own convictions, not being a stumbling block—these are the considerations that undergirded the effective ministry of the apostle Paul.   

**Consider This**: Timothy deserves recognition too. He was the one who endured real physical pain for the sake of simply not offending fellow Jews. Can you think of analogous ways Timothy’s example needs to be followed today?  

II. **Finding Providence in Chaos** (Review Acts 18:9, 10; 2 Cor. 11:16-29 with the class.)

We have no doubt that God accompanied Paul throughout his missionary journeys. If Paul had had any doubt, it would have dissipated before God’s visionary affirmation, “ ‘I am with you,’ ” which Paul received in Corinth (Acts 18:10, ESV). This unadorned construction of God being “with” someone is a hallmark of divine intimacy and providence. Jacob’s son Joseph is abused by “the patriarchs,” but Stephen reassures that “God was with him” (Acts 7:9). Peter’s explanation to Cornelius and his family of Jesus’ miraculous healing power and good works was that “God was with him” (Acts 10:38). Like bookends in the New Testament, Jesus comes as Emmanuel, that is, “God with us” (Matt. 1:23), and foreshadows the eternal new heaven and new earth, where “God himself shall be with them” (Rev. 21:3).     

But what can one expect in a “with God” life? Does such partnership convey special protection, divine leading, or inner peace? Perhaps all three, but note Paul’s summary of what his “with God” ministry included: five whippings, each including 40 lashes minus one; or put another way, 200 lashes minus five, totaling one 195 lashes; three beatings with rods; one stoning; three shipwrecks, including a night and day adrift at sea; multiple dangers; sleeplessness; hunger; thirst; cold and nakedness (2 Cor. 11:24-27) . . . and eventually martyrdom.

The extensive description of Paul’s life in Acts, a life which is known to be under the care of God, provides opportunity to rightly align our expectations of Christian service with the reality of a “with God” life. First, it should be noted that Paul’s extensive suffering does not negate the personal protective care of God. Unfortunately, we are mostly ignorant of the events that God prevents. It is interesting to note that God did promise Paul in Corinth that “ ‘no one will attack you to harm you’ ” (Acts 18:10, ESV). Letting Paul’s wounds from Philippi heal and providing a psychological reprieve from—by today’s standards—torture shows that God can, and does, set limits on suffering (compare with Job 1:12, 2:6). 

Second, suffering can serve greater ends. Paul’s beatings and imprisonment in Philippi led to the conversion of an unnamed Roman jailer and his family. Additionally, Paul’s afflictions set up a chain of events that led Roman magistrates to apologize to a Christian apostle (Acts 16:39). In effect, Caesar paid homage to Christ. Last, suffering can serve to authenticate our commitment to Christ. Paul recounts a litany of sufferings that he endured, defending his ministry against the attacks of false apostles (2 Cor. 11:13-29). Words are cheap, and religious profession can be transient. Jesus predicted that “rocky ground” hearers who immediately and joyously receive the “word of the kingdom” can just as readily “fall away” when tribulation or persecution arises. Inversely, enduring tribulations would serve to prove authenticity. Paul passes the test, and by God’s grace, we will too.            

**Discussion Questions**: How would you answer someone who felt that trials were the result of God’s displeasure?   

#### Step 3—Apply

**Just for Teachers**: Pain and suffering in the world is the number one fact used to deny the existence of God. Though Christians may not succumb to that exact argument, they may similarly deny God’s presence in their lives because of pain and suffering. Communicate to the class that suffering is a complex issue and that we should be slow to assume that suffering means being abandoned by God.

**Application Question**:

How many reasons for suffering can you think of, and how is God involved in each case?

#### Step 4—Create

**Just for Teachers**: If the mood is right, foster an environment of vulnerability in which you volunteer first to do the activity below. 

**Activity**:

Share an experience of personal suffering that you now see differently in light of God’s providence.
