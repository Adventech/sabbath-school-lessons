#### “Just Go!” 

_By ANDREW MCCHESNEY, Adventist Mission_ 

Kiyong Kwon, owner of a private accounting business, is known in South Korea for leading more people to Christ than perhaps any Seventh-day Adventist pastor. But he almost didn’t. 

The story started in late 2000 when Kwon began to study Bible prophecy. He realized with new urgency that each prophecy in Daniel had been fulfilled except Jesus’ second coming. He wondered what Noah would do if he were alive today. Perhaps Noah, regardless of his career, would dedicate his life to a single mission: to proclaim Jesus’ return. Kwon grew convinced that he should devote his life to proclaiming Jesus’ return by becoming a church planter. 

One morning as he prayed, he felt God say, “Just go!” The command scared him. He began giving excuses: “I don’t have any experience. I am not a pastor. I’m already 40. I’m afraid I’ll fail.” 

“But every morning God’s calling was so clear that it was painful for me,” Kwon said. 

So, he prayed, “If You really want me to go, show me what to do from beginning to end. Then I’ll go.” 

Kwon thought this was a reasonable prayer, but he didn’t receive an answer. He prayed for seven days straight. On the seventh day, after praying, he opened Church Compass, the magazine of the Adventist Church’s Korean Union Conference. He saw a quotation from the book Life Sketches of Ellen 

G. White that shocked him. It read: “God will have men who will venture anything and everything to save souls. Those who will not move until they can see every step of the way clearly before them, will not be of advantage at this time to forward the truth of God. There must be workers now who will push ahead in the dark as well as in the light, and who will hold up bravely under discouragements and disappointed hopes, and yet work on with faith, with tears and patient hope, sowing beside all waters, trusting the Lord to bring the increase. God calls for men of nerve, of hope, faith, and endurance, to work to the point” (pages 213, 214). 

“That was my answer from God!” he said. “I was not supposed to pray to know what to do from the beginning to the end. I had to push ahead.” 

Kwon gave up and planted a church. “Surprisingly,” he said, “I didn’t have to do anything. When God works, there are miracles.”
