**Key Text**: Acts 20:24

**The Student Will**:

- **Know**: Meditate on the fact that Paul was willing to sacrifice life itself for the sake of spreading the gospel of God’s kingdom.
- **Feel**: Appreciate that Paul discovered his life’s purpose in service to God. Yearn for the Spirit to show him or her the same. 
- **Do**: Pursue God’s call on his or her life with focused energy and invoke Paul’s memory if the sacrifices to be made feel too great. 

**Learning Outline**:

I. **Know: Paul Never Gave Up.**
	+ Can we be as sure of our ministry calling as Paul was even though he had visions and we may not? 
	+ If most of our ministry is in the workplace, how can we still apply Paul’s worldwide ministry strategies to our own situation?

II.	**Feel**: Singularity of Purpose
	+ Why is it realistic to think happiness could be found in pursuing a life like Paul’s?
	+ How would you explain to a nonbelieving family that sacrifices for ministry are worth it?

III. **Do**: No Regrets
	+ Thinking of all who know you, what steps must you take so you could testify as Paul did to the Ephesians, “I am innocent of the blood of all, for I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God” (Acts 20:26, 27, ESV)?

**Summary**: Paul’s third missionary journey was fraught with obstacles and forebodings of future affliction, but Paul steadfastly performed his mission and expressed that even death could not deter him.     

### Learning Cycle

#### Step 1—Motivate

**Spotlight on Scripture**: Acts 19:11-16, 23-28

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: The enemies of the kingdom of God are in full display in Paul’s last missionary campaign. Despite the secular and spiritual forces arrayed against Paul in Ephesus, the “word of the Lord” sweeps through Asia (Acts 19:10). Money, magic, paganism, and politics cannot halt the spread of the gospel or deflate the gospel messenger, who is ready to surrender his life “ ‘for the name of the Lord Jesus’ ” (Acts 21:13, NKJV).    

**Just for Teachers**: The following extended missionary story shows that even in this day and age, God can and does work miracles, especially when divine miracles serve to undercut peoples’ reliance on magic or pagan systems of worship.  

**Opening Discussion**: The late Bill Liversidge told of his mission experience among an unreached and dangerous tribe near Papua New Guinea. Reuben, a young man and the only convert to Christianity from that tribe, accompanied Bill to the island during the night, but they were quickly caught by the tribesmen. They were allowed to spend the night with the expectation that they would be kicked off the island the next morning. After sleeping a bit, they heard a call ring out in the jungle, “You fella seven day, you fella come!” The tribe was calling for Bill and Reuben, the Seventh-day Adventists. Bill sent Reuben to find out what was going on. Reuben returned and relayed that almost everyone on the island was all together in the village, because a young mother’s 18-month-old child was sick with the “fever,” that is, malaria. Bill thought realistically, “That’s not unusual.” With a 70 percent child mortality rate, though, children were dying all the time from malaria. But Reuben continued excitedly, “Usually, the witch doctor would be there with all his magic and potions, but this mother has called out for the two Christians who arrived in the middle of the night to come and pray to their God.” They enthusiastically made their way to the village, realizing that God had opened a door. However, their hopes of a potential healing were soon dashed as they approached the crowd of villagers and heard the chaotic wailing and grieving. They were too late. A young “doctor” boy, who worked out of a makeshift clinic, informed them that the child had died 20 minutes earlier. Disappointed and questioning God, Bill planned on offering condolences to the mother. Perhaps God had intended him to perform a Christian funeral. Suddenly, Reuben lunged forward and gently took the lifeless child out of the mother’s hands and held it straight above his little body. Bill stood dumbfounded. The entire village became silent as all eyes locked on Reuben. And then Reuben did an unexpected thing. He prayed. “Papa, You touch all You put’n life long this fella pikinini, You kisim kambek.” [Translation: You’re the giver of life. You’re the One who has taken life back.]  “Now Papa, long-high up him, name belong You [in order to glorify You] kisimi kambek [bring life back].” The two dangling legs of the child started to flicker with life. The mother ran to her crying child and stared at him with utter amazement. The whole island became Seventh-day Adventist as a result.       

**Question for Discussion**:

Why do you think God works miraculously in some instances and not in others?

#### Step 2—Explore

**Just for Teachers**: The trio of paganism, magic, and money are often present today just as they were 2000 years ago. Exploit this fact to show how relevant the Bible remains as you study the following.

**Bible Commentary**

I. **Miracles Versus Magic** (Review Acts 19:11-20 with the class.)

Sadly, it is not uncommon today to find many world religion courses trying persuasively to convince the reader that the miracles wrought by, and through, Peter and Paul were no different than that of other shaman/pagan traditions, and therefore should be properly termed magic. There are similarities: both divine miracles and magic channel power from an unseen world; both often use touch or words to harness spiritual forces, produce extraordinary results such as healing or special knowledge, et cetera. Understanding the differences between authentic divine miracles and magic will benefit Christians engaged with cultures influenced by spiritualistic and occult practices.

The supernatural healing power investing Paul’s ministry stands in stark contrast to the Jewish exorcists’ attempts. The contrast was not to be missed. So potent was Paul’s healing gift that even “handkerchiefs or aprons” (Acts 19:12) that had touched his skin could heal the sick who received the articles. These extraordinary feats motivate the Jewish competitors’ mimicry of Paul. Their utter failure and consequent abuse by the demons provided an unintentional endorsement of Paul and his mission, resulting in “the name of the Lord Jesus [being] magnified” (Acts 19:17). Furthermore, the fact that “believers” themselves burned their books of magic showed that syncretistic practices in Ephesus could have infected the high priest’s sons as well.      

This exorcism account demonstrates the most fundamental principle of Christian supernaturalism that differentiates Christian supernaturalism from all other forms of supernaturalism. That principle in one word is intent. When the Jewish exorcists invoked the name of “Jesus whom Paul proclaims” (Acts 19:13, ESV), their subject may have been released, but only at the expense of the exorcists themselves being demonically subjugated. The demons maintained control and the name of Jesus proved impotent in that incident. Why? Because these Jewish healers had not personally aligned their lives with the gospel of God by exercising faith in the Lord Jesus; therefore, their intentions were out of sync with the Messianic-kingdom movement Paul announced. They could speak of Jesus only secondhanded, that is, as the one “whom Paul proclaims” (Acts 19:13, ESV, emphasis author’s). The name “Jesus” is meaningless as a talisman or incantation. 

Peter’s words to Simon are relevant here. Simon the (ex)sorcerer, though baptized, offered money to be able to affect the Holy Spirit and was discerningly rebuked: “ ‘You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not right before God ” (Acts 8:21, ESV). The heart, the intent, the motive, all come to bear on whether God does “extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul” or anyone else (Acts 19:11, ESV).

It should be noted that none of the points thus far negate the reality that supernatural evil can be mediated through humans. It can. But the assurance of the believer is found in God’s unquestionable authority and power. Even though Pharaoh’s magicians could turn rods into snakes, they couldn’t prevent them from being consumed by God’s snake (Exod. 7:12). God’s “snake” always wins.

These occasions exhibit the marked contrast between magical practices that appease or manipulate spiritual forces and the miraculous practices of the New Testament church as the body of Christ, carrying on His healing/prophetic/kingdom ministry.

**Consider This**: New Age philosophies are still popular in the West, where Jesus is just another wise sage, side by side with other religious figures. How would you explain to a New Age friend the uniqueness of Christ and His kingdom? 

II. **Money Matters** (Review Acts 19:23-27 with the class.)

Curiously, money often plays a role in pagan interests, and both Peter and Paul were acquainted with this unholy alliance. (To this day, money and the occult are often tied together. When was the last time you heard a fortune-teller offer free services? Compare that to ever hearing a Christian offer prayer for cash.) The exorcism narrative ends with the Ephesians choosing God over magic and money as they watch an extraordinarily costly collection of magic books go up in smoke (Acts 19:19, 20). This foreshadows the next narrative in which pagan and economic interests again confront and react against the threat of the gospel. A mob ensues but fizzles, and Paul moves on to Macedonia (Acts 19:21-20:1). Though this account is often correctly characterized as a selfish pagan fearing the loss of his idol-manufacturing business, other points can be made. It is important to realize that in some circumstances, converts to Christ must sacrifice income sources and sometimes make entire career changes as a result of their faith. Especially as Sabbathkeeping Adventists, we as a church can be sensitive to these economic challenges as we guide and provide for those in transition.  

**Consider This**: What do you think Paul would have said to the mob that shouted, “ ‘Great is Artemis of the Ephesians’ ”  (Acts 19:28, ESV) for two hours if he had had a chance to speak?

#### Step 3—Apply

**Just for Teachers**: Depending on your location, magic and paganism will have different cultural influences. Comment and adapt your questions specifically to address your class’s context.   

**Application Questions**:

1. How could you help a fellow believer who was participating in syncretistic “Christian” magic?
2. What assurance could you give to someone who fears economic collapse upon his or her conversion?  

#### Step 4—Create

**Just for Teachers**: Testimonies such as in the following activity suggested below can be a blessing or an embarrassment if someone takes up all the class time. Gently guide the discussion to keep it appropriate and within limits.  

**Activity**:

Many of us can testify to a supernatural experience involving God or the devil. Share a short, edifying story of God’s power over evil.
