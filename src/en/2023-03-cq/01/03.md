Because Satan lives and breathes to slander the name and character of God, he taught the pagan nations that God was easily angered and that He was pleased by pain and blood. Millions thought they were learning theology when in fact they were learning demonology from their false prophets and teachers. The truth is that God was never pleased with the blood of animals (Isa. 1:11), and He abhors human sacrifice (Lev. 18:21) and the consuming of blood, which was common among the pagan religions of the time (Lev. 19:26). The God of heaven brings life and joy (John 10:10). Death and sorrow come from sin and Satan (John 8:44).

That still leaves the question of why the sacrificial system was necessary. Here are three reasons: First, to teach humanity the real and horrible consequences of sin, which hurts not only the one participating but also many others. It is like a grenade; it hurts everyone around it. The truth is that all of us have been victims and victimizers of sins. Our sins hurt God, our fellow human beings, and even the nature around us (Rom. 8:19–23). When sinners appeared at the temple with their sacrifices, the priest would hand them the knife, and they themselves were required to quickly take the life of the animal by cutting its throat. This must have been extremely difficult, since these animals were often part of the offeror’s own livestock and were probably loved (Lev. 1:2).

Second, the sacrificial system was necessary to stir the heart toward repentance, which simply means “a changed mind.” In other words, as the sinner better understood the horrible results of their sin, they would begin to change their mind about it. They saw it for what it is: a real predator of innocence, purity, peace, love, joy, unity, and life. For this reason, when we teach the cross of Christ, people are moved to “change their mind” about sin. They are moved by the Holy Spirit! In fact, repentance is a gift from Jesus to those who behold the cross (Acts 5:31).

Third, God had made a promise to the human family that He would send His Son to die in their place (Gen. 3:15). Every sacrifice pointed to this great event; they were a daily reminder that Jesus would come to die and that their sins would be forgiven through His blood. Therefore, when Jesus died on Calvary, the sacrificial system no longer had any meaning and was abandoned forever. In other words, it was allowed to continue only until the Messiah had completely fulfilled the purpose of it (1 John 2:1–3).

Unlike the pagan religions, the Israelite sacrifices were not to appease a bloodthirsty and angry god; they instead pointed forward to a God who “so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life” (John 3:16). Paganism teaches that a sacrifice had to be made for God to love us. Christianity teaches that God Himself became the sacrifice because He loves you! Unlike the pagan religions, the Israelites were taught to identify God’s love in the sacrificial services and, as a result, to live in a way that honored the One who died for them. In other words, the sacrificial system moved them to repentance, not sinful revelry.
