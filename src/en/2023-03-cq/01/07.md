`How were Israel’s sacrificial services different from the pagan ones?`

`What would you say to help someone who was struggling with why God would create such a system of sacrifices?`

`What step do you need to take today in your relationship with God?`

`If you were an Israelite living in the days of Leviticus, what would be the hardest part about approaching God with your sins? What would you say is the hardest part of approaching God today?`
