`What do Leviticus 18 and 20 tell you about God and His care for your sexuality?`

`Why did God highlight so many misuses of sexuality? Whom is He protecting?`

`How is this chapter countercultural to us today? What does this mean for the church in the long run?`

`How can a young person overcome sexual temptation?`

`What responsibility do we have to protect others from sexual abuse?`

`How did Jesus minister to people who struggled with sexual sins and lifestyles?`

`How can we help each other live sexually pure lives in this world?`

`If a friend of yours was struggling with God’s condemnation of certain lifestyle in Leviticus 18, what questions might he or she have and how would you answer them?`
