Share insights from this week’s memory verse and Bible study as well as any discoveries, observations, and questions with your Sabbath School class (or Bible study group). Consider these discussion questions with the rest of the group.

`How should the knowledge that your relationship with God has been completely restored influence your daily life?`

`What does it mean to be not only God’s creation but His friend as well?`

`What sins do you need to lay at Jesus’ feet today? What sins have you been holding on to, perhaps out of guilt or shame?`

`What can we do if we no longer recognize our consciences’ proddings when we sin? What steps can we take to begin hearing the proverbial alarm again?`

`How much should we rely on the Holy Spirit to convict us when we're sinning? Can we rely on Him alone, or are there other steps we should take to recognize sin?`

`What would you do if someone you trust tried to convict you of a sin you're not guilty of?`

`Why is it so important to confess our specific sins?`
