Share insights from this week’s memory verse and Bible study as well as any discoveries, observations, and questions with your Sabbath School class (or Bible study group). Consider these discussion questions with the rest of the group.

`Is there a difference between biblical and secular activism? What are those differences, and what role does the law of God play in your answer?`

`How can young Adventists live and lead in a way that displays the beauty of God’s character as revealed in the Ten Commandments?`

`What are the three types of laws found in Leviticus, and how should each impact us today?`

`How should the law of God be used, and how should it not be used?`

`How is it not contradictory to teach that salvation is by grace through faith in Jesus, not by lawkeeping, while also teaching that we should obey God’s law?`

`Have you gained victory over a particular sin? How did you do it, and how would you encourage someone who desperately wants to be free to do the same?`
