  title: "The Book of Leviticus"
  description: "Recently, I shared with a friend that I was writing the inVerse lessons on the book of Leviticus. I told him I was really enjoying the study. He smiled and said, “That’s good, but why not just skip it and read the New Testament? Doesn’t it all point to Jesus anyway?” As I thought about his comments, I was quite impressed. My friend, who may have never read the book of Leviticus, understood correctly that the book points unapologetically to Jesus. In fact, every book in the Bible does! Leviticus is like a gospel puzzle book—the more you read it, the better you get at seeing Jesus and understanding the depth of the plan of salvation. If that isn’t motivation enough to study Leviticus, here are six other important aspects of this Pentateuchal book."
