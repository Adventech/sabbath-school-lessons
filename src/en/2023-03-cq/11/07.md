Share insights from this week’s memory verse and Bible study as well as any discoveries, observations, and questions with your Sabbath School class (or Bible study group). Consider these discussion questions with the rest of the group.

`Have we minimized sin in the church today? What does the Day of Atonement teach us about sin?`

`Is there a need for more solemnity in the church today? If so, what would that look or sound like?`

`What aspect of Christ’s work in the Most Holy Place do you appreciate the most?`

`How can we be conquerors over sin and why is this important if salvation is not by works?`

`How is the Day of Atonement good news for those who want to see justice prevail?`

`How does the Day of Atonement help us be more balanced in our Christian activism?`

`Like Jesus, are you praying for your enemies?`
