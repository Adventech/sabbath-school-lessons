Share insights from this week’s memory verse and Bible study as well as any discoveries, observations, and questions with your Sabbath School class (or Bible study group). Consider these discussion questions with the rest of the group.

`How does the fact that you are a minister make you feel?`

`What ministry opportunities are available or need to be created in your church or community?`

`Has God been calling you to a particular ministry? If so, explain.`

`How high is God’s standard for His priests and ministers?`

`In what ways does God empower us to be all that He wants us to be in ministry?`

`How dependent are you and your church on your pastor?`

`How might God be calling you to assist your pastor in local church ministry?`

`What kind of ministry training is offered at your church? What training do you wish you had?`

`What do you think would happen if every local church released all its pastors to go and raise up new congregations, as the Adventist Church used to do? How would your church fare? In that event, what responsibilities would you take on?`
