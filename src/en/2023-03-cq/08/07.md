`In what ways is our experience with God more dynamic today than it was in Israel’s day?`

`What would you say to someone who believes there are many paths to God?`

`Although as Christians we don’t need to keep the feast days, what can we learn from each of them?`

`How does knowing that God is king, sits on the throne, and rules from the temple in heaven give you courage and confidence today?`

`How do you personally worship God?`

`How has the meaning of worship changed after this study?`
