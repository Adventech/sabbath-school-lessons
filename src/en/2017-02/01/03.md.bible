One of the grand moments in the story of Jesus occurred in a dialogue with Peter. Jesus just had been dealing with some of the scribes and Pharisees who had been challenging Him to give them a sign, something to prove who He was (see <a class="verse" verse="Matt 16:1–4">Matt. 16:1–4</a>). Then, later, alone with the disciples, Jesus talked about the two miracles He had performed, in which He twice fed thousands with just a few loaves and fish. He did all this in the context of warning the disciples about the “leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees” (<a class="verse" verse="Matt 16:11">Matt. 16:11</a>).

`Read <a class="verse" verse="Matthew 16:13–17">Matthew 16:13–17</a>. What is happening here? What is the significance of Peter’s words to Jesus?`

Peter here spoke boldly of his faith in Jesus. And it’s clear from <a class="verse" verse="Matthew 16:20">Matthew 16:20</a> that his confession of Christ as the Messiah was shared by the others, as well. This was to be a turning point in the ministry of Jesus, even though the disciples, including Peter, had much more to learn.

“The disciples still expected Christ to reign as a temporal prince. Although He had so long concealed His design, they believed that He would not always remain in poverty and obscurity; the time was near when He would establish His kingdom. That the hatred of the priests and rabbis would never be overcome, that Christ would be rejected by His own nation, condemned as a deceiver, and crucified as a malefactor,—such a thought the disciples had never entertained.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 415.

As soon as the disciples recognize Jesus as the Messiah, Jesus begins teaching that He must suffer and die (see <a class="verse" verse="Matt 16:21–23">Matt. 16:21–23</a>), a concept that Peter could not accept. Peter goes as far as to “rebuke” Jesus. Jesus then turns to Peter and says, “ ‘Get behind Me, Satan’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="Matt 16:23">Matt. 16:23</a>, NKJV). This is one of the harshest things that He said to anybody during His ministry; yet, He did it for Peter’s own good. Peter’s words reflected his own desires, his own selfish attitude about what he wanted. Jesus had to stop him in his tracks, right then and there (and though Jesus was really speaking to Satan, Peter got the message). Peter needed to learn that serving the Lord would involve suffering. That he learned this lesson is clear in his later writings (see <a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 4:12">1 Pet. 4:12</a>).

`How often do your personal desires clash with what you know God wants you to do? How do you decide what to do in those situations?`
