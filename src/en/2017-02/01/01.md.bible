            'Luke 22:31–34, 54–62': '<h3> <span>Luke 22:31-34</span></h3><p><span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>And the Lord said, <span>&#x201C;Simon, Simon! Indeed, Satan has asked for you, that he may sift <i>you</i> as wheat.</span> </span> <span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup><span>But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail; and when you have returned to <i>Me,</i> strengthen your brethren.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>But he said to Him, &#x201C;Lord, I am ready to go with You, both to prison and to death.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>Then He said, <span>&#x201C;I tell you, Peter, the rooster shall not crow this day before you will deny three times that you know Me.&#x201D;</span></span></p><h3> <span>Luke 22:54-62</span></h3><p><span><sup>54&#xA0;</sup>Having arrested Him, they led <i>Him</i> and brought Him into the high priest&#x2019;s house. But Peter followed at a distance. </span> <span><sup>55&#xA0;</sup>Now when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them. </span> <span><sup>56&#xA0;</sup>And a certain servant girl, seeing him as he sat by the fire, looked intently at him and said, &#x201C;This man was also with Him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>57&#xA0;</sup>But he denied Him, saying, &#x201C;Woman, I do not know Him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>58&#xA0;</sup>And after a little while another saw him and said, &#x201C;You also are of them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>But Peter said, &#x201C;Man, I am not!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>59&#xA0;</sup>Then after about an hour had passed, another confidently affirmed, saying, &#x201C;Surely this <i>fellow</i> also was with Him, for he is a Galilean.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>60&#xA0;</sup>But Peter said, &#x201C;Man, I do not know what you are saying!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed. </span> <span><sup>61&#xA0;</sup>And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had said to him, <span>&#x201C;Before the rooster crows,</span><span> you will deny Me three times.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>62&#xA0;</sup>So Peter went out and wept bitterly.</span></p>'
            'Matthew 14:30, 31': '<h3> <span>Matthew 14:30</span></h3><p> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>But when he saw that the wind <i>was</i> boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried out, saying, &#x201C;Lord, save me!&#x201D;</span></p><h3> <span>Matthew 14:31</span></h3><p><span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>And immediately Jesus stretched out <i>His</i> hand and caught him, and said to him, <span>&#x201C;O you of little faith, why did you doubt?&#x201D;</span> </span> </p>'
            'Gal 2:9, 11–14': '<h3> <span>Galatians 2:9</span></h3><p> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>and when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that had been given to me, they gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we <i>should go</i> to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised. </span> </p><h3> <span>Galatians 2:11-14</span></h3><p><span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>Now when Peter had come to Antioch, I withstood him to his face, because he was to be blamed; </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>for before certain men came from James, he would eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>And the rest of the Jews also played the hypocrite with him, so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy.</span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before <i>them</i> all, &#x201C;If you, being a Jew, live in the manner of Gentiles and not as the Jews, why do you compel Gentiles to live as Jews? </span> </p>'
            'Matt 16:13–17': '<h3> <span>Matthew 16:13-17</span></h3><p><span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, saying, <span>&#x201C;Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>So they said, &#x201C;Some <i>say</i> John the Baptist, some Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>He said to them, <span>&#x201C;But who do you say that I am?&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>Simon Peter answered and said, &#x201C;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>Jesus answered and said to him, <span>&#x201C;Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed <i>this</i> to you, but My Father who is in heaven.</span> </span> </p>'
            'Matt 14:22–33': '<h3> <span>Matthew 14:22-33</span></h3><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>Immediately Jesus made His disciples get into the boat and go before Him to the other side, while He sent the multitudes away. </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>And when He had sent the multitudes away, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray. Now when evening came, He was alone there. </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.</span></p><p><span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>Now in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea. </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>And when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, &#x201C;It is a ghost!&#x201D; And they cried out for fear.</span></p><p><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, <span>&#x201C;Be of good cheer! It is I; do not be afraid.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>And Peter answered Him and said, &#x201C;Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>So He said, <span>&#x201C;Come.&#x201D;</span> And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to go to Jesus. </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>But when he saw that the wind <i>was</i> boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried out, saying, &#x201C;Lord, save me!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>And immediately Jesus stretched out <i>His</i> hand and caught him, and said to him, <span>&#x201C;O you of little faith, why did you doubt?&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.</span></p><p><span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>Then those who were in the boat came and worshiped Him, saying, &#x201C;Truly You are the Son of God.&#x201D;</span></p>'
            'Luke 5:1–11': '<h3> <span>Luke 5:1-11</span></h3><p><span><span>5&#xA0;</span>So it was, as the multitude pressed about Him to hear the word of God, that He stood by the Lake of Gennesaret, </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>and saw two boats standing by the lake; but the fishermen had gone from them and were washing <i>their</i> nets. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>Then He got into one of the boats, which was Simon&#x2019;s, and asked him to put out a little from the land. And He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat.</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>When He had stopped speaking, He said to Simon, <span>&#x201C;Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>But Simon answered and said to Him, &#x201C;Master, we have toiled all night and caught nothing; nevertheless at Your word I will let down the net.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>And when they had done this, they caught a great number of fish, and their net was breaking. </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>So they signaled to <i>their</i> partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>When Simon Peter saw <i>it,</i> he fell down at Jesus&#x2019; knees, saying, &#x201C;Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish which they had taken; </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>and so also <i>were</i> James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, <span>&#x201C;Do not be afraid. From now on you will catch men.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>So when they had brought their boats to land, they forsook all and followed Him.</span></p>'
            '2 Pet 1:16': '<h3> <span>2 Peter 1:16</span></h3><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>For we did not follow cunningly devised fables when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of His majesty. </span> </p>'

> “But when he saw that the wind was boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried out, saying, ‘Lord, save me!’ And immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and caught him, and said to him, ‘O you of little faith, why did you doubt?’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="Matthew 14:30, 31">Matthew 14:30, 31</a>, NKJV).  

Peter is the author of the two books (1 and 2 Peter) that bear his name. He was one of the early followers of Jesus. He remained with Jesus during the Lord’s ministry here, and he was one of the first disciples to see the empty tomb. As a result, Peter had a wealth of experiences from which, inspired by the Holy Spirit, he could draw in order to write these powerful letters. “For we did not follow cleverly devised tales when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of His majesty” (<a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 1:16">2 Pet. 1:16</a>, NASB).

Peter appears often in the Gospels, revealing both his triumphs and failures. He was the usual spokesperson of the disciples in their interactions with Jesus. After the Resurrection and Ascension, Peter became a prominent early church leader. The book of Acts talks about him, as does the book of Galatians. 

Most important, Peter knew what it was to make mistakes, to be forgiven, and to move forward in faith and humility. Having experienced for himself the grace of God, he remains a powerful voice for all of us who need to experience that same grace, as well.
