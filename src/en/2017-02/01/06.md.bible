            'Acts 10:1–48': '<h3> <span>Acts 10</span></h3><p><span><span>10&#xA0;</span>There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of what was called the Italian Regiment, </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>a devout <i>man</i> and one who feared God with all his household, who gave alms generously to the people, and prayed to God always. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>About the ninth hour of the day he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God coming in and saying to him, &#x201C;Cornelius!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>And when he observed him, he was afraid, and said, &#x201C;What is it, lord?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>So he said to him, &#x201C;Your prayers and your alms have come up for a memorial before God. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>Now send men to Joppa, and send for Simon whose surname is Peter. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>He is lodging with Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea. He will tell you what you must do.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>And when the angel who spoke to him had departed, Cornelius called two of his household servants and a devout soldier from among those who waited on him continually. </span> <span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>So when he had explained all <i>these</i> things to them, he sent them to Joppa.</span></p><p><span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>The next day, as they went on their journey and drew near the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour. </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>Then he became very hungry and wanted to eat; but while they made ready, he fell into a trance </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>and saw heaven opened and an object like a great sheet bound at the four corners, descending to him and let down to the earth. </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>In it were all kinds of four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, creeping things, and birds of the air. </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>And a voice came to him, <span>&#x201C;Rise, Peter; kill and eat.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>But Peter said, &#x201C;Not so, Lord! For I have never eaten anything common or unclean.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>And a voice <i>spoke</i> to him again the second time, <span>&#x201C;What God has cleansed you must not call common.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>This was done three times. And the object was taken up into heaven again.</span></p><p><span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>Now while Peter wondered within himself what this vision which he had seen meant, behold, the men who had been sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon&#x2019;s house, and stood before the gate. </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>And they called and asked whether Simon, whose surname was Peter, was lodging there.</span></p><p><span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>While Peter thought about the vision, the Spirit said to him, &#x201C;Behold, three men are seeking you. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>Arise therefore, go down and go with them, doubting nothing; for I have sent them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>Then Peter went down to the men who had been sent to him from Cornelius, and said, &#x201C;Yes, I am he whom you seek. For what reason have you come?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>And they said, &#x201C;Cornelius <i>the</i> centurion, a just man, one who fears God and has a good reputation among all the nation of the Jews, was divinely instructed by a holy angel to summon you to his house, and to hear words from you.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>Then he invited them in and lodged <i>them.</i></span></p><p><span>On the next day Peter went away with them, and some brethren from Joppa accompanied him.</span></p><p><span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>And the following day they entered Caesarea. Now Cornelius was waiting for them, and had called together his relatives and close friends. </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>As Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshiped <i>him.</i> </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>But Peter lifted him up, saying, &#x201C;Stand up; I myself am also a man.&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>And as he talked with him, he went in and found many who had come together. </span> <span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>Then he said to them, &#x201C;You know how unlawful it is for a Jewish man to keep company with or go to one of another nation. But God has shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean. </span> <span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>Therefore I came without objection as soon as I was sent for. I ask, then, for what reason have you sent for me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>So Cornelius said, &#x201C;Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing, </span> <span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>and said, &#x2018;Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your alms are remembered in the sight of God. </span> <span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>Send therefore to Joppa and call Simon here, whose surname is Peter. He is lodging in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea. When he comes, he will speak to you.&#x2019; </span> <span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>So I sent to you immediately, and you have done well to come. Now therefore, we are all present before God, to hear all the things commanded you by God.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>34&#xA0;</sup>Then Peter opened <i>his</i> mouth and said: &#x201C;In truth I perceive that God shows no partiality. </span> <span><sup>35&#xA0;</sup>But in every nation whoever fears Him and works righteousness is accepted by Him. </span> <span><sup>36&#xA0;</sup>The word which <i>God</i> sent to the children of Israel, preaching peace through Jesus Christ&#x2014;He is Lord of all&#x2014; </span> <span><sup>37&#xA0;</sup>that word you know, which was proclaimed throughout all Judea, and began from Galilee after the baptism which John preached: </span> <span><sup>38&#xA0;</sup>how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him. </span> <span><sup>39&#xA0;</sup>And we are witnesses of all things which He did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem, whom they killed by hanging on a tree. </span> <span><sup>40&#xA0;</sup>Him God raised up on the third day, and showed Him openly, </span> <span><sup>41&#xA0;</sup>not to all the people, but to witnesses chosen before by God, <i>even</i> to us who ate and drank with Him after He arose from the dead. </span> <span><sup>42&#xA0;</sup>And He commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that it is He who was ordained by God <i>to be</i> Judge of the living and the dead. </span> <span><sup>43&#xA0;</sup>To Him all the prophets witness that, through His name, whoever believes in Him will receive remission of sins.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>44&#xA0;</sup>While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who heard the word. </span> <span><sup>45&#xA0;</sup>And those of the circumcision who believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles also. </span> <span><sup>46&#xA0;</sup>For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God.</span></p><p><span>Then Peter answered, </span> <span><sup>47&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Can anyone forbid water, that these should not be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit just as we <i>have?</i>&#x201D; </span> <span><sup>48&#xA0;</sup>And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then they asked him to stay a few days.</span></p>'
            'Acts 1:15–25': '<h3> <span>Acts 1:15-25</span></h3><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples (altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said, </span> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Men <i>and</i> brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus; </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>(Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field is called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.)</span></p><p><span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;For it is written in the Book of Psalms:</span></p><p><span><span>&#x2018;Let his dwelling place be desolate,</span></span><br><span><span>And let no one live in it&#x2019;</span>;</span></p><p><span>and,</span></p><p><span><span>&#x2018;Let</span> <span>another take his office.&#x2019;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Therefore, of these men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, </span> <span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>beginning from the baptism of John to that day when He was taken up from us, one of these must become a witness with us of His resurrection.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>And they proposed two: Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>And they prayed and said, &#x201C;You, O Lord, who know the hearts of all, show which of these two You have chosen </span> <span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>to take part in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.&#x201D; </span> </p>'
            'Acts 4:1–12': '<h3> <span>Acts 4:1-12</span></h3><p><span><span>4&#xA0;</span>Now as they spoke to the people, the priests, the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees came upon them, </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>being greatly disturbed that they taught the people and preached in Jesus the resurrection from the dead. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>And they laid hands on them, and put <i>them</i> in custody until the next day, for it was already evening. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>However, many of those who heard the word believed; and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.</span></p><p><span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>And it came to pass, on the next day, that their rulers, elders, and scribes, </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>as well as Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the family of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem. </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, &#x201C;By what power or by what name have you done this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>8&#xA0;</sup>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, &#x201C;Rulers of the people and elders of Israel: </span> <span><sup>9&#xA0;</sup>If we this day are judged for a good deed <i>done</i> to a helpless man, by what means he has been made well, </span> <span><sup>10&#xA0;</sup>let it be known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, by Him this man stands here before you whole. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>This is the <span>&#x2018;stone which was rejected by you builders, which has become the chief cornerstone.&#x2019;</span> </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.&#x201D;</span></p>'

During the ministry of Jesus, Peter often acted in the role of leader of the 12 disciples. He was their usual spokesman. When Matthew lists the disciples, he says “first, . . . Peter” (<a class="verse" verse="Matt 10:2">Matt. 10:2</a>). Peter also took a prominent role in the early church. It was Peter who took the initiative to appoint a disciple to replace Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus (<a class="verse" verse="Acts 1:15–25">Acts 1:15–25</a>). On the day of Pentecost, it was Peter who explained to the multitudes that they were seeing the promised gift of the Spirit, poured out by God upon His people (<a class="verse" verse="Acts 2:14–36">Acts 2:14–36</a>). It was Peter who, when arrested for speaking about the resurrection of the dead, spoke to the high priest and the assembled Jewish leaders (<a class="verse" verse="Acts 4:1–12">Acts 4:1–12</a>). It was Peter who was led to Cornelius, the first Gentile to be accepted as a follower of Jesus (<a class="verse" verse="Acts 10:1–48">Acts 10:1–48</a>). It was Peter whom Paul visited for 15 days when Paul first came to Jerusalem after his conversion (<a class="verse" verse="Gal 1:18">Gal. 1:18</a>). Indeed, describing the circle of Jesus’ followers in Jerusalem at that time, Paul identifies three “pillars” of the church: Peter, James the brother of Jesus, and John the beloved disciple (<a class="verse" verse="Gal 2:9">Gal. 2:9</a>).

`Read <a class="verse" verse="Gal 1:18; Gal 1:19; Gal 2:9; Gal 2:11; Gal 2:14">Gal 1:18; Gal 1:19; Gal 2:9; Gal 2:11; Gal 2:14</a>; . What do these texts tell us about Peter, even while he functioned so prominently in the early church?` 

Even as a church leader, even as someone clearly called of the Lord (Jesus told Peter, “ ‘Feed my sheep’ ” [<a class="verse" verse="John 21:17">John 21:17</a>]), even as the one who received the vision about not calling “any man common or unclean” (<a class="verse" verse="Acts 10:28">Acts 10:28</a>), Peter still had some important growing to do. 

In the early days of the church, almost all the Christians were Jews, many of whom were “zealous for the law” (<a class="verse" verse="Acts 21:20">Acts 21:20</a>, NKJV). In their interpretation of the law, eating with Gentiles was problematic because the Gentiles were considered unclean. When some Jewish Christians came from James at Jerusalem, Peter stopped eating with the Gentiles in Antioch. 

For Paul, such behavior was an attack on the gospel itself. He saw Peter’s actions as frank hypocrisy, and he wasn’t afraid to challenge him on it. In fact, Paul used the opportunity to express the key teaching of the Christian faith: justification by faith alone (see <a class="verse" verse="Gal 2:14–16">Gal. 2:14–16</a>).

`Though called of God, Peter had some blind spots that needed correcting. How do we respond when others seek to point out our own “blind spots”?`
