So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. </span> <span><sup>11&#xA0;</sup>And Jesus took the loaves, and when He had given thanks He distributed <i>them</i> to the disciples, and the disciples to those sitting down; and likewise of the fish, as much as they wanted. </span> <span><sup>12&#xA0;</sup>So when they were filled, He said to His disciples, <span>&#x201C;Gather up the fragments that remain, so that nothing is lost.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>13&#xA0;</sup>Therefore they gathered <i>them</i> up, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves which were left over by those who had eaten. </span> <span><sup>14&#xA0;</sup>Then those men, when they had seen the sign that Jesus did, said, &#x201C;This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>15&#xA0;</sup>Therefore when Jesus perceived that they were about to come and take Him by force to make Him king, He departed again to the mountain by Himself alone.</span></p><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>Now when evening came, His disciples went down to the sea, </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>got into the boat, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was already dark, and Jesus had not come to them. </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>Then the sea arose because a great wind was blowing. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>So when they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near the boat; and they were afraid. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>But He said to them, <span>&#x201C;It is I; do not be afraid.&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>Then they willingly received Him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.</span></p>'

### Walking on Water 
In their time with Jesus, the disciples saw many remarkable things, although few of them can compare with the events described in <a class="verse" verse="Matthew 14:13–33">Matthew 14:13–33</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Mark 6:30–52">Mark 6:30–52</a>, and <a class="verse" verse="John 6:1–21">John 6:1–21</a>. Jesus used five small loaves of bread and two fish to feed more than 5,000 people. Again, what must have been going on in their minds after seeing something such as this? 

`Read <a class="verse" verse="Matthew 14:22–33">Matthew 14:22–33</a>. What’s the most crucial message we can take away from this story for ourselves to help us in our own walk with the Lord?` 

With the feeding of the multitudes, these men had just witnessed the power of Jesus in a remarkable way. He truly had control over the natural world. That must have been what helped Peter make his rather bold, or even presumptuous, request: “ ‘Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="Matt 14:28">Matt. 14:28</a>, NKJV).

What an expression of faith! 

Jesus, then, acknowledged this faith and told Peter to come, which he did, another expression of Peter’s faith. It would have been one thing to walk on water when it was calm, but Peter did so in the midst of a storm. 

The usual lesson of the story is about taking our eyes off Jesus. But there’s more. Peter surely must have trusted in Jesus, or he never would have made the request and then acted on it. However, once he did act, he started to get scared, and in that fear he began to sink. 

Why? Could not Jesus have kept Peter afloat regardless of Peter’s fear? Jesus, however, allowed Peter to reach the point where he could do nothing but cry out in his helplessness, “ ‘Lord, save me!’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="Matt 14:30">Matt. 14:30</a>, NKJV). Jesus then stretched out His hand and did just what Peter had asked. The fact that “Jesus stretched out His hand and caught him” (<a class="verse" verse="Matt 14:31">Matt. 14:31</a>, NKJV), when Jesus could simply have kept him afloat without the physical contact, surely helped Peter realize just how much he had to learn to depend upon Jesus. 

We can start out in great faith, trusting in the power of our Lord, but when the situation gets frightful, we need to remember Jesus’ words to Peter: “ ‘O you of little faith, why did you doubt?’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="Matt 14:31">Matt. 14:31</a>, NKJV).
