Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>But Jesus said to them, <span>&#x201C;They do not need to go away.

And He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke and gave the loaves to the disciples; and the disciples gave to the multitudes. </span> <span><sup>20&#xA0;</sup>So they all ate and were filled, and they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments that remained. </span> <span><sup>21&#xA0;</sup>Now those who had eaten were about five thousand men, besides women and children.</span></p><p><span><sup>22&#xA0;</sup>Immediately Jesus made His disciples get into the boat and go before Him to the other side, while He sent the multitudes away. </span> <span><sup>23&#xA0;</sup>And when He had sent the multitudes away, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray. Now when evening came, He was alone there. </span> <span><sup>24&#xA0;</sup>But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.</span></p><p><span><sup>25&#xA0;</sup>Now in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea. </span> <span><sup>26&#xA0;</sup>And when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, &#x201C;It is a ghost!&#x201D; And they cried out for fear.</span></p><p><span><sup>27&#xA0;</sup>But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, <span>&#x201C;Be of good cheer! It is I; do not be afraid.&#x201D;</span></span></p><p><span><sup>28&#xA0;</sup>And Peter answered Him and said, &#x201C;Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>29&#xA0;</sup>So He said, <span>&#x201C;Come.&#x201D;</span> And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to go to Jesus. </span> <span><sup>30&#xA0;</sup>But when he saw that the wind <i>was</i> boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried out, saying, &#x201C;Lord, save me!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span><sup>31&#xA0;</sup>And immediately Jesus stretched out <i>His</i> hand and caught him, and said to him, <span>&#x201C;O you of little faith, why did you doubt?&#x201D;</span> </span> <span><sup>32&#xA0;</sup>And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.</span></p><p><span><sup>33&#xA0;</sup>Then those who were in the boat came and worshiped Him, saying, &#x201C;Truly You are the Son of God.&#x201D;</span></p>'

In their time with Jesus, the disciples saw many remarkable things, although few of them can compare with the events described in <a class="verse" verse="Matthew 14:13–33">Matthew 14:13–33</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Mark 6:30–52">Mark 6:30–52</a>, and <a class="verse" verse="John 6:1–21">John 6:1–21</a>. Jesus used five small loaves of bread and two fish to feed more than 5,000 people. Again, what must have been going on in their minds after seeing something such as this?

`Read <a class="verse" verse="Matthew 14:22–33">Matthew 14:22–33</a>. What’s the most crucial message we can take away from this story for ourselves to help us in our own walk with the Lord?` 

With the feeding of the multitudes, these men had just witnessed the power of Jesus in a remarkable way. He truly had control over the natural world. That must have been what helped Peter make his rather bold, or even presumptuous, request: “ ‘Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="Matt 14:28">Matt. 14:28</a>, NKJV).

What an expression of faith! 

Jesus, then, acknowledged this faith and told Peter to come, which he did, another expression of Peter’s faith. It would have been one thing to walk on water when it was calm, but Peter did so in the midst of a storm. 

The usual lesson of the story is about taking our eyes off Jesus. But there’s more. Peter surely must have trusted in Jesus, or he never would have made the request and then acted on it. However, once he did act, he started to get scared, and in that fear he began to sink. 

Why? Could not Jesus have kept Peter afloat regardless of Peter’s fear? Jesus, however, allowed Peter to reach the point where he could do nothing but cry out in his helplessness, “ ‘Lord, save me!’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="Matt 14:30">Matt. 14:30</a>, NKJV). Jesus then stretched out His hand and did just what Peter had asked. The fact that “Jesus stretched out His hand and caught him” (<a class="verse" verse="Matt 14:31">Matt. 14:31</a>, NKJV), when Jesus could simply have kept him afloat without the physical contact, surely helped Peter realize just how much he had to learn to depend upon Jesus. 

We can start out in great faith, trusting in the power of our Lord, but when the situation gets frightful, we need to remember Jesus’ words to Peter: “ ‘O you of little faith, why did you doubt?’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="Matt 14:31">Matt. 14:31</a>, NKJV).
