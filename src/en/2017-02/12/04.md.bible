`In <a class="verse" verse="2 Peter 3:8–10">2 Peter 3:8–10</a>, how does Peter respond to the argument that the scoffers will bring? What does he say that even now can help us to understand why Christ has not yet returned?`

Peter responds to the issue of the unchanging nature of the world. He reminds his listeners that it is not true that the world has continued unchanged since Creation. (Notice how Peter goes right back to the Word of God as his source and authority.) There was a time of great wickedness, after which God destroyed the world with a flood (<a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 3:6">2 Pet. 3:6</a>). And indeed, the Flood brought about a great change to the world, one that remains with us today. Peter then says that the next destruction will be by fire, not water (<a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 3:10">2 Pet. 3:10</a>). 

Peter also wrote, “One day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day” (<a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 3:8">2 Pet. 3:8</a>). In saying this, Peter may have been reflecting on the words of <a class="verse" verse="Psalm 90:4">Psalm 90:4</a>: “For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.” In other words, our conception of time is not like God’s; so, we need to be careful in the judgments we make about time.

From a human perspective, there does seem to be a delay in the return of Christ. But we are looking at things only from our human perspective. From God’s perspective, there is no delay. In fact, Peter is saying that extra time has been granted because God is showing His patience. He does not wish that any should perish (<a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 3:9">2 Pet. 3:9</a>). The extra time, then, has been allowed to provide opportunity for many to repent.

Yet, warns Peter, God’s patience should not be taken as an opportunity to postpone a decision about Jesus. The day of the Lord will come as unexpectedly as a thief in the night. A thief who comes at night probably expects to sneak away unnoticed. But while the day of the Lord will come like a thief, it will certainly be noticed. As Peter says, “the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat” (<a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 3:10">2 Pet. 3:10</a>). Thus, Peter’s message is like Paul’s: “Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation” (<a class="verse" verse="2 Cor 6:2">2 Cor. 6:2</a>).
