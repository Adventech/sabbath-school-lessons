#### **Learning Cycle**
------

#### STEP 1—Motivate

**Spotlight on Scripture**: 2 Peter 1:2–4, 12–15

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: God has provided us with everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of Him and of Jesus our Lord. Peter reminds us that He has given us great and precious promises in which resides the power to overcome our sinful natures and to participate in the divine nature.

**Just for Teachers**: As far as possible, keep in view the five areas of theology that we are focusing on this week. Attempt to integrate them into a wholistic view of the role of Christ in the life and in the experience of a Christian. Peter portrays Jesus as the model Sufferer through His substitutionary sacrifice for our justification. God calls us to holiness (sanctification) in our daily conduct, as a response to coming judgment. We have the hope of glorification at Christ’s return. In view of our preparation for living in God’s eternal kingdom, we need to understand and implement the principles of divine order in society and in the church. The Scriptures are the instruction manual for all of this preparation and implementation, and they must play a central role in the Christian life. They will keep us from being deceived by the many false teachers who want to lead us astray and cause us to fall from our faithful adherence to the truth as it is found in Jesus.

**Opening Activity and Discussion**: Ask the class to read together 2 Peter 1:2–4, 12–15 and 3:1, 2, 17, 18. Discuss what Peter indicates his purposes are for writing his two letters to the believers scattered throughout Asia Minor. How do these purposes relate to the five theological themes that our lesson focuses on this week? What connects these various themes together in an integrated whole in Peter’s letters?

#### STEP 2—Explore

### **Bible Commentary**

**I. The Cost of Our Salvation** (Review together 1 Peter 1:18, 19; 2:22–25; 3:18.)

The language of Redemption is the language of cost or expense. How much did it cost God to redeem fallen humankind? The price could not be paid with silver, gold, or any material substance. The law demanded the life of the sinner. The only way to redeem the sinner was to substitute life for life. This lesson was clearly taught in the Old Testament sanctuary services, and Jesus came to fulfill the type of the sacrificial lamb (John 1:29; Rev. 5:6, 9). The only life that was adequate to pay the price for all of humanity was the life of its Creator. By His precious blood, God redeemed humankind from the curse of the law by making Jesus a curse for us on the cross (Gal. 3:10, 13). There is no other means of salvation.

**Consider This**: What is the cost of salvation? Why was Christ’s the only life adequate enough to pay the price of Redemption for all of humanity?

**II. The Response to Our Salvation** (Review together 1 Peter 1:13–17; 2:1, 2, 11, 12; 3:8, 9; 4:7–11; 2 Peter 3:11, 14.)**

In response to God’s mercy toward us, we desire to share in His holiness—to live godly lives in this world, demonstrating the principles of the kingdom into which we have been born and in which we desire to live eternally. As we face the day of God’s judgment and the destruction of this present creation and of all that pertains to sin, we need to consider what kind of persons we ought to be in all of our conduct, knowing God’s expectations. He calls us to be holy and godly, modeling love and good deeds before unbelievers, so that they will glorify God on the day of judgment, rather than finding cause for accusation.

**Consider This**: In view of the coming cataclysm, what kind of person ought I to be in all holy conduct and godliness?

**III. The Hope of Our Salvation** (Review together 1 Peter 1:3–9, 13; 5:4; 2 Peter 3:3–14.)

Peter holds out before the believer the “living hope” of an inheritance that will never perish, which is the goal of faith, namely, the salvation of our souls (1 Pet. 1:3, 4, 9). He says that this inheritance will take place when Jesus Christ is revealed at the end of time. Although skeptics will arise who will scoff at our hopes in Christ’s coming, Peter assures the believer that any apparent delay is only because we have failed to repent and prepare adequately. Thus, God elects to wait until we become serious enough about our salvation to make the necessary preparation. When the longed-for coming finally occurs, this present earth and sky will be destroyed by a roaring inferno. In view of this impending scenario, we ought to live holy and godly lives as we not only look forward to that day but also help to speed its coming.

**Consider This**: What is the “living hope” to which Peter refers? What are the reasons for what appears like a delay in Christ’s coming, and how may we hasten His return?

**IV. Following the Divine Order** (Review 1 Peter 2:11–21, 5:1–5 with your class.)

As believers prepare for living eternally under God’s system of order, they need to learn to understand and adhere to the divine order in society and in the church. God’s order has established authorities, whether in civil and governmental affairs, in business and employment relationships, in marriage and family relationships, or in church relationships. At all levels, one needs to work within the guidelines of divine order, showing love and respect to all and submission to those in authority. Peter provides specifics for some of these relationships and upholds Jesus as the model for being submissive and for not threatening or retaliating when mistreated.

**Consider This**: How does submitting to God’s system of order in society and in the church help to prepare us for living eternally under His system of order in heaven?

**V. The Role of Scripture** (Review together 1 Peter 1:10–12; 2 Peter 1:19–21; 3:2, 15, 16.)

Peter reminds his readers that Scripture is the final authority for the Christian. The Word of God is not of human initiative; it came about by divine revelation as the Holy Spirit moved on the minds of human agents. It is an objective source of truth that can be trusted. It was recorded and preserved especially for the benefit of those who would live in the time of the fulfillment of the prophecies. Even the writings of New Testament apostles and prophets (such as Paul), who spoke for God and whose writings have been preserved and circulated for the instruction of the churches, have the same authority as that of the Old Testament Scriptures. We will do well to heed them as we would heed a light shining in a dark place until Jesus reigns supreme in our hearts.

Consider This: Why is Scripture the final authority on God’s will for the Christian? Why can we trust it?

**Discussion Questions**:

1. New Testament epistles are characterized primarily by theological instruction and practical admonition. In 1 and 2 Peter, what kind of balance do you find between these two elements?
2. How do Peter’s letters compare theologically with those of Paul?

#### STEP 3—Apply

**Just for Teachers**: As we draw this series of lessons to a close, it would be helpful to encourage the class to summarize some of the key ideas from Peter’s epistles that they have found useful in their own lives. Many of these ideas may be related to one of the five key themes highlighted this week. Some students may find other ideas that stand out for them. What is important is that each person should find something that is meaningful to his or her own life and experience.

**Thought Questions**:

1. What role does Scripture play in my spiritual life? Is it primarily a source for doctrine, or is it primarily a revelation of Jesus Christ, leading me to know and love Him more? Explain your answer.
2. In what ways has my relationship with Jesus Christ made a difference in my relationship with others? What are the ways in which others see Jesus in me?
3. What is my response to the announcement of judgment and the soon return of Christ? Am I fearful, or do I look forward to it as the fulfillment of my hopes and longings? Give reasons for your answer.

**Activity**: Invite the class to read together 2 Timothy 3:12–16. Discuss the similarity between Paul’s final message to Timothy and Peter’s final messages to his readers. What do they both emphasize? What do they clearly think is of vital importance for their readers?

#### STEP 4—Create

**Just for Teachers**: Theological instruction is supposed to lead to changes in behavior, which is why theological instruction in the New Testament letters is generally followed by practical admonition. It is important to see the connections between the two. We need to help our class members to see these connections so that what they learn theologically will be translated into appropriate action.

**Activity**: Create a chart in two columns on a whiteboard or on a large poster board or easel pad. In the left column, identify theological instruction from 1 and 2 Peter. In the right column, identify commensurate action that Peter encourages or might encourage. Discuss both personal and corporate implementation of the actions suggested. (Where supplies are unavailable, adapt the written part of the activity to a discussion-based format by first asking members to identify a theological instruction from 1 and 2 Peter. Then ask them to identify the commensurate action that this instruction might encourage. Conclude by proceeding with the rest of the discussion as outlined.)
