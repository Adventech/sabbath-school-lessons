### How Should We Live?

A theme that Peter returns to more often than any other is posed by the question he asked in <a class="verse" verse="2 Peter 3:11">2 Peter 3:11</a>: “Since all these things are to be dissolved in this way, what sort of persons ought you to be in leading lives of holiness and godliness?” (NRSV).

`Read the following texts. What does Peter say about Christian behavior? <a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 1:15–17, 22">1 Pet. 1:15–17, 22</a>; <a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 2:1">1 Pet. 2:1</a>; <a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 3:8, 9">1 Pet. 3:8, 9</a>; <a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 4:7–11">1 Pet. 4:7–11</a>; <a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 3:11">2 Pet. 3:11</a>.`

Peter considers Christian behavior at many points in his two letters, and a number of themes keep recurring. First, Peter twice emphasizes the link between the judgment of God and Christian behavior (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 1:17">1 Pet. 1:17</a> and <a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 3:11">2 Pet. 3:11</a>). God will judge everyone’s actions. Thus, a Christian should live a life of holiness. 

Second, several times Peter mentions that Christians should be holy. In the Hebrew Bible, things that are holy are set aside for use in the temple (<a class="verse" verse="Exod 26:34; 28:36; 29:6, 37">Exod. 26:34; 28:36; 29:6, 37</a>) or for God’s purposes (for example, the Sabbath in <a class="verse" verse="Genesis 2:3">Genesis 2:3</a>). In fact, God’s plan was that His people should be holy, just as He is holy, a theme Peter touched on, too (<a class="verse" verse="Lev 11:44; 19:2">Lev. 11:44; 19:2</a>; <a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 1:15, 16">1 Pet. 1:15, 16</a>). The process of setting something aside as holy is called “sanctification,” and Peter’s desire is that his readers become sanctified by the Spirit and be obedient to Jesus (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 1:2">1 Pet. 1:2</a>). 

Third, Peter has provided some specifics as to the kind of behavior appropriate to those who are sanctified. They should rid themselves of malice, guile, insincerity, envy, and slander (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 2:1">1 Pet. 2:1</a>). They should have unity in spirit, love for one another, and a humble mind (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 3:8, 9">1 Pet. 3:8, 9</a>). They should have goodness, godliness, and love (<a class="verse" verse="2 Pet 1:5–7">2 Pet. 1:5–7</a>). Indeed, they must maintain constant love (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 4:7–11">1 Pet. 4:7–11</a>). Finally, Peter urges his listeners to cast their anxiety upon Jesus (<a class="verse" verse="1 Pet 5:7">1 Pet. 5:7</a>).

`How can we learn to encourage one another in ways that are not judgmental, to live the kind of life that Peter is calling for in his epistles?`
