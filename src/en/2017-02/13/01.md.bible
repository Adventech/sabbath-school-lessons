            'Lev 16:16–19': '<h3> <span>Leviticus 16:16-19</span></h3><p> <span><sup>16&#xA0;</sup>So he shall make atonement for the Holy <i>Place</i>, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions, for all their sins; and so he shall do for the tabernacle of meeting which remains among them in the midst of their uncleanness. </span> <span><sup>17&#xA0;</sup>There shall be no man in the tabernacle of meeting when he goes in to make atonement in the Holy <i>Place</i>, until he comes out, that he may make atonement for himself, for his household, and for all the assembly of Israel. </span> <span><sup>18&#xA0;</sup>And he shall go out to the altar that <i>is</i> before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, and make atonement for it, and shall take some of the blood of the bull and some of the blood of the goat, and put it on the horns of the altar all around. </span> <span><sup>19&#xA0;</sup>Then he shall sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times, cleanse it, and consecrate it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.</span></p>'
            '1 Cor 14:40': '<h3> <span>1 Corinthians 14:40</span></h3><p> <span><sup>40&#xA0;</sup>Let all things be done decently and in order.</span></p>'

            'Rom 13:1–7': '<h3> <span>Romans 13:1-7</span></h3><p><span><span>13&#xA0;</span>Let every soul be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and the authorities that exist are appointed by God. </span> <span><sup>2&#xA0;</sup>Therefore whoever resists the authority resists the ordinance of God, and those who resist will bring judgment on themselves. </span> <span><sup>3&#xA0;</sup>For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Do you want to be unafraid of the authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from the same. </span> <span><sup>4&#xA0;</sup>For he is God&#x2019;s minister to you for good. But if you do evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is God&#x2019;s minister, an avenger to <i>execute</i> wrath on him who practices evil. </span> <span><sup>5&#xA0;</sup>Therefore <i>you</i> must be subject, not only because of wrath but also for conscience&#x2019; sake. </span> <span><sup>6&#xA0;</sup>For because of this you also pay taxes, for they are God&#x2019;s ministers attending continually to this very thing. </span> <span><sup>7&#xA0;</sup>Render therefore to all their due: taxes to whom taxes <i>are due,</i> customs to whom customs, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor.</span></p>'

### Major Themes in 1 and 2 Peter

### Read for This Week’s Study
<a class="verse" verse="Isa 53:5; Isa 53:6; Isa 53:9">Isa. 53:5; Isa. 53:6; Isa. 53:9</a>; ; <a class="verse" verse="Lev 16:16–19">Lev. 16:16–19</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Lev 11:44">Lev. 11:44</a>; <a class="verse" verse="Rom 13:1–7">Rom. 13:1–7</a>; <a class="verse" verse="1 Cor 14:40">1 Cor. 14:40</a>; <a class="verse" verse="2 Tim 3:16">2 Tim. 3:16</a>.

> <p>Memory Text</p>
> “He himself bore our sins in his body on the cross, so that, free from sins, we might live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed” (<a class="verse" verse="1 Peter 2:24">1 Peter 2:24</a>, NRSV). 

First and 2 Peter were written for practical purposes. In 1 Peter, the big issue Peter confronted was the persecution that Christians were facing. In 2 Peter, the great issue was false teachers. Peter wrote forcefully and authoritatively as he sought to encourage his readers, as well as warn them in regard to the challenges before them.

What is significant is that Peter responds to both issues in theological terms. The sufferings caused by persecution led Peter to meditate on the sufferings and death of Jesus, which had resulted in our salvation. The false teachers are going to face the judgment. This judgment will take place after Jesus returns to this earth with the saved after the thousand years in heaven have ended. These are some of the themes that Peter deals with in his two letters. 

This final week’s lesson will look in more detail at five of the themes Peter wrote about: the suffering of Jesus that led to our salvation; our practical response to the knowledge that God will judge our actions at the last judgment; the hope we have in the soon return of Jesus; order in society and in the church; and the role Scripture has in providing guidance in our lives.
