### Outline #13 Rebirth of Planet Earth

*  Remarkable prophecies of new heavens and a new earth
	* Isaiah 65:17 – first mention in the Scriptures
	* Isaiah 66:22-23
		* What is the significance of the LORD’s promise that the new heavens and a new earth will remain before Him?
		* What encouragement do you find in the promise that our descendants and our name will remain? 1 Corinthians 13:12, John 3:16
		* Why is the Sabbath an important time of worship even in a new earth? Genesis 2:1-3, Revelation 14:6-7, Psalm 95:6-7a, etc.
	* Isaiah 66:24 We might wish this verse was omitted.  It’s not a pleasant scene. Why did the prophet Isaiah include this revelation from the LORD?
	* How long will this scene of destruction exist? Let’s find an answer to that question in some other prophecies about new heavens and a new earth. 2 Peter 3:10-13, Malachi 4:1-3, Revelation 21:1-5
	* Why is a new earth where righteousness dwells such good news for our lives today?
	* What are you most looking forward to in the earth made new?

*  A work to do before the rebirth of planet earth
	* Isaiah 66:18-21 Did you notice God’s remnant in the time of the prophet Isaiah were called to declare His glory among the Gentiles?  How well did they fulfill their mission assignment?
	* How was this prophecy fulfilled by the disciples of Jesus and also by His followers through the ages?  Luke 10:1-2, Acts 1:8, Acts 8:1-5, Acts 17:1-6, Matthew 28:19-20
	* The LORD revealed through the prophet Isaiah that Gentiles would also be chosen to be priests and Levites. Isaiah 66:21 When was that prophecy fulfilled? 1 Peter 2:9-10 (see also Galatians 3:28-29, Colossians 3:1-3, 9-11)
	* What are your thoughts about being part of a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s own special people?
	* What are some ways we can declare the praises of Him who called us out of darkness into His marvelous light?
	* A vast multitude on earth still don’t know the truth about a Creator and Redeemer who loves them with an immeasurable, unfailing love.  What is the best way to share this life-changing truth with them?
