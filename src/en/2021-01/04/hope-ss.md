### Outline #4 The Hard Way

*  Prophecy fulfilled
	* Isaiah 7:16 The LORD revealed through the prophet Isaiah that both the northern kingdom of Israel and Syria would be destroyed.  When was this prophecy fulfilled? 2 Kings 15:29-30, 16:7-9 (734-722 BC)
	* How would you have responded if you were a faithful servant of the LORD living in the northern kingdom of Israel at that time?
	* How should be respond today when we recognize our leaders have disregarded the counsel of God?

*  Consequences of turning away from the LORD
	* 2 Kings 16:10-18 What troubles you as you read this account of the apostasy of King Ahaz, whose father Jotham “did what was right in the sight of the LORD”? (see also 2 Chronicles 28:22-25)
	* Name some other Bible characters whose lives degenerated when they turned away from the LORD.
	* What counsel would you give to a friend who says to you, “I have wandered so far away from God and done things I never would have imagined just a few years ago. Is there any hope for me?”
	* Share your testimony of a time when the LORD rescued you from the path that leads to destruction.

*  The testimony of Isaiah’s second son
	* What is the meaning of the name of Isaiah’s second son? What prophesy is given through his name? Isaiah 8:3-4
	* When we face calamities, why is it important to remember the name of Isaiah’s first son, Shear-Jashub, and also the prophecy of Isaiah 7:14?

*  Choosing to reverence the LORD rather than be fearful
	* Isaiah 8:11-13 The word “fear” has two meanings both in Hebrew and Greek: to be afraid, or to reverence.  What makes the difference?
	* Share some Bible texts that encourage us not be afraid. Isaiah 41:10, Revelation 1:17-18, Luke 12:32, etc.
	* Share Bible texts that encourage us to “fear the LORD”, showing Him reverence and respect. Psalm 34:8-10, Revelation 14:6-7, etc.

*  Choosing to listen to God rather than demons
	* What warning does the LORD give regarding occult practices introduced by King Ahaz? Isaiah 8:19
	* What other passages of Scripture warn us about engaging in occult practices? Deuteronomy 18:9-12, Leviticus 19:31, etc.
	* Why are these warnings so relevant today?
	* Rather than listen to demons, where should we turn for counsel? Isaiah 8:20, Jeremiah 33:3, etc.
