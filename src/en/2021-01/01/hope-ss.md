### Outline #1 Crisis of Identity

*  The setting for Isaiah’s prophetic ministry
	* Isaiah 1:1-2a What important information can we learn about Isaiah from the opening verse of his book?
		* He was a real person, rather than a fictional character (son of Amoz).
		* He had the prophetic gift. (see also Isaiah 6:1, Isaiah 46:9-10, Amos 3:7, Acts 21:8-11)
		* His ministry spanned the reign of four kings. (circa 740-698 BC)
	* Who were the intended recipients of his messages from the LORD? Isaiah 1:3, 2:1
	* Why was Isaiah given the prophetic gift at this time? Isaiah 1:2-9

*  Like Sodom and Gomorrah
	* Isaiah 1:10-15 Why did the LORD compare the people of Judah to the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah? (see Genesis 13:13, 18:20)
	* Isaiah 1: 16-17 What appeal does the LORD make through the prophet Isaiah to the people of Judah? (see also Micah 6:8)
	* How is such a transformation of behavior possible?
	* What vital lesson can we learn from God’s judgment on Sodom and Gomorrah? Genesis 19:12-16

*  God’s merciful offer of forgiveness and cleansing
	* Isaiah 1:18 What are your thoughts about this invitation from the LORD?
	* Share other Bible promises of forgiveness and cleansing?  Psalm 51:1-2, 1 John 1:9, etc.
	* How does the love song recorded in Isaiah 5:1-7 reveal the loving and merciful character of God?
	* Share a time when you accepted God’s merciful offer of forgiveness and cleansing.
	* How would you respond to a friend who says, “I’ve committed too many sins—it’s too late for me!”?

*  Choices determine destiny
	* Isaiah 1:19-20 What admonition and warning does the LORD convey through the prophet Isaiah? (see also Deuteronomy 30:15-19)
	* We know we are saved by God’s grace, not by our own works. (Ephesians 2:8-9) How then do our choices determine our destiny?
	* Why are there only two choices, and not a multitude of options? (see Matthew 7:13-14, John 14:6)
	* Share a Bible story that illustrates choices determining destiny.
	* Share a time when you experienced the blessings of God as you determined to follow Him.
