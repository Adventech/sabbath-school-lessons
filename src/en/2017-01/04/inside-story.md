#### Finding God’s Plan: Part 2

Roza continued attending the Seventh-day Adventist church, and she became convinced that this was where God wanted her to be. After attending the church for several months, Roza asked to be baptized.

Her parents were angry when she told them about her decision. For the first time in her life, her father hit her. And her mother demanded that she leave the house.

Roza packed a few clothes and her school textbooks and left her parents’ home. She went to stay with an Adventist family who lived nearby. Two weeks later Roza’s mother sent her sister to ask her to return home.

She was permitted to sleep in her own bed, but her parents no longer supported her financially. A scholarship paid her school tuition, but Roza took a job cleaning the church to pay for food and other necessities. She spent most of her time in class and studying in the school library, going home only to sleep. Roza managed to finish college on her own. 

Roza knew that her mother was worried about her. “How will you ever find a husband?” she asked. Roza knew her mother had a point, because there weren’t many Adventists in Poland. But she claimed God’s promises to provide for her in every way.

While Roza was preparing for baptism, she met Krystov [Chris-toff], a young man who lived in another city and also was planning to be baptized. The two began writing to each other, and in time they began dating. Eventually, they were married.

Krystov entered the ministry, and Roza began her career as a teacher. Her family saw that the couple was happy in their faith and in their work, and they have reconciled with their daughter. Roza hopes that one day soon her parents will find the joy in Jesus that she and Krystov know.

Roza is grateful to God for leading her to the Savior through the influence of her grandmother, a Bible lecture brochure, and a Bible camp filled with friendly youth who welcomed her.
