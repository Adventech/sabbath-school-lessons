“All through the week, we should be thinking about the Sabbath. We should get ready during the week for the Sabbath. Then we can keep it the way God commands us. We must not make the Sabbath only about rules that show the things we can do and cannot do.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church, volume 6, page 353, adapted.

“Everyone in heaven keeps the Sabbath. But they do not keep the Sabbath in a lifeless way. God and His angels do not sit around doing nothing on this day. On the Sabbath, we should be spiritually awake. Why? Because we are going to meet with God and Jesus our Savior on this day! By faith, we may see Jesus. Jesus deeply wishes to refresh and bless every one of us.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church, volume 6, page 353, adapted.

“We need help from God on the Sabbath even more than on other days. On the Sabbath, we stop our work for the week. We spend the Sabbath thinking about God and worshiping Him. We ask more favors from God on the Sabbath than on other days. We ask for His special attention. We so deeply want His best and biggest blessings. God does not wait for the Sabbath to end before He answers our prayers. The work of God never stops. In the same way, we must never rest from doing good. The Sabbath is not meant to be a time when we do nothing and are useless. The law forbids us to do any work on the Sabbath that is not holy. So, the work we do to earn a living must stop. We must not please ourselves or make money on the Sabbath. We must do what God did after He made the sky and the earth. He rested on the seventh day. So, we must too. We should rest, worship, and do holy work. Jesus healed the sick on the Sabbath. This work keeps the law of God and honors the Sabbath.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, page 207, adapted.

**Discussion Questions**:

`Today, people from many different countries talk about the need for humans to take care of our planet. How can we, as Adventists, be good managers of nature, animals, and the planet?`

`Where does our helping other people start? In our minds and hearts. How can we help other people around us in our churches, towns, and families learn to be more caring? In what ways does the Sabbath offer us the wonderful chance to show people how to care about the needy, the poor, the homeless, and the hungry?`

`Every Sabbath, we remember that God made all people. The Sabbath helps us see people as God sees them: with the eyes of love. How should the Sabbath help us remember that the different things that separate people groups do not matter in the eyes of God? How should this understanding help us love people even more?`
