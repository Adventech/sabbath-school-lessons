`What are areas in your life where you can change?`

`What are areas in your life where you absolutely need the power of God to change?`

`How does one know the difference between these two areas?`

`How are obedience and sanctification linked? Why?`

`What are aspects of your spiritual development that have occurred instantaneously?`

`What are aspects of your spiritual development that have taken longer than you thought? Why do you think so?`

`What is the connection between the Sabbath and spiritual change in your life?`

`How do you explain sanctification to someone who has never experienced it before?`

`What does the Holy Spirit working in you to will and to do of His good pleasure feel like?`
