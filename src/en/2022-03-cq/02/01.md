**Read This Week’s Passage: Exodus 20:8–11**

**Who Do We Celebrate?**

Birthday parties typically honor the person born on that day. Yet, on the day of their birth, it was their mother who had to endure labor to bring them into the world. An argument could be made for the birthday celebration to honor the mother who birthed on that day.

At the end of the creation week, God instituted the Sabbath. It serves as a memorial of His creation. As the fourth commandment states, on the Sabbath we remember that God completed His work of creation in six days (Exod. 20:11). Just as with birthday celebrations, we may find ourselves so focused on God’s work that we miss the God who did the work.

Because God is infinitely greater than we are, there are many things we cannot fully comprehend about His nature. Yet, as far greater as He is than us, God condescends to be known by us. And it is through His works that we come to know Him.

This week we turn our focus to the Creator God. In speaking of who He is, we cannot but speak of what He does, but we will try to peer deeper than the surface. Going beyond His actions, what can the Sabbath teach us about God Himself? How can the Sabbath serve as a reminder of His character?
