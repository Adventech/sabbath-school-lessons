  title: "Reflections on the Sabbath"
  description: "As His final creative act during creation week, God created holy time. Without the record of God declaring the seventh day holy, nothing would differentiate the time on the first day from that on the seventh. Accepting the creation narrative as the authoritative account of origins requires faith (Heb. 11:3). In the same manner, embracing the holiness of the Sabbath is a faith venture. Faithfully observing the Sabbath facilitates an allegiance to the God who created the world in six literal days by His Word."
