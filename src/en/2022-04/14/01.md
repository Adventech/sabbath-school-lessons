### Read for This Week’s Study

Scripture gives us this hope: “But according to His promise we are looking for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells” (2 Pet. 3:13, NASB).

For some, however, the promise of “a new heaven and a new earth” (Rev. 21:1) seems like a fantasy, stories told by those in power who used the hope of an afterlife to help keep the masses in line. The idea being: _Though you have it hard at present, one day you will have your reward in heaven_, or the like.

And though some people have used the future hope presented in the Bible that way, their abuse doesn’t change the truth of the promises that we have regarding the new heavens and the new earth.

In the last days, scoffers will ridicule our blessed hope (2 Pet. 3:3–7). But their scoffing, just as predicted, could be seen as more evidence that what the Bible says is true, for they are scoffing as the Bible predicted they would.

During this week we will reflect on the glorious promise of a new heaven and a new earth, including the heavenly temple, the presence of God, the end of death and tears—and, finally, the ultimate triumph of God’s love.
