Key Texts: Isaiah 35:4; Daniel 7:9, 10, 13, 14, 22, 26, 27; Revelation 20:7–15

#### Part I: Overview

God is our Judge (Isa. 35:4). As our Judge, He is impartial in His judgment. This is good news for us. As fallen beings with imperfect judgment and a tendency toward partiality and prejudice, we tend to transport some folks into heaven and then refuse others entry. God knows human hearts, thinking, and motives; thereby, He alone can deliver to every human being an unbiased and just sentence.

Through His judgments, God restores His glory and vindicates His character. He does so openly and consistently so that everyone can know who He is (Ps. 34:8). God wants all intelligent beings in the universe to understand His purposes and to know that He deals with evil fairly, punishes the wicked appropriately, and saves sinners justly (Ezek. 18:21, 23, 32; Ezek. 33:11; Rom. 3:21–26).

The gospel according to God’s judgment focuses on the salvation of repentant sinners and thus presents good news about the God of love, who, out of His love, judges and brings a lasting solution to the problems of death, suffering, pain, injustice, and violence, which are all results of sin (Rom. 6:23; 2 Thess. 1:9; Rev. 21:3, 4).

In the end, God will fully restore harmony and peace throughout the entire universe (Eph. 1:10). Evil and anything or anyone who associates with it will be eliminated and destroyed (Matt. 25:41, 46; Rev. 20:13–15). Everyone who totally and voluntarily submitted to God, acknowledging Him as his or her Creator, Redeemer, Lord, and King will receive everlasting life, joyfully serving and worshiping Him forever (Exod. 34:6, 7; Dan. 7:14, 27; Nah. 1:7; John 3:16, 17; Eph. 1:4–10; Phil. 2:10, 11; Rev. 15:3, 4). Thus, the original abundant life of joy, happiness, and peace will be restored and never again be disrupted by any form of disobedience or rebellion (Nah. 1:9; John 10:10; Rom. 2:7; 1 Tim. 1:16; 2 Tim. 4:7, 8; Titus 2:11–14).

#### Part II: Commentary

**Central and Cosmic Judgment on the Cross**

In creating a solution to the problem of sin, God is a Master Designer. Christ’s death on the cross is at the solution’s very center. Different attestations and judgments are revealed in the Cross event: (1) God was vindicated—Golgotha proves that God is the God of love, truth, justice, holiness, order, and freedom, and He is the Warrantor of peace, joy, and prosperity (Ps. 51:4, John 3:16, Rom. 3:21–26); (2) Satan was judged and sentenced (John 16:11, Heb. 2:14); (3) sin was judged and condemned (Rom. 8:3); (4) humanity was judged, and its condemnation was taken by Christ upon Himself (Isa. 53:4–6, 2 Cor. 5:21, Gal. 3:13), and provision to live eternally was made for those who accept Jesus Christ as their personal Savior (1 John 5:12, 13). God wants every person to live (Ezek. 18:30–32; 1 Tim. 2:2, 3).

**Pre-Advent or Investigative Judgment**

The Bible testifies that when God calls the heavenly court into session prior to His second coming (Dan. 7:9, 10, 13, 14, 22, 26, 27; Rev. 11:19; Rev. 14:7; compare with Matt. 22:1–14), the primary purpose will be to legally and eternally secure our place within the heavenly family. John 14:2, 3 reassures us that Jesus is not building our places in heaven as a Master Builder, shaping a nice house or mansion for us (He could do that in a matter of seconds), but He is legally securing our place in heaven before the representatives of the whole universe. This legal proceeding takes a lot of time, as attested in Daniel 7:9, 10, 13, 14, 22, 26, 27. Jesus, as the true Witness, will fairly present our individual cases and proclaim in front of the whole universe that we, as believers in Him, are His; we have accepted His death to purify us from sin; His grace is sufficient for us, and the power of His grace works in us.

Jesus secures our salvation legally, openly, publicly, and transparently before all inhabitants of the universe, so that no one during eternity will ever raise the question of something being done secretly or partially. Jesus makes it plain that the saved are trustworthy people and will fit into the heavenly family because God’s amazing grace is a transforming grace that changes them. God wants us to be accepted into heaven without any doubts or question marks.

Therefore, given the nature of this investigative judgment, it also can be called the affirmative judgment that certifies, seals, and ratifies what was done during a person’s lifetime. Affirmative judgment is a confirmation of lifetime decisions.

Different terms can be used to explain various aspects of the pre-Advent judgment: (1) affirmative judgment—especially from the perspective of the redeemed because Jesus takes our cases and affirms in front of the universe our relationship with Him; (2) revelatory judgment—Jesus reveals to the entire heavenly family who God’s true followers are and unmasks the antichrist, who plays at being God and His agent of salvation; (3) demonstrative judgment—God presents facts to heavenly beings and shows them our attitudes toward Him, His law, people, nature, and sin, and He explains how He deals with sin, evil, the devil, and all who followed Satan; (4) investigative judgment—angels and heavenly beings need this judgment in order to have additional insights into the great controversy about why God saves some and others He does not accept into heaven. Thus, the books are opened for the sake of heaven’s celestial citizens (Dan. 7:10), demonstrating the objectivity of God’s decisions.

The pre-Advent judgment does not pronounce a new sentence in contrast to what we experience in our daily life. Jesus will affirm God’s saving activity or the condemnation of a particular person. We do not need to be afraid of God’s pre-Advent judgment; because at that judgment, He confirms, reveals, discloses, and demonstrates to the heavenly world the decisions we made for Him during our lifetime. He will not add anything else to our decisions, and neither will He alter them. As the One who is faithful and true, He testifies for His people that we are His (Rom. 8:31, Rev. 3:14).

**The Last or Annihilation Judgment**

The final judgment on earth occurs at the end of the millennium, when the wicked will be resurrected. They gather to attack God and His people in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 20:7–10, Rev. 21:1–3). God Himself is seated on the great white throne, and He judges all unrepentant creatures (Rev. 20:11, 12). In the light of the Cross, the history of sin and salvation will be displayed. Each stage of the rebellion against God, as well as His wonderful plan of redemption—from the beginning of the rebellion of Satan in heaven to the supreme sacrifice of Jesus on the cross to the final victory at the Second Coming—will be shown. Also, all the wicked will see their lives in the light of the Cross.

The cross of Jesus will be elevated above the throne of God, as Ellen G. White states: “Above the throne is revealed the cross; and like a panoramic view appear the scenes of Adam’s temptation and fall, and the successive steps in the great plan of redemption.”—The Great Controversy, p. 666. The wicked will see what God was doing for their salvation, how many chances they rejected, how they despised His grace in their pride and ignorance. Their stubbornness and indifference will be keenly unmasked, and they will see the true nature of their rebellion.

Satan will lead all sinners into a final, desperate attack against the Holy City. Their wicked character is thus proven and demonstrated once again. Even the best information about God, His character and actions, will not change these beings. They are wicked through and through. There is only one solution: annihilation of evil in all its forms. Fire from heaven will fall and will definitively do away with sin, evil, and rebellion _(Rev. 20:9, 10)_. This cleansing fire will constitute the annihilative judgment, the final, eternal, nonreversible death. For those who rejected Jesus as their Savior and stayed in their stubborn attitudes, there is no hope. Their nature was to destroy. God needs, therefore, out of love, to destroy those destroyers. The nature of this judgment is the final execution. God must respond to the destructive behavior of unrepentant humans, evil angels, and the devil. If He did not respond, evil would triumph, and life would be jeopardized and ultimately annihilated. Sin, sinners, and the devil with his angels are wiped out, and the earth is purged of evil (Rev. 20:9, 13–15; compare with 2 Pet. 3:7, 10–13).

After cutting off what was sick and sinful without possible healing, God acts as Re-Creator of life. He will create the new heavens and the new earth (Revelation 21; Revelation 22). Salvation and life will be secured for all eternity. Sin will never occur again. All intelligent beings in the universe will serve God faithfully out of love and gratitude because they know the goodness, love, justice, and truth of God. Love, peace, harmony, joy, justice, freedom, order, and truth will reign for all eternity. God as the Lord of lords and King of kings will be loved, admired, followed, obeyed, and worshiped forever and ever by everyone (Dan. 7:27; Revelation 21; Revelation 22).

Thus, the theology of God’s judgment is the ultimate revelation and demonstration of the love, truth, and justice of God (Phil. 2:10, 11; Rev. 15:2–4). God’s government is open; God’s ways are demonstrated and proven to be right and just. God is just while justifying sinners who accepted Him; trusted Him as their personal Savior; and said no to sin, wickedness, Satan, and fallen angels.

#### Part III: Life Application

1.	Why is God’s judgment so needed and crucial in the context of the great controversy and the interest of the universe in the question of sin?

2.	How do we differentiate between the positive divine judgments and the negative judgments?

3.	How do we live in anticipation of God’s judgment without being frightened by it?
