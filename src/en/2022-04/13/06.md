God is leading human history toward its end-time climax. At the end of the millennium all the wicked dead are raised from their graves to receive their final punitive sentences (Rev. 20:5, 11–15). Then, when the whole judging process is completed and nothing else can be added to it, the wicked will acknowledge God’s justice. “With all the facts of the great controversy in view, the whole universe, both loyal and rebellious, with one accord declare: ‘Just and true are Thy ways, Thou King of saints.’ ” And Satan himself “bows down and confesses the justice of his sentence.”—Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy, pp. 670, 671.

`Read Malachi 4:1; Revelation 20:14, 15; and Revelation 21:8. How effective are the “lake of fire” and the “second death”?`

The final destruction of Satan and his angels and all the wicked will cleanse the universe from sin and its consequences. And yet, even the final destruction of the wicked is an act of God’s love, not only for the saints but also for the wicked themselves. They would rather die than live in the presence of God who is a “consuming fire” for sin (Heb. 12:29).

“They [the lost] would long to flee from that holy place. They would welcome destruction, that they might be hidden from the face of Him who died to redeem them. The destiny of the wicked is fixed by their own choice. Their exclusion from heaven is voluntary with themselves, and just and merciful on the part of God.”—Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy, p. 543.

Thus, the final annihilation of sin and sinners—in contrast to the unbiblical theory of their everlasting sufferings in hell—provides a just and proportional punishment for whatever evil people had committed. It also confirms that sin had a beginning and will have an end. Then the whole universe will return to its original perfection, before sin, evil, and disobedience arose mysteriously and without any justification.

Praise the Lord that He, as our “righteous Judge” (2 Tim. 4:8, NKJV), will make the fair decision of granting immortality to the righteous and eternal destruction to the wicked.

`What would be wrong with the idea that God saves everyone in the end? Why is that such a bad idea?`
