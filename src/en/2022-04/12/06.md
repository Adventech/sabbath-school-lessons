We live in a frenetic world with too many artificial needs and eye-catching distractions. If we are not careful, these can take all our time and pervert our priorities. This is not just another by-product of our globalized cyber world; Christians in every age, to one degree or another, have to be on guard against Satan’s attempts to distract them from what really matters in this life.

Who, if not careful, is not in danger of looking away from the Lord and dwelling on worldly, carnal things, things that, in the end, cannot ultimately satisfy us, and that, in the end, can lead to our spiritual ruin?

`Read 2 Peter 3:14 and 1 John 3:1–3. What difference do you see between preparing ourselves for the Second Coming and being ready for that glorious event?`

Often the notion of an _ongoing preparation_ for the Second Coming becomes an excuse for procrastination. This notion can easily lead one to relax under the evil servant’s assumption, “ ‘ “My master is delaying his coming” ’ ” (Matt. 24:48, NKJV).

`Read Psalm 95:7, 8; Hebrews 3:7, 8, 15; and Hebrews 4:7. What are these verses saying to us about being ready right now?`

From the biblical perspective, the time of salvation is always “today” and never tomorrow (see Ps. 95:7, 8; Heb. 3:7, 8, 15; Heb. 4:7). And further: unless a major conversion experience takes place, we will continue to be what we are right now. Time itself does not convert the unconverted. If anything, unless one is continually growing in grace, and pressing on ahead in faith, the tendency would be to fall away, to become hardened, skeptical, cynical, even disbelieving.

From this perspective we can say that every single day of our life is our life in miniature. So, by God’s grace, we should plan for the future but should live each day ready for the return of Jesus—especially because, given the contingencies of this life, today could be our last day.

`How can you, today, be ready for the return of Jesus were He to return today? Discuss your answer in class on Sabbath.`
