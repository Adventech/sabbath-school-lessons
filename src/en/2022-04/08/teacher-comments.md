Key Text: 1 Corinthians 15:20

#### Part I: Overview

The New Testament passages about the resurrection from the dead, whether from Paul and the other apostles or from Jesus Himself, once again do not say anything about immortal souls or spirits already being in heaven. The New Testament hope is found in the resurrection and the Second Coming.

The passages mentioned in this lesson in conjunction with the state of the dead are as follows:

•	_Hebrews 11:39, 40_: Heroes of faith do not receive their heavenly reward until we receive ours.

•	_1 John 5:11, 12_: This text teaches that only those who are in Christ have eternal life. Therefore, the implications are clear: we are not endowed with immortal “souls,” because only those who choose Christ will receive eternal life.

•	_1 Corinthians 15:12–19_: Our hope of eternal life and resurrection comes from the resurrection of Jesus. If we don’t rise at that time, it means that Christ did not rise. If that is true, then we all die and stay dead forever.

•	_John 14:1–3_: Jesus promised to prepare a place for us and come back to get us. This promise would be unnecessary if we already were in heaven.

•	_John 6:35–54_: Jesus says four times that He will raise him (humans) up in the last day. If humans will be raised up, then they need to come back to life after death, which precludes living somewhere else as souls/spirits.

•	_1 Thessalonians 4:13–18_: God will resurrect the deceased believers, and they will be met by those who are alive at that time. The final resurrection wouldn’t matter if souls already were in heaven.

•	_1 Corinthians 15:51–55_: The “mystery” is the transformation of the righteous living at the Second Coming. The resurrection of the dead and transformation of the living righteous happen at the same time.

#### Part II: Commentary

Let’s take a closer look at 1 Corinthians 15, as two of the passages studied in this lesson are from this chapter. Chapter 15 is packed with information about the resurrection of Jesus, our resurrection, and how we will all be changed and given immortal bodies at the Second Coming (1 Cor. 15:35–44). Even so, we will be able to have immortality only because of the sustaining power of God. “The absence of death does not mean that human life will be independent of God, who alone possesses unborrowed, inherent immortality (1 Tim. 6:16). Glorified humans will continue to depend on the Creator for their life-support.”—Roy E. Gane, “At-one-ment Forever in God’s New Heaven and New Earth,” Salvation: Contours of Adventist Soteriology, edited by Martin F. Hanna, Darius W. Jankiewicz, and John W. Reeve (Berrien Springs, MI: Andrews University Press, 2018), p. 254.

The river of life and the tree of life, mentioned in Revelation 22, demonstrate that humans will always be dependent on _the_ Source of life: God. He also will be their light (Rev. 22:5), although that doesn’t mean that the sun and moon will not be there. The fact that humans will be eating fruit from the tree and drinking water from the river demonstrates that humans will be resurrected with corporeal forms and not simply be disembodied spirits. Humans will be resurrected “to live forever in bodily form, not with the present natural/unspiritual (Greek psuchikos) body (soma) that decays and dies, but with the body (_soma_) that is immortal because it is spiritual (pneumatikos; 1 Cor. 15:44; cf. the context in vv. 42–43, 45–54). The body is changed (v. 52), but the person does not become a disembodied spirit.”— Salvation: Contours of Adventist Soteriology, p. 254.

**1 Corinthians 15**

In 1 Corinthians 15, Paul addresses the false belief that there is no future resurrection of the body. This error derives from the Hellenistic Gnostic belief in an immortal soul that some, or many, Corinthian believers must have embraced. Paul makes the argument that a denial of bodily resurrection for the believers is a denial of Jesus’ bodily resurrection. If people will not be resurrected bodily, then clearly Jesus also was not resurrected (1 Cor. 15:12–19). And if that is the case, then we should be pitied more than anyone else because we believe a lie, and, consequently, none of us will be forgiven for our sins. Those of us who are alive and those of us who have died, therefore, have no hope of eternal life.

Instead, Jesus is said to be the “firstfruits” of those who had fallen asleep (died). “For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive. But each in turn: Christ, the firstfruits; then, when he comes, those who belong to him” (1 Cor. 15:22, 23, NIV). The metaphor comes from the first harvest. Just as first came the firstfruits/produce that signaled that the entire harvest was soon to follow, so Christ was first, and then the harvest will come. The harvest will be all those who “belong to him.”

The Greek word for “firstfruits” is _aparche_ and means, first and foremost, “firstfruits,” second, a “proportionate gift” from earnings (a thank offering), or third, it could mean “an offering.” The Israelites would pre­sent the “firstfruits,” the first sheaf of the harvest in the temple, and a priest would wave it before the Lord. All these actions happened on Nisan 16 and were a reminder of a pledge of a full harvest.

Fascinatingly, Jesus was resurrected on Nisan 16. Therefore, He served as the pledge, the first sheaf, the firstfruits, of the full harvest of all the believers who will be resurrected one day, as well. But it’s important to notice that the harvest appears only “when he comes” again. So, there is no harvest that already is physically in heaven, except for those whom we are told were resurrected or taken straight to heaven, such as Enoch, Elijah, Moses, and those who were raised from the dead during Christ’s resurrection (Matt. 27:52). Jesus’ “newness of life” _(Rom. 6:4)_ points to the new life and resurrection of all the believers.

Although Paul said “all will be made alive,” he by no means suggests that everyone will be given eternal life. Paul did not believe in universal salvation (Rom. 2:5–12, Eph. 5:6, 2 Thess. 1:6–10) and makes it clear that those who will be resurrected at the Second Coming are those who are “in Christ.” Paul uses the phrase “in Christ” in his letters to signify a close relationship and unity between the believer and Jesus. Paul emphasizes that Christ’s resurrection accomplished more than His own return to life. Christ’s resurrection has provided eternal life for all who have exercised faith in Him.

“Then the end will come” (1 Cor. 15:24, NIV). The end is characterized by a destruction of “all dominion, authority and power,” which is referring to the principalities and powers of Satan. Paul uses the terms _authority_ and _power_ to denote human authority and demonic powers (Rom. 13:1–3, Eph. 1:21, Eph. 6:12). At the Second Coming, divine judgment is carried out upon Satan, including all who belong to him and chose to follow the path of evil and destruction. Paul adds, “The last enemy to be destroyed is death” (1 Cor. 15:26, ESV). This eradication will not occur until after the millennium (Rev. 20:1–10), at which time the wicked will be brought back to life and shown that God is just in destroying evil. Then they will perish in the final fire. This fire is eternal because its results last forever. From this death there is no return.

After Paul explains that it is, in fact, the body that will be resurrected at the resurrection and uses the metaphor of a seed being sown, which will grow into a living plant, even if it is buried in the ground, he goes on to state that the resurrected body will be a new body (1 Cor. 15:35–41). The seed doesn’t represent, or look like, the plant that it grows into, and yet a seed is transformed into a plant. In the same way, we will be given new bodies.

At this point, Paul highlights four differences that can be anticipated with the resurrection of the righteous dead. First, the body on earth is perishabl­e—subject to disease and death—but it will be made imperishable. Second, from dishonor we will go to a glorified body—dishonor because we are sinful, but the resurrected body will bear no limitations of sin; it will be perfect. Third, our bodies are weak, because sin affects everything, including our ability to resist sin; but our bodies will be raised in power instead. Last, a natural body will be changed into a spiritual body.

In the verses that follow, Paul explains the difference between a natural body and a spiritual body. First, we must not assume that Paul means to say that only the natural body is a real body—and not the spiritual body, as well—simply because the spiritual body will be free from the curse of sin. We inherit the natural body from the post-Fall Adam (with limitations such as sickness, hunger, pain, fatigue, and death), whereas the spiritual body comes through Jesus. “ ‘The first man Adam became a living being’; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit” (1 Cor. 15:45, ESV). Adam was given life, but Christ gives life. Christ didn’t just passively receive life but grants eternal life to everyone who believes in Him. The body that will be given to the believers is a spiri­tual, heavenly body, meaning that it is endowed with Christ’s spiritual nature rather than with sinful human nature.

After this explanation, Paul leads the readers through an exegesis of the “mystery,” which is the teaching that “we will all be changed” (1 Cor. 15:51, NIV). At the Second Coming, those who will be taken into the clouds with Jesus will be comprised of two groups from the earth: those who have died and those who are still alive. The “change” will mean a bodily resurrection for the dead in Christ and a bodily transformation of the righteous living. Both groups will change from mortal to immortal “in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet” (1 Cor. 15:52, NIV).

Death will lose its sting and its victory (1 Cor. 15:55). Sin causes death. It is a deadly poison. But because of Christ’s death on the cross and His resurrection, He has won the victory over sin and death. We have the sure promise of an eternal life, transformed heavenly bodies, and an end to sin and death, all because Christ was raised from the dead.

#### Part III: Life Application
