`Read 1 Corinthians 1:18–24. What is Paul saying about the Cross, and how does he contrast it with the “wisdom of the world”? Why, even today, when “materialism” (the idea that all reality is only material, which means there is no God or supernatural realm of existence) dominates “the wisdom of the world,” is the message of the Cross so important?`

The Cross of Christ is the very center of salvation history. “Eternity can never fathom the depth of love revealed in the cross of Calvary. It was there that the infinite love of Christ and the unbounded selfishness of Satan stood face to face.”—Stephen N. Haskell, The Cross and Its Shadow (South Lancaster, MA: Bible Training School, 1914), p. v.

While Christ was humbly offering Himself as a ransom for the human race, Satan was selfishly engulfing Him in suffering and agony. Christ did not die just the natural death that every human being has to face. He died the second death, so that all those who accept Him will never have to experience it for themselves.

In regard to the meaning of the Cross, there are several important aspects that we should remember. First, the Cross is the supreme revelation of God’s justice against sin (Rom. 3:21–26). Second, the Cross is the supreme revelation of God’s love for sinners (Rom. 5:8). Third, the Cross is the great source of power to break the chains of sin (Rom. 6:22, 23; 1 Cor. 1:17–24). Fourth, the Cross is our only hope of eternal life (Phil. 3:9–11; John 3:14–16; 1 John 5:11, 12). And fifth, the Cross is the only antidote against a future rebellion in the universe (Rev. 7:13–17, Rev. 22:3).

None of these crucial truths about the Cross can be discovered by the “wisdom of the world.” On the contrary, then, as now, the preaching of the Cross is “foolishness” to worldly wisdom, which often doesn’t even acknowledge the most obvious truth there could be: that a Creator exists (see Rom. 1:18–20).

The Greek word for “foolishness” is linked to the English word “moron”; that is, the preaching of the Cross is “moronic” according to the “wisdom of the world.” Worldly wisdom cannot know Jesus or the salvation that He offers us through His substitutionary death on the cross.

`Whatever value some “worldly wisdom” can offer, why must we never let it interfere with what we believe about Jesus and the hope we’re offered through “the foolishness of the message preached” (1 Cor. 1:21, NKJV)?`
