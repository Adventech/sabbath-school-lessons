### Read for This Week’s Study

> “Jesus said to her, ‘I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me, even if he dies, will live, and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die forever. Do you believe this?’ ” (John 11:25, 26, LEB).

The Old Testament references to the resurrection that we have looked at so far were largely based on personal expectations (Job 19:25–27, Heb. 11:17–19, Ps. 49:15, Ps. 71:20) and on future promises (Dan. 12:1, 2, 13). However, we also have the inspired records of cases in which people actually were raised from the dead.

The first resurrection was of Moses (Jude 9, Luke 9:28–36). During Israel’s monarchy, the son of the widow of Zarephath (1 Kings 17:8–24) and the Shunammite’s son (2 Kings 4:18–37) also were resurrected. Christ, when here in the flesh, resurrected the son of the widow of Nain (Luke 7:11–17), Jairus’s daughter (Luke 8:40–56), and then Lazarus (John 11). Except for Moses, all these people were raised as mortals who eventually would die again. These cases also confirm the biblical teaching of the unconsciousness of the dead (Job 3:11–13; Ps. 115:17; Ps. 146:4; Eccles. 9:5, 10). In none of these accounts, nor in any other biblical resurrection narratives, is there any mention of a supposed afterlife experience.

This week we will reflect more closely on the resurrections that occurred before Christ’s own death and resurrection.
