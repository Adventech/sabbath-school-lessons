#### A Daring Witness

_By Rick McEdward_

At the beginning of the semester, a university classmate asked Sandra if he could take a picture of her class notes with his cell phone. “I saw that you are writing in English,” he said. “I want to improve my English.”

Classes were not taught in English at the university in the Middle East. But English was Sandra’s native language, and she found it easier to take notes in English. “Here you are,” Sandra said, extending her notebook.

The next day, the classmate again asked for permission to take pictures. After the classmate asked to take pictures for several days in a row, Sandra decided to be more intentional with her notes. She resolved to write favorite Bible verses at the bottom of the pages of her notebook.

The next time the classmate asked to take a picture, however, Sandra felt a jolt of fear. She worried that he would notice the verses and stop asking to see her notes. She prayed that God would use the Bible verses for His glory.

The classmate did not seem to notice the Bible verses at first. But after a couple of days, he realized that the notes contained information that the teacher had not mentioned during the class lectures. He went to Sandra and pointed to a verse at the bottom of a page. “Is this a verse from the Bible?” he asked.

“Yes,” Sandra said, her mind racing as she wondered how to explain it.

The classmate paused. “Is this the way you motivate yourself ?” he asked.

Sandra smiled with relief. “Exactly,” she said. “I write my favorite verses in my notebook. They are always really helpful and useful for my life.”

After that day, the classmate asked Sandra many questions about her religion and beliefs. As they studied together at the university, he also learned about the beliefs of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. At the end of the semester, he asked to make a copy of Sandra’s entire verse-filled notebook. He wanted to share the notes with his siblings.

Although Sandra has not studied with him again, the two have kept in touch, and he regularly asks for advice about life. Sandra is praying for him, his siblings, and the rest of his family. She thanks God for giving her the daring idea to write Bible verses at the bottom of the pages of her notebook.
