The pagan notion of an immortal soul provides the foundation for the unbiblical theory of reincarnation or transmigration of the soul. This theory has been adopted by some major world religions. While most Christians believe in the existence of an immortal soul that abides in a permanent heaven or hell after death, those who believe in reincarnation hold that such an immortal soul goes through many cycles of death and rebirth here on earth.

For some, reincarnation is thought to be a process of spiritual evolution that allows the spirit to attain ever greater levels of knowledge and morality in its journey toward perfection. Hindus believe that the eternal soul goes through a progression of consciousness or “_samsara_” in six classes of life: aquatics, plants, reptiles and insects, birds, animals, and human beings, including the residents of heaven.

`Read Hebrews 9:25–28 and 1 Peter 3:18. If Jesus died just “once” (Heb. 9:28, 1 Pet. 3:18, NKJV) and likewise all human beings die just “once” (Heb. 9:27, NKJV), why do even some alleged Christians believe in some form of reincarnation?`

Many people believe not in what they _should_ believe but in what they _want_ to believe. If a theory brings them existential peace and comfort, that is enough to settle the discussion for them. But for those who take the Bible seriously, there is no way to accept the theory of reincarnation.

First, this theory contradicts the biblical teachings of the mortality of the “soul” and the resurrection of the body (1 Thess. 4:13–18).

Second, it negates the doctrine of salvation by grace through faith in the redemptive work of Jesus Christ (Eph. 2:8–10) and replaces it with human works.

Third, the theory contradicts the biblical teaching that one’s eternal destiny is decided forever by one’s decisions in this life (Matt. 22:1–14, Matt. 25:31–46).

Fourth, this theory downplays the meaning and relevance of Christ’s second coming (John 14:1–3).

And fifth, the theory proposes after-death opportunities for someone still to overcome his or her own life’s pitfalls, which is unbiblical (Heb. 9:27).

In short, there is no place for the idea of reincarnation in the Christian faith.
