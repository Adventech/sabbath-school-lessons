#### Every Cent Is Sacred

_By Andrew McChesney_

Shyamala’s eyes widened with surprise as she read the handwritten note tucked in an envelope with two money orders worth USD 110.52. The letter came from the U.S. East Coast, and the money orders were made out to Global Mission, the frontline arm of Adventist Mission whose missionaries  start new groups of believers in unreached territories.

“I have enclosed a donation to Global Mission to help people learn about the love of God,” the letter read. “I love God and try to help spread the gospel in my neighborhood.”

It was the next part of the note that astonished Shyamala, a donor specialist at Global Mission. The writer explained that the USD 110.52 donation consisted of pennies that she had found on the street. When her jar of pennies got full, she cashed them in and sent the donation.

“This gift is pennies that I collected for Jesus,” she wrote. “I hope it will bring smiles to someone as you share the love of God.”

Another surprising letter arrived at Global Mission’s office at the General Conference a few weeks earlier. The letter, from the U.S. West Coast, contained no note, but the enclosed USD 165 check spoke volumes. It was issued by a prison on behalf of an inmate. With inmates earning up to 55 dollars a month at the prison, the donor would have had to work at least three months for the gift. “And it wasn’t his first donation,” Shyamala said.

A third letter was opened by Nimfa, who, with Shyamala, runs the donor relations department at Global Mission. The letter came from a man who had called Global Mission’s hotline a few days earlier to inquire whether Global Mission had received a donation submitted through its website. Nimfa found that the caller’s bank had rejected the transaction. When the caller asked for an alternative way to donate, she suggested a check or a wire transfer. A check for 70,000 dollars arrived a few days later. The donation was the proceeds from the sale of a piece of property. “The man promised God that if the property sold, he would give everything to mission,” Nimfa said.

Stories about the faithfulness of people to God’s mission deeply touch the hearts of Shyamala, Nimfa, and others who work at Global Mission. Whether the donation is USD 1—one donor has sent three 1-dollar bills every month for years—or USD 70,000, every penny goes to frontline work. “Every cent that we get is no ordinary cent,” Nimfa said. “When we receive a donation, especially when we learn about how that money got to us or why it was sent to us, we are reminded that every cent is sacred. It is the Lord’s money. Every cent goes only to help finish the work so Jesus can come.”
