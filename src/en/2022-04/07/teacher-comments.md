Key Texts: 1 Corinthians 15:4–28, 32, 42, 49–56; Colossians 1:17, 18; Revelation 1:17, 18

#### Part I: Overview

The Cross is Christ’s victory over sin, death, and the devil; and His resurrection is the culminating triumphal event. Death could not retain Jesus, for He never committed sin and was sinless in all His actions. Jesus’ death is the central point of His accomplishments; however, the Cross without the resurrection would become only a beautiful philosophy of unselfish service and have no salvific significance. Furthermore, the Cross without the resurrection would be a demonstration of sacrificial love but have no power to transform lives and bring a decisive solution to the problem of sin and death. It would be incapable of providing eternal life for believers (Rom. 3:21–26).

Christ’s resurrection is crucial. Because of His resurrection, the righteous can be resurrected too. He has, and is, the key to unlocking all the other tombs! The apostle Paul clarifies this truth about Jesus: “And he is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent” (Col. 1:18, ESV). Christ holds a unique and irreplaceable position and authority because He is the Creator. He experienced resurrection from the dead as a result of the cooperation of all the Trinity (John 10:17, 18; Acts 2:24; Rom. 8:11; Gal. 1:1). He has the power to raise people from the dead (John 11:25) because He defeated death. Even though some were resurrected before Him, such as Moses and Lazarus, they were resurrected only in anticipation of Christ’s victorious death (Eph. 1:4, 1 Pet. 1:20, Rev. 13:8). Christ’s perfect life, death, and resurrection are the cause of new life for all who believe in Him. Without His death, there is no eternal life. As through Adam came death, so through Jesus Christ “came also the resurrection of the dead” and in Him “shall all be made alive” (1 Cor. 15:21, 22). Christ is “the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep” (1 Cor. 15:20).

#### Part II: Commentary

**Christ Is Alive**

“Jesus Christ has risen! He is alive!” This pronouncement was definitely the most astonishing and exciting news proclaimed on resurrection day (Mark 16:6, Luke 24:34). Today it is still the most outstanding news of the gospel. Jesus is no longer in the tomb; He was resurrected. Death could not retain Jesus because He was righteous and had never sinned (John 14:30, 2 Cor. 5:21, Heb. 4:15). Christ predicted His death and resurrection several times to His disciples, but they did not understand, for His message made no sense to them at the time (Matt. 16:21; Mark 8:31, 32; Luke 18:31–34). During the Last Supper with His disciples, Jesus announced that He would live again, even though He would be betrayed and die: “ ‘I tell you I will not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom’ ” (Matt. 26:29, ESV; compare with Mark 14:25).

When we partake of the Lord’s Supper, we also signify by our participation that we believe in Christ’s resurrection. As Paul states: “For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes” (1 Cor. 11:26, ESV). When people are baptized, they also confirm their belief in Christ’s resurrection and their desire to live a new life of faith: “All of us . . . have been baptized into Christ. . . . We were buried . . . in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead . . . we too might walk in newness of life” (Rom. 6:3, 4, ESV). Thus, Christian baptism is practiced as the remembrance of Christ’s death, burial, and resurrection.

After more than 60 years, John the apostle met the glorified Jesus. Jesus appeared to John and said: “ ‘I died, and behold I am alive forevermore’ ” (Rev. 1:18, ESV). Christianity is about the life we receive from Jesus because He died for us. He can give this life to us because He was resurrected. Because He lives, He can apply to us everything that He accomplished on the cross through His intercessory ministry in our behalf.

**The Gospel According to the Resurrection (1 Corinthians 15)**

The best explanation of the significance of the resurrection of Jesus Christ is laid out in 1 Corinthians 15, in which the apostle Paul explains why the resurrection of Jesus is so important. First, Paul provides the historical reason and argues that there are many witnesses of Christ’s resurrection. If their testimony is dismissed, then all who testified that they had an encounter with Christ would be false witnesses. Christ appeared to Peter, to the apostles, to James, to 500, and to Paul himself (1 Cor. 15:5–8).

Then Paul engages in theological reasoning in defense of the resurrection and offers several crucial points:

1.	If there were no resurrection of the dead, then even Jesus Christ was not resurrected (1 Cor. 15:13, 16).

2.	If Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain (1 Cor. 15:14).

3.	If Christ has not been raised, then our faith is in vain (1 Cor. 15:14). The Greek adjective _kenos_ also means “useless” or “empty.” Our faith loses its content and power if Jesus is still dead.

4.	If Christ has not been raised, then the dead will not be raised (1 Cor. 15:15). There would be no hope after death.

5.	If Christ has not been raised, we are false witnesses about God, because we testify about God’s raising Christ (1 Cor. 15:15). So if Jesus is not raised from the dead, then the picture of God and His character is distorted, and we are misrepresenting Him. However, the Father truthfully raised Christ from the dead.

6.	If Christ has not been raised, our faith is futile (1 Cor. 15:17). The meaning of the Greek adjective _mataios_ is “worthless.” Our faith in God would have no relevance to our lives.

7.	If Christ has not been raised, there is no forgiveness of our trespasses, and we remain in our sins (1 Cor. 15:17). As sinners, we deserve only the death sentence.

8.	If Christ has not been raised, then there is no resurrection of the dead in Christ (1 Cor. 15:18) and, thus, no eternal life.

9.	If Christ has not been raised, and if only in this life we could hope in Christ, then we are of all people to be most pitied (1 Cor. 15:19). Paul uses the Greek adjective _eleeinos_, which means “miserable.” Thus, if we have only a nice spiritual teaching about Jesus that pertains only to this earthly life, we are most miserable, according to Paul, because Jesus was crucified and died, and so death, inevitably, is the final fate of all.

10.	If the dead are not to be raised, then we should “eat and drink, for tomorrow we die” (1 Cor. 15:32, ESV). Our motto in life should then be carpe diem in order to at least experience a little bit of happiness and joy.

Next, Paul makes a practical observation from the world of agriculture to illustrate the resurrection: “What you sow does not come to life unless it dies” (1 Cor. 15:36, ESV). The seed needs to be first buried in the ground to later produce the new life on a bigger scale (i.e., from the kernel will spring the whole tree). Though our mortal body will die, the imperishable will rise from the dead (1 Cor. 15:42) because of God’s creative power. Then we will “bear the image of the man of heaven” (1 Cor. 15:49, ESV).

At the second coming of Christ (1 Cor. 15:23), those who sleep in the dust will be resurrected and “in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, . . . this perishable body must put on the imperishable, and this mortal body must put on immortality” (1 Cor. 15:52, 53, ESV).

“ ‘Death is swallowed up in victory’ ” (1 Cor. 15:54, ESV; compare with Isa. 25:8). Then Paul writes about the glorious and triumphant shout of victory (the word “victory” is used three times in this last chapter’s section): “ ‘O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?’ ” (1 Cor. 15:55, ESV). Praise the Lord because this victory over death is given to the faithful in Christ Jesus. How grateful we should be (1 Cor. 15:57).

**Hope Proclaimed**

The apostle Paul powerfully reminds the first Christians about those who passed away in faith, hoping in the appearing of Christ at the Second Coming. Paul encourages those who remain not to become desperate or despairing because they, and we, have hope: “But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who are asleep, that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope. For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep. For this we declare to you by a word from the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the sound of the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord. Therefore encourage one another with these words” (1 Thess. 4:13–18, ESV). Notice that at the Second Coming Jesus will not walk on this earth but stay in the air as the righteous dead are resurrected and the living saints transformed. Together they will be taken to meet the Lord in the air to be with Him forever.

Those who die in the Lord do not need to worry about anything because they will live again. John proclaims: “ ‘Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.’ ‘Blessed indeed,’ says the Spirit, ‘that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them!’ ” (Rev. 14:13, ESV).

#### Part III: Life Application

1.	Why is the resurrection of Jesus so important? What if He had merely died for us and had only shown us how to live a life of obedience, unselfish service, and love?

2.	How does the ordinance of baptism celebrate Christ’s resurrection?

3.	What is more important from a theological perspective: Jesus Christ’s prayer in Gethsemane, His death on the cross at Golgotha, or His resurrection? What was, and is, the center of all Christ’s activities, and why?
