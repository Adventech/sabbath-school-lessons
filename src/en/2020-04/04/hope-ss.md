### Outline #4 Discovering a Biblical Worldview

*  Seeking answers for the life’s big questions
	* Where did we come from? What is the meaning and purpose of life?  Why is there so much suffering in the world? What hope is there for the future?
	* There are many answers to those questions, depending on where we go in search of answers.
	* How does the psalmist David summarize two major worldviews? Psalm 53:1-2
	* Share a time when you struggled with some of life’s big questions.
	* If we seek answers to life’s big questions from the Bible, we arrive at a biblical worldview. What answers do the authors of the Scriptures, inspired by the Holy Spirit, give for life’s big questions? (give scriptural support for your response)
		* Where did we come from? Genesis 1:1, Job 12:7-10, Exodus 20:8-11, etc.
		* What is the meaning and purpose of life? Revelation 14:6-7, Matthew 22:37-39, etc.
		* Why is there so much suffering?  Revelation 12:7-12, John 10:10, Ephesians 6:10-12, etc.
		* What hope is there for the future? John 14:1-3, 1 John 5:11-13, Revelation 1:17-18, 21:1-5, etc.
	* How can we build a bridge of understanding with individuals who have a non-biblical worldview?

*  Jesus, the living Center of our biblical worldview
	* What bold claims did Jesus make during His earthly ministry and after His resurrection? John 14:6, John 11:25, Revelation 1:8, 17-18
	* How does testimony of the apostle John reinforce the centrality of Jesus in a biblical worldview? John 1:1-4, 14
	* What declaration did John the Baptist make when he saw Jesus coming toward him?  John 1:29-34
	* Why did the Son of God humble Himself and come into the human family as Jesus of Nazareth, fully God and fully man? Matthew 1:18-21, John 3:16-17
	* When did you come to the realization that Jesus is more than just an important person in world history—He is the living Center of human history?

*  The Word of God as a guide for human conduct
	* In a biblical worldview, the written Word of God is much more than human words about God.  It is the word of God to the human family.  2 Peter 1:16-21
	* Share some Scripture passage that emphasize the importance of the Bible as a guide for human conduct? Psalm 119:105, Matthew 4:4, etc.
