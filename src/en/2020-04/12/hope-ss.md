### Outline #12  Learning to Experience the Sabbath

*  The Sabbath—a gift from our Creator
	* Genesis 2:1-3 – blessed and made holy
		* What was the significance of the Sabbath being the first day Adam and Eve spent with each other and with their Creator?
		* How do you think Adam and Eve experienced their first Sabbath in their Eden home?
	* Exodus 20:8-11 – Why was it necessary to call God’s people to remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy?
	* When did you come to recognize the Sabbath as a precious gift from our loving Creator?

*  The Sabbath—a time of blessing
	* What blessings did the children of Israel experience every week to remind them of the gift of the Sabbath? Exodus 16:1-4, 15-25
	* Isaiah 58:13-14 What is meant by the expression “to call the Sabbath a delight”?
	* Mark 2:27 How did Jesus reinforce the idea that the Sabbath is a time of blessing?
	* Our Creator intended the Sabbath not only to be a time of blessing for us but also a time of blessing through us to others. Share a time when you were able to share a blessing with someone on the Sabbath day.
	* Some people view the Sabbath as a burden rather than a blessing.  How can we help them to experience the Sabbath as a time of blessing?

*  The Sabbath—a time for healing
	* Luke 13:10-17
	* Matthew 12:9-13
	* How do you explain the reaction of the religious leaders, recorded in Matthew 12:14?
	* Jesus focused on the Sabbath as a time to actively seek to do good.  Why do many view the Sabbath simply as a time not to do certain things?

*  The Sabbath—a time for fellowship (koinonia)
	* Luke 4:16 Why did Jesus go to the synagogue every Sabbath?
	* Sometimes we can find fellowship with other Christians on Sabbath in a place of worship. Acts 13:13-15, 42-44, 17:1-4, 18:1-4
	* At other times, we might find fellowship with other believers out in nature. Acts 16:13-14
	* Share a time when you experienced the Sabbath as a special time for fellowship.
	* How can we help others to experience the sense of community God intended on the Sabbath?
