### Outline #5  Learning from Jesus, the Master Teacher

*  Revealing the truth about Father in heaven

	* Hebrews 1:1-4 What was the most important revelation Jesus, the incarnate Son of God, provided for the human family?
	* What bold declaration did Jesus make to Philip and the other disciples? John 14:9 (see also 2 Corinthians 4:6)
	* Why was it so important for Jesus to reveal the truth about our Father in heaven?
	* Jesus called Satan, “a liar and the father of lies.” When did Satan first begin to bring distortions and deceptions about the character of God to the human family? Genesis 3:1-5
	* Share an incident in the life of Jesus when He clearly revealed the truth about the immeasurable, unfailing love of our Father in heaven.
	* According to Jesus, how is it possible today to counteract Satan’s distortions about the character of our Father in heaven? Acts 1:8, Matthew 5:14-16
	* Share a time when you had the opportunity to share the truth about the character of our loving and merciful Father in heaven.

*  Following Jesus, the Master Teacher

	* What example did Jesus provide of full surrender to the will of our Father in heaven?  Philippians 2:5-11
	* Where in the teachings of Jesus do you see a specific call to surrender fully to the will of God? Mark 8:34-37, John 6:38, etc.
	* An important part of the mission of Jesus was to reconcile sinners to God. (Colossians 1:15-22) Share an example of this ministry of reconciliation during the earthly ministry of Jesus.
	* How can we join Jesus in that life-saving mission of reconciliation? 2 Corinthians 5:16-21
	* Share a time when you had the privilege of helping someone be reconciled to God. How did that experience impact your life?
