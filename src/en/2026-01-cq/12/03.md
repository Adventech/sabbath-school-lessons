If you’re a Seventh-day Adventist, you may have heard accusations that the Adventist Church is a cult, with the charges ranging from secret practices to unbiblical teachings. These misunderstandings often arise from misinformation or isolated incidents involving fringe groups, not the official teachings or structure of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

Let’s be frank here: every group and church has cult-like people within it. Broken humans tend to imbibe behaviors and views that contradict biblical principles. There’s not enough space here to examine all the claims made against Adventists, but let’s briefly consider two common accusations.

Critics argue the Adventist Church elevates the writings of Ellen G. White to a level equal to the Bible. However, Ellen White herself wrote, “The Bible, and the Bible alone, is our rule of faith.”<sup>1</sup> Every group may claim to follow the Bible, but the difference here is that hermeneutics is king. Either the Bible can be understood only by an outside authoritative commentator, or it is the ultimate interpreter of itself. This distinction is key, as it quickly filters out false prophets. All so-called authoritative sources must be tested by the Bible rather than held above it. The Adventist Church affirms the Bible as the final authority for faith and practice (_sola scriptura_) and teaches that Ellen White’s writings are not a replacement for Scripture but are considered a prophetic gift (Rev. 19:10) that upholds Scripture and reinforces biblical truths.

Accusers assert that Adventist theology fosters a “remnant mentality” and that Adventists view themselves as the only true Christians, excluding all others. While the Adventist Church claims a prophetic role as part of God’s end-time remnant (Rev. 12:17), it acknowledges that God’s followers exist in all denominations (John 10:16). The focus is on proclaiming biblical truth rather than declaring exclusivity. The “remnant” identification should serve as a humbling designation rather than being meritorious. Pew Research identified the Adventist Church as the most racially diverse group in the United States—a testament to the inclusivity of its mission and message.<sup>2</sup>

While the Adventist Church is not a cult, some isolated groups and individuals claiming affiliation may exhibit cult-like behavior—rigid practices, extreme views, or toxic leadership. Such cases do not reflect the church’s official theology or governance. Interestingly, other popular Christian movements with hierarchical leadership, financial manipulation, and leader worship might fit the cult definition more closely. No denomination is perfect; however, Adventists remain committed to biblical truth and growth.
