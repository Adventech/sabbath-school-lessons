In 1 Kings 10:1–13, we see the Queen of Sheba’s journey to visit King Solomon, whose wisdom and connection with God intrigued her. This story provides deep insights into sharing our faith with others, especially concerning apologetics. Consider the following four practices:

**Build relationships.** The Queen of Sheba traveled a long distance because she had heard about Solomon’s wisdom and his relationship with God. Her curiosity led her to ask him “hard questions” (1 Kings 10:1). Solomon welcomed her, showing the importance of building genuine connections with people who are curious about our beliefs. In apologetics, we aren’t just trying to win arguments or prove points. Instead, like Solomon, we need to create space for others to ask questions. When people feel we care, they’re more likely to listen to what we have to say about God.

**Understand where others are coming from.** The Queen of Sheba came from a different culture, with her own beliefs and experiences. She came to Solomon with questions that reflected her background. Solomon didn’t dismiss her or give short answers; instead, he patiently answered all her questions (1 Kings 10:3). For young adults, it’s important to remember that not everyone who questions our faith does so from a hostile place. Often, people have honest doubts, or their background influences how they view God. This means we don’t throw out quick answers. We listen first, then speak to the heart of their concerns.

**Address both the head and the heart.** The Queen of Sheba wasn’t just looking for intellectual answers; she wanted to see if Solomon’s wisdom was real. “She spoke with him about all that was in her heart” (1 Kings 10:2). After seeing how he lived, she exclaimed, “It was a true report.… However I did not believe the words until I came and saw with my own eyes” (1 Kings 10:6, 7). This tells us apologetics isn’t just about answering questions with facts; it’s also about showing others what following God looks like. Young adults today face a lot of emotional and intellectual barriers to faith. Some may have been hurt by other Christians or they might struggle with tough questions about God’s goodness.

**Point to God’s beauty.** Ultimately, the Queen of Sheba recognized that Solomon’s wisdom came from God. She said, “Blessed be the LORD your God, who delighted in you” (1 Kings 10:9). The goal of apologetics isn’t to win debates or display how much we know; it’s to help others see the beauty of Jesus. Like Solomon, we can live in a way that shows others what having God in our lives truly looks like. In doing so, they will see that following Him is not only right but also deeply fulfilling.
