Malachi 4:1–3 uses strong imagery of the wicked being burned up and reduced to ashes. This final act of destruction leaves nothing behind—“neither root nor branch.” God’s plans to completely eradicate to evil to ensure the peace and purity of His universe. Nahum 1:9 reassures us that “affliction will not rise up a second time.” Evil will not return, and its destruction guarantees that the peace of eternity will not be disrupted. God will put a permanent end to evil while preserving our freedom in the process.

God brings about justice not by endless punishing but by exterminating sin and suffering. Ezekiel 28:18, 19 promises that Satan will be turned to ashes and will “be no more forever.” This is not eternal torment but eternal extinction. Obadiah 1:16 echoes this, saying the wicked will be “as though they had never been.” This final destruction is merciful and aligns with a God of love, who desires to restore peace to His creation.

If eternal hellfire were true, it would distort God’s character and make Him difficult to trust. A God who allows endless suffering would be out of harmony with His law of love (Matt. 22:37–40) and the principles of mercy and forgiveness He commands us to follow. Eternal torment presents God as a tyrant, inflicting infinite, progressive punishment for finite sins. How could we trust God if He violates the character of Himself as revealed in the Gospels? If God demands mercy and compassion from us, how could He act in a way that contradicts His own standards? Such a distorted portrayal of God makes Him hypocritical. This is not the God of the Bible.

The doctrine of eternal torment is incompatible with a God of love, mercy, and justice. Only two destinies are taught in the Bible. People will either “perish” or receive “everlasting life” (John 3:16). There is no middle option. To torment the wicked forever would be to grant them eternal life. God’s plan is to eradicate evil entirely, not prolong suffering.

Eternal life, as promised in the Bible, is a gift given only to those who believe in Christ (Rom. 6:23). True joy in eternity would be impossible if sin and evil were still present, even if confined to a corner of the universe. Imagine living in the light of God’s presence, knowing that somewhere else, suffering continues forever. 1 Corinthians 15:26 tells us that death—the ultimate result of sin—is the “last enemy” to be destroyed. The final destruction of death and evil ensures that eternal life will be free from pain and sorrow.
