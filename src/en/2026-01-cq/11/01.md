**How to Create an Atheist**

Imagine an eternal hell, where flames engulf the damned, searing flesh that never burns away, and where screams of agony echo endlessly in the darkness. In this nightmarish realm, there is no escape, no respite—only ceaseless torment that stretches on forever, without hope or mercy. Every second feels like an eternity, as pain and despair consume the soul. The very thought is horrifying: a place where suffering never ends, where cries for mercy go unanswered, and where the anguish of the condemned becomes a spectacle of divine wrath.

How could a loving, merciful Creator condemn His creation to such a fate? The cruelty of the doctrine of eternal torment seems to shatter the very foundation of God’s character as revealed in Scripture—a God who is just, loving, and merciful.

Charles Darwin, considered to be the founder of the evolutionary theory, reflected on this terrifying concept. He wrote in his autobiography, “I can indeed hardly see how anyone ought to wish Christianity to be true; for if so, the plain language of the text seems to show that the men who do not believe—and this would include my Father, Brother, and almost all my best friends—will be everlastingly punished. And this is a damnable doctrine.”<sup>1</sup> This perspective, along with other issues, contributed to Darwin’s growing skepticism toward Christianity.

Darwin’s words capture the profound moral and theological crisis that the doctrine of eternal hellfire presents—a doctrine so horrifying that it drove him and many others to question the very nature of Christianity itself. Ellen G. White acknowledged the devastating impact of this false teaching:

It is beyond the power of the human mind to estimate the evil which has been wrought by the heresy of eternal torment. The religion of the Bible, full of love and goodness, and abounding in compassion, is darkened by superstition and clothed with terror. When we consider in what false colors Satan has painted the character of God, can we wonder that our merciful Creator is feared, dreaded, and even hated? The appalling views of God which have spread over the world from the teachings of the pulpit have made thousands, yes, millions, of skeptics and infidels.<sup>2</sup>

The book _Deconstructing Hell: Open and Relational Responses to the Doctrine of Eternal Conscious Torment_ explores the harmful effects of the doctrine of eternal conscious torment on both individuals and the broader mission of Christianity.<sup>3</sup> This research highlights that eternal conscious torment is among the most destructive doctrines, contributing to significant religious trauma, fostering atheism, and creating deep-seated fear and mistrust of the character of God.

The teaching of eternal hellfire has been a significant factor in the rise of skepticism and atheism, as many find it irreconcilable with the notion of a just and loving God. Shouldn’t Bible believers speak out against such an appalling, incorrect, and repulsive perspective of God?

The well-known atheist and philosopher Sam Harris stated, “God says do what you wish, but make the wrong choice and you will be tortured for eternity in hell. That’s not free will.… When a man says this we call him a psychopath. When god says the same we call him ‘loving’ and build churches in his honor.”<sup>4</sup> In this sense, couldn’t we agree with the atheist here?

This study will delve into the biblical teachings on hellfire, demonstrating that annihilationism—a final end to evil—is not only the most just and compassionate understanding of divine judgment but also the one most consistent with the character of God as revealed in Scripture. Through careful examination of the Bible and theological reflection, annihilationism will reveal a vision of divine justice that is both merciful and aligned with the true nature of a loving Creator.
