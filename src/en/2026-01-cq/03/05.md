Most atheists today aren’t part of some official atheist club or deeply convinced by scientific arguments. Most don’t have degrees in molecular biology or zoology. Many simply choose not to believe in God. Why? For many people, the idea of God feels like bad news. Throughout history, humans have believed in a lot of gods, many of whom were pretty terrifying. Let’s be real: it’s good news that these gods don’t exist. Why? Because who wants to deal with Zeus trying to seduce your family or Moloch demanding child sacrifices? Or Ares starting wars just because he feels like it? These gods were selfish, cruel, and unpredictable. The world is definitely better off without them. We don’t need to tiptoe around manipulative gods, fearing punishment for every little mistake. Today, no one wakes up thinking, “What does Zeus want from me?” or “What sacrifice should I offer to Moloch?” We don’t stress about Baal’s demands or dodge Thor’s lightning bolts. Living in a world without these gods feels easier, lighter. That leads some people to conclude we’re better off with no God at all.

What about the God of the Bible? Is He just like those other gods? Should we toss Him out too? Or is He different? Here’s where things change. The God of the Bible is unlike any other. In Colossians 1:16, 17, Paul says, “For by Him all things were created.… All things were created through Him and for Him. And He is before all things, and in Him all things consist.” Paul is talking about Jesus. He’s saying that the Creator of the universe is none other than Jesus Christ. Think about that.

The Creator who spoke the world into existence was Jesus.

The Creator who made Adam with His own hands? Jesus.

The Creator who rested on the Sabbath with the first family? Jesus.

The Creator who walked toward Adam and Eve after they sinned? Jesus.

The Creator who promised a Savior? Jesus.

This changes everything. Jesus isn’t a distant, vengeful God in the sky. He’s the Creator, actively involved in the world from the very beginning, and He’s also the Savior who came to rescue us. The amazing truth is that the Creator of the universe is the same God who humbled Himself to walk among us, to heal, to teach, and to ultimately die for us. The God who made us loves us deeply and personally. The good news isn’t just that there’s a God. The good news is that there is a God, and He is Jesus.

### Questions to consider

`Read Psalm 8 and meditate on the significance of the Creator of the universe caring about you.`

`Reflect on how the depiction of Jesus as both Creator and Savior in the Bible differs from the ancient portrayal of other gods.`
