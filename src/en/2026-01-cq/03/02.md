Most pagan creation accounts, which were common in cultures like Babylon, Egypt, and Sumer, have two key features. First, they often start with nature creating the gods. In these stories, gods are born from natural elements like water, the sky, or chaos. For example, the Babylonian Enuma Elish describes a cosmic battle involving primordial waters, and from this chaotic environment, the gods are born and eventually shape the world. Greek, Norse, and Hindu cultures include the same accounts. One might even say atheism, which touts nature as the creator, falls into this category.

The second key feature of pagan creation accounts is that humanity is at the bottom of the creation order, the least important part of creation. In many of these stories, humans are made as an afterthought or to do the gods’ dirty work. For instance, in Babylonian mythology, humans are created from the blood of a defeated god to serve the victorious gods, essentially doing the work the gods don’t want to do. Humans exist to keep the gods happy, and their value is largely utilitarian—they serve the gods’ needs.

In stark contrast, the biblical creation account flips this script entirely. First, God is not born from nature. Instead, God creates nature. The Bible begins with the declaration, “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth” (Gen. 1:1). There’s no chaotic battle between gods or natural forces. God alone speaks everything into existence—light, sky, land, and sea (Gen. 1:3–10). He is Sovereign over all creation, not a product of it. The second—and most significant—difference is that humanity is the most important part of creation. God declared, “Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness” (Gen. 1:26). Humans are not just another creature; they are a reflection of God Himself. Humans weren’t created to serve God in a menial way but were given dominion over all other creatures. Unlike the ancient near eastern myths, where humans are slaves to the gods, the Bible portrays us as stewards and partners with God in caring for the world (Genesis 1:28).

Genesis 2:7 provides an even more intimate look at human creation: “And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.” This act of personally forming man with His own hands and breathing life into him highlights the value and care God places on humanity. In other ancient near eastern stories, humanity is a by-product of chaos or divine laziness. In contrast, the Bible portrays humans as the crowning achievement of creation, fashioned by the hand of God, a revelation of His love.
