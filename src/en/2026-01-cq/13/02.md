Traveling northward to the region of Tyre and Sidon, Jesus journeyed with His disciples outside the borders of Israel to a land with a foreign culture, food, accents, and religion. During this trip, a Canaanite woman approached Jesus, pleading for her daughter to be healed from demon possession. Canaanites came from a background steeped in polytheism. They historically worshiped gods like Baal and Asherah, practicing idolatry and rituals that were starkly opposed to the faith of Israel (Deut. 7:1–5). Despite her pagan background, she recognized something unique about Jesus. Contrary to her culture’s history of brutal cultic practices, such as child sacrifice, this Canaanite woman was determined to save her daughter at all costs.

At first, Jesus seemingly ignores and rejects her, saying, “I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel” (Matt. 15:24). This may seem harsh, but Jesus was creating a moment to teach a lesson. His initial refusal mirrors the disciples’ own attitudes toward the Gentiles. Jesus’ delay is not rejection; it creates a moment for the woman’s faith to shine and exposes the disciples’ narrow understanding of His mission. He is showing the disciples what their favoritism and bigotry look like. Jesus’ unexpected response must have startled the disciples, which is what it was supposed to do.

Though she is a foreigner from another culture, the Canaanite woman recognizes Jesus as the “Son of David,” a title that reveals her understanding of His Messianic identity (Matt. 15:22). Her recognition is remarkable, given her cultural distance from Judaism. Scholar R. T. France comments, “She saw in Jesus something the religious leaders of Israel often missed—compassion and divine power.”<sup>1</sup> Ellen White points out, “Beneath the apparent refusal of Jesus, she saw a compassion that He could not hide.”<sup>2</sup> Rather than taking offense, she persists in belief. Jesus then praises her faith, saying, “O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire” (Matt. 15:28). This moment shows that faith, not ethnicity, brings people into the fold of God’s blessings.

This is the only recorded miracle in this region, a significant event in Jesus’ ministry. The disciples, initially hesitant, witness firsthand that the “lost sheep of the house of Israel” are not limited by ethnicity but by faith. Jesus expands their understanding of His mission, showing that God’s love and grace extend beyond Israel to all who believe. This woman, though culturally an outsider, becomes a true sheep of Israel through her faith.
