**What About Those Who Never Heard?**

As Abraham gazed at the stars glimmering in the night sky, God made a profound promise: “I will multiply your descendants as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is on the seashore; and your descendants shall possess the gate of their enemies. In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice” (Gen. 22:17, 18).

This promise was not only for Abraham’s descendants but for all nations of the earth. Judaism, Christianity, and Islam all revere Abraham, whose name means “father of many.” His life stands as a testament to faithfulness, obedience, and trust in God.

Today, the world is home to roughly 8.2 billion people from various faith backgrounds, including:

- 2.5 billion Christians
- 1.9 billion Muslims
- 1.1 billion Hindus
- 531 million Buddhists<sup>1</sup>

Despite Christianity being the largest religion, many Christians do not fully adhere to biblical teachings, and only a small minority actively share the gospel. This context raises important questions: How does God work to save the nations amidst religious confusion and limited missionary efforts? How does He judge those who have never heard the gospel? What about nations not mentioned in the Bible?

Inspiration provides insight into these questions. Ellen G. White articulated God’s inclusive nature when she wrote:

Heaven’s plan of salvation is broad enough to embrace the whole world.… And He will not permit any soul to be disappointed who is sincere in his longing for something higher and nobler than anything the world can offer. Constantly He is sending His angels to those who, while surrounded by circumstances the most discouraging, pray in faith for some power higher than themselves to take possession of them and bring deliverance and peace. In various ways God will reveal Himself to them and will place them in touch with providences that will establish their confidence in the One who has given Himself a ransom for all.<sup>2</sup>

This paints a broader picture of a God, who is more loving than many realize. God works in various ways with different people, often revealing Himself through nature and personal experiences. While Scripture provides the clearest revelation of God, He communicates with those who lack access to it in ways they can understand.

God is not limited by borders, languages, or even access to written Scripture. He has placed within creation a testimony that speaks to all people—regardless of where they live or what they know. The stars, the mountains, the changing seasons—all proclaim His character. Nature declares His glory without words, yet its message reaches every corner of the earth (Ps. 19:1–4). In every heart, God has planted a desire for Him. Even those without a Bible can perceive His presence through the world He made and this longing He has placed in the human heart (Acts 17:26, 27). Individuals and cultural groups who have never encountered a Bible or a missionary will be judged according to their response to the light given to them.

The human missionary is God’s preferred method for spreading the gospel. In Christ’s parting words to the disciples, He said: “Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you” (Matt. 28:19, 20). God’s ideal is that human beings will share the gospel with the world. However, He is not limited by people. If no missionary reaches those seeking light in deprived areas, God has other ways to reveal Himself. God’s providence reaches everybody. Throughout history, God has used dreams, nature, and even animals to communicate His lessons. Jesus said that if human beings were silent, “the stones would immediately cry out” (Luke 19:40).

God is the ultimate missionary, and we cooperate with Him in His mission. This study will focus on various ways and means God has used to send the light of truth throughout the world in all ages.
