Alvin Plantinga once said, “This overwhelming display of love and mercy [i.e., Jesus’ sacrifice] is not merely the greatest story ever told; it is the greatest story that _could_ be told.”<sup>1</sup> We have a story to tell!

Jesus said, “For I tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see what you see, and have not seen it” (Luke 10:24). For thousands of years, countless people longed for the day when the promised Messiah would arrive. Whether it was the Jewish people clinging to prophecies, or wise men from distant lands like Persia, the hope of a coming Redeemer was alive in their hearts. Many passed away before seeing the fulfillment of this promise, but throughout history, God provided glimpses of the Savior to come.

In the Garden of Eden, after humanity’s fall, God provided the first glimmer of hope to Adam and Eve: a promise of a “Seed” that would one day crush the serpent’s head (Gen. 3:15), symbolizing Christ’s ultimate victory over sin and death. Generations later, Abraham witnessed another sign when God provided a ram caught in a thicket as a substitute for his son Isaac (Gen. 22:13). This event foreshadowed Jesus, the ultimate Sacrifice who would take our place on the cross.

Jacob, in his dream, saw a ladder stretching between heaven and earth, with angels ascending and descending on it (Gen. 28:12). This ladder symbolized Christ, the bridge between God and humanity, which Jesus confirmed in John 1:51.

Moses saw a symbol of salvation when God instructed him to raise a bronze serpent on a pole, so that all who looked upon it would be healed from their deadly snake bites (Num. 21:8, 9). Jesus likened this to His own crucifixion, where He would be lifted up to heal humanity from sin (John 3:14).

The Israelites saw Christ prefigured in the sanctuary system. Every sacrificial lamb offered in the temple pointed forward to the Lamb of God, who would one day take away the sin of the world (John 1:29). The Passover lamb, whose blood saved the Israelites from death in Egypt, also symbolized Christ’s blood that saves us from eternal death.

Today, we live in the fulfillment of these ancient prophecies. We have the full story of Jesus—His coming, His sacrifice, and His resurrection. Jesus is truly the “Desire of All Nations” (Hag. 2:7), the One who came to reveal the Father to us (John 14:9). He is “God with us” (Matt. 1:23). Not just God for us, behind us, in front of us, but with us. Through Jesus, God is with humanity.

We have a story to tell!

Reflection Question:

**Questions to consider:**

`How does recognizing Jesus as “God with us” influence your daily life and relationship with God?`

`What does it mean that Jesus is the “Desire of All Nations?”`
