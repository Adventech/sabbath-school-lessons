**Grave Robber**

In the early hours of Sunday morning, as the first light of dawn crept over the horizon, the world witnessed an event that would forever change the course of history—the resurrection of Jesus Christ. A mighty angel rolled away the stone that sealed His tomb, and the One who is the Resurrection and the Life strode forth in victory over death, leaving empty the grave that once held Him. This moment marked the triumph of life over death, hope over despair, and the ultimate defeat of sin.

The resurrection sets Jesus apart from every other religious leader in history. While Siddhartha Gautama (Buddha) taught his followers to escape suffering through their own efforts, and Muhammad, the founder of Islam, delivered what Muslims believe to be God’s final revelation, both remain in their graves. Similarly, Confucius, the great Chinese philosopher, died and was buried, with his teachings living on through his disciples but without any claim of resurrection. Zoroaster, the founder of Zoroastrianism, also passed away without any reports of returning from the dead.

Jesus alone claimed and demonstrated victory over death. This unique event not only validates His teachings but also offers a promise no other religious leader can: the hope of eternal life. Some view the cross as a defeat and the resurrection as the victory, but the gospel teaches that the cross was the moment of victory, and the resurrection was the certification of that victory—proof that sin had been defeated.

The resurrection is not just an event; it is the cornerstone of the Christian faith. It is the definitive proof that Jesus is who He claimed to be: the Son of God, with power over life and death. As George Hardy powerfully states, there are two questions that matter: “1. Has anyone cheated death and proved it? 2. Is it available to me?”<sup>1</sup>

The resurrection of Jesus answers these questions with a resounding yes. Jesus didn’t just cheat death—He conquered it entirely and offers that victory to all who believe in Him. This is the essence of the Christian message: through Jesus, eternal life is not merely a possibility but a guaranteed gift available to all who accept it.

Why does the story of the empty tomb matter so much? The empty tomb signifies that death does not have the final say. It is a powerful reminder that just as Jesus was raised from the dead, so too will His followers be raised to eternal life. This hope transforms the way Christians view life and death, providing assurance and comfort in the face of mortality. The curse that fell upon Adam because of his sin, decimating the human race for thousands of years, is finally broken.

On that morning, the angel at the empty tomb told the disciples, “I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified. He is not here; for He is risen” (Matt. 28:5, 6). This is the only time in history when Jesus’ absence was _good news_.

Good news? His empty tomb is good news for us all because His empty tomb means our empty tomb one day.

In this lesson, we will explore the implications of the resurrection, dive into the apologetic evidence that supports it, and uncover the profound hope it offers. The resurrection is more than a doctrine; it is foundational to the Christian faith, offering a new perspective on life and the assurance of a future hope. It is the reason Christians can face the future with confidence, knowing that the victory won by Jesus is a victory shared by all who believe.
