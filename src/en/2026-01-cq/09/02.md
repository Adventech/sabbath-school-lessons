From the perspective of Jesus’ followers, the Sunday morning of the resurrection began with tear-stained eyes, broken hearts, loneliness, and deep reflection. Mary came to the tomb with a single purpose: to anoint Jesus’ body (Mark 16:1). There were no thoughts of logistics, no prepared speeches, and no grand plans. She came simply with a broken heart, longing to care for the One who had cared so deeply for her.

This is the same Mary whom Jesus had freed from seven demons (Luke 8:2), a woman who had experienced incredible healing through His love. She knew both the depths of brokenness and the heights of redemption. It’s been said, “hurt people hurt, but loved people love,” and in Mary’s case, waves of love had washed over her until it healed her soul. Her devotion to Jesus was undeniable. She was one of the last at the cross on Friday and the first at the tomb on Sunday.

To her shock, the tomb was open and empty. Feeling crushed, confused, and desperate, Mary stood outside the tomb, weeping and weeping (John 20:11). She had already endured so much, and now it seemed as though Jesus was gone forever. The possibilities of what might have happened to Jesus’ body overwhelmed her.

In her sorrow, a voice spoke to her. It was Jesus, lingering to comfort her. At first, in her grief, she didn’t recognize Him. It wasn’t until He called her by name, “Mary” (John 20:16), that her eyes were opened.

Imagine the significance of the moment! The instant she heard her name and saw her Savior, everything changed forever. Her whole universe was reframed. Her worst nightmare turned into something far better than she could possibly dream of. Her life could never be the same again.

Before ascending to the Father, before informing His disciples, Jesus paused to comfort this broken-hearted woman. He momentarily delayed the certification of His cosmic victory to tend to one hurting soul. Because Jesus’ mission has always been people, He cared deeply for individuals like Mary. Jesus knew Mary’s story, the depths of her pain, and in this tender encounter, He shows us that our hurt never goes unnoticed (Ps. 34:18). His love isn’t just for the masses; it’s personal.

Mary had been rescued from the depths of sin. Because she knew her need for a Savior, she was the first to acknowledge the meaning of Christ’s sacrifice (Matt. 26:12), and the first to recognize His resurrection. Her story reminds us that grace always meets us where we are, but it never leaves us there. This truth applies to you, reader.
