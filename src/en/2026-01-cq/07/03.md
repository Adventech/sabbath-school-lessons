Both Islam and Judaism are staunchly monotheistic, sharing a deep reverence for Abraham as a pivotal figure in their histories. Islam holds that Abraham’s promised son, through whom the covenant would be fulfilled, was Ishmael, while Judaism asserts it was Isaac. Scripture presents a revelation that transcends this religious controversy: there is another Promised Seed of Abraham—Jesus.

Abraham eagerly anticipated Jesus’ first coming. Jesus explained this to the Jews: “Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it and was glad” (John 8:56). Jesus spoke these words in the temple, which was near the place Abraham had been called to sacrifice his son, Isaac, two millennia before. Abraham believed God would “provide for Himself the lamb” (Gen. 22:8), and, sure enough, Isaac was spared because of a ram caught in a thicket, symbolizing God’s future provision of the ultimate Sacrifice.

Jesus’ identity took on even greater significance when He declared, “Before Abraham was, I AM” (John 8:58). This statement was not merely a claim to preexistence; it was an assertion of His divinity, echoing God’s self-identification to Moses in the burning bush—“I AM WHO I AM” (Exod. 3:14). The Jews were ready to stone Jesus because they understood precisely whom He was declaring Himself to be: the God of the Old Testament. Standing before them was the One on whom their entire history and worship centered. Jesus is not merely a prophet or a good teacher; He is God Himself, the Eternal One. As Ellen G. White aptly states, “In Christ is life, original, unborrowed, underived.”–Ellen G. White, _The Desire of Ages_ (1898), 530. Jesus was not created; He does not have a point of origin.

Scripture emphatically declares the unparalleled nature of God: “You are great, O LORD GOD. For there is none like You, nor is there any God besides You” (2 Sam. 7:22). This assertion firmly establishes God’s unique divinity. The Bible delineates a clear, absolute distinction between God the Creator and all creation. Just as one cannot be somewhat pregnant—one is either pregnant or not—so one cannot possess divinity in degrees. One is either fully divine, and thus God, or not divine at all.

Jesus, along with the Father and the Spirit, undertook a distinct role to bridge the chasm between Creator and creation, a gap made even greater by sin. The term “Son” in this sense is not a biological or physical description but a relational role. The Father, Son, and Spirit are on the same side in their mission to save humanity. What can we tell Muslims about the Christian view of Jesus? It’s not that God birthed a Son, but that God _became_ a Son.

`What questions emerge when comparing Deuteronomy 6 with Jesus’ claims in John 8:56–58?`

`How does Jesus being God reshape our understanding of who God is?`

`Why do you think people are hostile against Jesus’ claims? See John 8:59, for example.`
