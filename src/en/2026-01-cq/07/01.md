**Who Is God?**

Muhammad, born into the prominent and influential Quraysh tribe in Mecca around A.D. 570, is considered the founder of Islam. Sadly, he experienced significant loss early in life, losing his father before his birth and his mother when he was only six years old. Muslims believe that at the age of forty, Muhammad received his first revelation from God through the angel Gabriel. These revelations, which continued over the next twenty-three years, were later compiled into the Quran, the holy book of Islam.

Muhammad’s message of monotheism (belief in one God) and social reform posed a significant challenge to the prevailing socio-religious order of Mecca, particularly to its entrenched polytheism (belief in many gods) and the power structures of the tribal system. The conflict between Muhammad and the Meccan tribes escalated as he rejected their pantheon of gods and condemned the corruption he perceived in Meccan society. His message attracted a growing number of followers, but it also led to severe persecution and hostility from those who viewed it as a threat to their established way of life.

In A.D. 622, facing increasing persecution, Muhammad and his followers migrated to Medina, an event known as the Hijrah, which marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar. In Medina, he established a Muslim community and continued to receive revelations. His efforts to spread his message in Medina combined with his strategic and diplomatic skills eventually led to the unification of the Arabian peninsula’s tribes under Islam, replacing polytheistic practices with the worship of one God. Today, Islam is the second-largest religion in the world, with nearly two billion followers,<sup>1</sup> making up about 25% of the global population. Its influence spans continents, with significant populations in the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia.

In Islam, Jesus is revered as one of the greatest prophets, born to the virgin Mary in a miraculous birth. The Quran affirms Jesus’ prophethood, His miracles, and His character. However, it strongly emphasizes that Jesus was a human being and a servant of God, not divine or the Son of God. The Quran also teaches that Jesus will return to earth before the day of judgment, restoring justice and defeating antichrists. However, His return is not seen as a second coming to fulfill salvation, as in Christianity, but as a final sign of the end times, when He will live as a righteous Muslim leader.

One Christian apologist noted, “The central difference between Islam and Christianity is not in the moral teachings, which often overlap, but in the nature of God and how He relates to human beings.”<sup>2</sup> Who is God? Is He three in one? One in three? Only one? Three Gods? Was Jesus more than a prophet? Was He divine?

Who Jesus is may be the most important question we’ll ever encounter. What we believe about Him shapes everything—our views on life, heaven, salvation, and even how we handle relationships. It impacts how we make choices, see our purpose, and live our everyday lives. Understanding Jesus forms the foundation for everything that really matters.

In this study, we will explore how Jesus speaks to the heart of every person, Muslim or Christian. We will also examine Muhammad’s sensitivity to polytheism and whether this concern should influence our understanding of God. Most importantly, we will explore what Jesus said about His own identity. In these theological conversations, we should never forget the great love and care God has for every human being, and our tone should always reflect that. Let’s compare Muhammad’s teachings with Jesus’ claims to uncover the truth about who Jesus really is.
