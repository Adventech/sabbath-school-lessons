What could convince someone from an atheistic or different faith background that the Bible is reliable? Recent scholarship and evidence provide compelling reasons:

**Documentation:** The New Testament has an unparalleled level of manuscript support, with over 5,800 ancient manuscripts in the Greek language alone (24,000 in total, when including Latin and other ancient translations<sup>1</sup>). Some manuscripts, such as the John Rylands Papyrus (P52), which contains a fragment of the Gospel of John, date as early as A.D. 100–125, only decades after the events it describes. In comparison, around 1,800 manuscripts of Homer’s Iliad remain, with the earliest copies dating to 500 years after the original work. No other historical book can match the Bible’s level of manuscript evidence. _Not even close_. F.F. Bruce, British academic, once stated, “If the New Testament were a collection of secular writings, their authenticity would generally be regarded as beyond all doubt.”<sup>2</sup>

**Archaeology:** Archaeological findings consistently confirm the Bible’s historical and geographical accuracy. Lawrence Mykytiuk, a biblical archaeologist, identified over fifty biblical figures<sup>3</sup> through inscriptions and archaeological discoveries. These include King David, confirmed through the Tel Dan Stele, and Pontius Pilate, verified through the Pilate Stone found in Caesarea. Another important discovery, the Cyrus Cylinder,<sup>4</sup> supports the biblical account of Cyrus the Great permitting the Jews to return to Jerusalem, aligning with passages from Isaiah and Ezra.

**Prophecies:** The Bible is filled with prophecies that were historically fulfilled. Hundreds of Messianic prophecies, like Micah 5:2, which predicted the Messiah’s birth in Bethlehem, and Isaiah 53, describing the suffering servant, were fulfilled in the life of Jesus.

**Extra-biblical sources:** Historical accounts outside the Bible also confirm its events. Tacitus, a Roman historian, references the crucifixion of Jesus under Pontius Pilate in his Annals.<sup>5</sup> Similarly, Josephus, a Jewish historian, mentions Jesus and John the Baptist in his Antiquities of the Jews,<sup>6</sup> verifying the New Testament record. These independent sources provide external validation for key biblical narratives.

**Cultural appeal:** The Bible is the most translated and distributed book in history. According to the Wycliffe Bible Translators organization, portions of the Bible have been translated into over 3,500 languages, making it accessible to people worldwide.<sup>7</sup> Its teachings have profoundly influenced human rights, legal systems, and moral frameworks across various cultures. From the abolition of slavery to modern human rights movements, the Bible’s cultural and moral influence is unparalleled.

**Transformative evidence:** The Bible’s transformative impact is evident through centuries of personal and societal change. See inVite section.

`What categories of evidence do you think are the strongest in helping skeptics recognize the trustworthiness of the Bible? What evidence do you think is the weakest?`

`What evidence would you add that is not mentioned?`

_Memorize your favorite passage from Luke 24:13–35. Write it out multiple times to help with memorization._
