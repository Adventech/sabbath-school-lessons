**Read This Lesson’s Passage:** Luke 24:13–35

### inTro

C.S. Lewis once said, “Thirst was made for water; inquiry for truth.”<sup>1</sup> This statement beautifully captures the essence of the human journey—a deep quest for meaning and understanding, driven by a longing for truth. Throughout history, humans have sought answers through philosophy, religion, and science. Perhaps nowhere was this thirst for knowledge more evident than in the ancient Library of Alexandria, one of the greatest intellectual hubs of antiquity.

Established in the third century B.C. under the Ptolemaic dynasty, the Library of Alexandria was the most renowned repository of knowledge in the ancient world. At its peak, it housed between 200,000 and 700,000 scrolls, ranging from literary works to scientific treatises and religious texts. Among these were the works of Homer and writings by philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, and Socrates, which formed the foundation of ancient Greek philosophy. It also housed scientific works by thinkers like Euclid, the father of geometry, and Archimedes, known for his contributions to physics and engineering. Beyond Greek literature and science, the library collected knowledge from across the world. It contained texts from Egyptian, Babylonian, Persian, and Indian cultures, making it a hub of global wisdom and intellectual exchange.

One of the most significant works stored there was the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, which is believed to have been completed in Alexandria. This translation was significant because it was likely the version of the Old Testament that Jesus Himself would have used and quoted during His ministry.

This quest for truth, evident in the works housed in the Library of Alexandria, mirrors humanity’s broader search for answers across religious and philosophical landscapes. Throughout history, numerous religious texts have attempted to provide spiritual answers, from the Bhagavad Gita of Hinduism to the Quran of Islam and the Tripitaka of Buddhism. While each of these texts offers unique perspectives, the Bible stands out for its historical reliability, internal coherence, and transformative power.

The Bible is a broad collection of 66 books written by over 40 different authors, spanning 1,500 years. These authors came from diverse backgrounds—kings, generals, fishermen, and farmers—representing all walks of life. This diversity of authorship contributes to the Bible’s richness and depth, as it reveals God interacting with humanity across various contexts and time periods.

The Bible presents a unified narrative with a single truth: God’s redemptive plan through Jesus Christ. What makes the Bible unique compared to other religious texts is its consistent focus on Jesus Christ. From Genesis to Revelation, every book ultimately points to Jesus. In fact, Jesus Himself said, “You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which testify of Me” (John 5:39). This means that the Bible is not just a collection of stories or moral teachings; it is a direct testimony of who Jesus is and what He came to accomplish. In Jesus, we see the greatest and most complete picture of God.

The Bible––a revelation of God given to us through real people who lived in real places and who had real experiences with a very real God––offers us a clear path to understanding God’s heart, His love, and His plan for redemption. It stands as a historical document, filled with evidence of God’s presence and His relationship with humanity, yet its power goes beyond history—it transforms lives.

This lesson will explore the reliability of the Scriptures, their meaning for us today, and their profound impact on individuals and cultures. We will dive into the historical and archaeological evidence that supports the Bible, but we will also reflect on its transformative power—how Scripture changes lives and shapes entire communities. Our goal is to deepen our appreciation for the Bible as a reliable, life-changing text that continues to speak to us today, just as it has throughout history. By examining the Bible’s consistency, its central message about Jesus, and its unparalleled impact on the world, we will uncover the true depth of God's Word and its role as the ultimate source of truth in our lives.
