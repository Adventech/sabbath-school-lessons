In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna teaches about dharma (duty) and outlines the roles of the four varnas (social classes): Brahmins (priests), Kshatriyas (warriors), Vaishyas (traders), and Shudras (laborers). Over time, these teachings have been interpreted as a divine endorsement of the caste system, assigning each person specific roles based on their birth. This system has shaped Indian society for centuries, creating a rigid social hierarchy where one’s caste determines their duties and opportunities.

The caste system has led to significant social issues like discrimination, exclusion, and inequality. Those in lower castes, particularly the Dalits (the “untouchables” who are excluded from the four-fold caste system listed above), have faced severe stigma and have been denied access to education, employment, medical treatment and other basic needs. Despite efforts to legally reform caste-based discrimination, the effects are still deeply felt today. Many remain trapped in the roles they were born into, unable to rise above their social class.

In contrast, Jesus’ teachings and ministry were radically inclusive, breaking down social barriers. Jesus interacted with people from all walks of life, especially those whom society marginalized or despised. He treated everyone with dignity, regardless of their social standing. One striking example of Christ’s respect for all is found in John 4, when Jesus spoke with the Samaritan woman at the well. In doing so, He crossed gender, religious, and ethnic boundaries, demonstrating that God’s love extends to all people. Similarly, in the parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25–37), Jesus emphasized that love for one’s neighbor transcends social, ethnic, and religious divisions. His message was clear: in God’s kingdom, everyone is valued equally.

Ellen G. White strongly opposed social hierarchies as well. She wrote, “Christ came to break down every wall of partition. He came to show that His gift of mercy and love is as unconfined as the air, the light, or the showers of rain that refresh the earth.”–Ministry of Healing (1905), 25. White emphasized that Jesus’ love is for all people, regardless of their background or social status. Christians are called to follow Jesus’ example, living out principles of equality and love. Paul affirmed this truth: “There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Gal. 3:28). This verse reflects the heart of the gospel, which unites people across every social and ethnic divide.

Revelation 14:6 describes the gospel being proclaimed to “every nation, tribe, tongue, and people.” This message is the most antiracist message in the world. The gospel challenges hierarchies like the caste system and calls believers to create a community in which every person is valued and loved, reflecting the inclusive nature of God’s kingdom.
