**The One Who Brings Death or the One Who Brings Life**

Imagine a vast battlefield in ancient India, the air thick with tension as two massive armies prepare for war. In the center of this battlefield stands Arjuna, a mighty warrior, filled with doubt and moral confusion. Facing his kinsmen, teachers, and friends on the opposing side, Arjuna is paralyzed with fear and sorrow, unsure of the righteousness of the battle before him. At this critical moment, Krishna, his mysterious charioteer, reveals his divine nature. He begins a profound discourse, known as the Bhagavad Gita, addressing Arjuna’s inner turmoil. Krishna teaches him about his duty (called dharma) as a warrior, the importance of righteousness, and the need for devotion. He encourages Arjuna to rise above his doubts and perform his duty in this battle: to fight without attachment to the results.

This is the Mahabharata, an epic mythological story featuring the Bharata dynasty. It chronicles the great war of humans, gods, and beliefs. This story poem, one of the longest in the world, forms a cornerstone of Hindu belief and culture. The third-largest religion in the world, Hinduism has over 1.2 billion adherents, primarily in India and Nepal. Its cultural and spiritual influence cannot be understated.

Krishna is a major deity in Hinduism, worshiped as the eighth avatar of the deity Vishnu and also regarded as the Supreme Being. He is revered for his protection, compassion, tenderness, and love. The stories of Krishna’s life present him as a god-child, prankster, divine hero, and universal supreme being. These narratives are found in the Mahabharata and the Bhagavad Gita.

Three of the main tenets of Hinduism are 1. samsara (the cycle of rebirth), the continuous reincarnation cycle of life, death, and rebirth; 2. karma (action and consequence), the belief that people’s actions determine their future in this life or the next; and 3. moksha (liberation), the ultimate goal of freeing the soul from the cycle of reincarnation to achieve union with the divine. The Hindu religious texts reflect these tenets. For example, in the Bhagavad Gita, specifically in chapter 11, verse 32, Krishna reveals his universal form to the warrior Arjuna during the Kurukshetra War. At this moment of divine revelation, Krishna declares, “I am Time, the destroyer of all; I have come to consume the world.” This statement reflects Krishna’s role as the cosmic force governing the cycle of creation, preservation, and destruction within the universe.

In contrast, Jesus made several profound declarations about Himself in the New Testament, one of the most significant being in John 14:6: “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.” Here, Jesus identified Himself as the source of eternal life. He doesn’t offer just a physical existence, but a renewed spiritual life that transcends death.  Jesus came into this world to destroy death (1 Cor. 15:26). He is the One who holds the keys to death (Rev. 1:18). Death has no power to hold anybody in the presence of Jesus. He is life, He gives life, and He restores life. To everyone who is willing to listen and follow, Jesus Christ offers Himself as the path to eternal life. He is the way to life because He is life. And He is the way to God because He is God.

This lesson explores the biblical teaching on salvation, contrasting it with the Hindu concepts of reincarnation and karma. We will also look at two of the world’s most influential religious figures and reveal the transformative power of the gospel. This is more than just a comparison; it’s an invitation to discover the profound hope and assurance found in Jesus Christ. Join us as we uncover the compelling reasons the gospel shines as the ultimate source of truth and salvation.

### Apologetics Challenge

In some places around the world, religion is part of many believers’ cultural identity. How do you share the gospel with someone who is from that type of culture?
