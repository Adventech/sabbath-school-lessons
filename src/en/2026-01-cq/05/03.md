Reincarnation, a core belief in Hinduism, teaches that the soul moves through a perpetual cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. Karma, the accumulated results of past actions, determines one’s status in each new life. Individuals face consequences for actions from past lives without having any memory of these actions. This raises concerns about justice. How can someone be held accountable for deeds they cannot remember? The Bible, in contrast, presents justice as direct and fair, where each person is accountable to God for their own actions. Romans 14:12 says, “So then each of us shall give account of himself to God.” Biblical theology teaches that divine justice is satisfied either through forgiveness in Christ or through eternal separation from God at the final judgment.

Another issue is that reincarnation involves an endless cycle with no clear beginning or end. Christianity, however, teaches that every soul is created by God, lives one earthly life, and then faces the judgment. Hebrews 9:27 affirms this idea, saying, “It is appointed for men to die once, but after this the judgment.” This clear beginning and end give purpose to life. Biblical Christianity teaches that our eternal destiny is determined by our choices in this life.

The issue of personal identity also arises. In reincarnation, a person changes in each life—new memories, new experiences, and new forms, making it difficult to maintain a continuous identity. This raises more questions. If identity changes with each life, how can a person truly know who they are? In contrast, Christianity teaches that God made each person unique, with their identity preserved throughout life and into eternity. Psalm 139:13 says, “For You formed my inward parts; You covered me in my mother’s womb.” Christianity celebrates the unbroken thread of personal identity woven by God’s hand.

Finally, salvation in Hinduism is uncertain, as the soul must pass through countless lifetimes to attain escape. The burden of perfectionism and the uncertainty of liberation would haunt most people. The gospel, however, offers assurance of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. John 5:24 promises, “He who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life.” Christianity offers a clear path to salvation—one that’s available to all.
