The story of Job is a powerful testament to God’s faithfulness, even amid intense suffering. Scripture meticulously details Job’s family and possessions before and after his trials. Job was a very wealthy man who loved his seven sons and three daughters. His possessions included “seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very large household” (Job 1:3). Job lost all as one calamity followed another. Job suffered unimaginable hardship, but his story concludes with a profound restoration.

By the end of his ordeal, Job’s material wealth had doubled in all areas except the number of his children (Job 42:12, 13). The number of his new children remained the same as before. Perhaps this trajectory of “doubles” is a subtle indication that Job’s ultimate restoration will occur in eternity, where he will be reunited with both his first and second sets of children. In this way, Job’s story points forward to a greater restoration that touches the eternal. What Job lost on earth will be fully restored to him in heaven, emphasizing the biblical promise that God will not only heal our wounds but exceed our greatest expectations.

Job longed for his story to be heard, exclaiming, “Oh, that my words were written! Oh, that they were inscribed in a book!” (Job 19:23). Little did Job know his story would, indeed, be recorded, offering hope and insight to countless others. The ending of his story will take place at the Second Coming, when he will be reunited with his loved ones and realize that he was part of an even greater narrative: the story of redemption.

The story of Job would be incomplete without the story of Jesus. At Calvary, Satan’s lies were exposed for what they were—deceptions aimed at separating humanity from the love of their Creator. The cross forever silenced the accusation that God is not good. Jesus’ sacrifice revealed the depths of divine love—a love that would rather endure death than see His creatures lost .

In the light of Calvary, we see that love does, indeed, exist, the law is perfectly just and unchanging, and God’s goodness toward His creatures is beyond measure. The cross stands as the eternal testament that God is both just and the justifier, forever silencing the lies of the enemy and revealing the truth of who God is—a God of mercy, justice, and unending goodness.

**Questions to consider:**

`To what extent were Job’s losses restored in this world, and how much will be restored only in eternity?`

`How do the events at the cross answer accusations against God’s character?`
