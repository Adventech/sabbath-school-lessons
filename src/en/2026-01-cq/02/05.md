Ellen G. White provided powerful insights into why Paul’s message met with limited success among the Athenians in Acts 17. She explained it was largely because of the pride of intellect and human wisdom that dominated Athenian society: “The worldly-wise men who come to Christ as poor lost sinners, will become wise unto salvation; but those who come as distinguished men, extolling their own wisdom, will fail of receiving the light and knowledge that He alone can give.”–Ellen G. White, _The Acts of the Apostles_ (1911), 240. Paul, as he encountered the Epicureans and Stoics, understood the difficulty of presenting the gospel to those who thought of themselves as intellectually superior. He approached them with tact and humility, acknowledging their religiosity but revealing their need for the one true God. Despite his efforts, few accepted the message. “And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked, while others said, ‘We will hear you again on this matter.’ So Paul departed from among them. However, some men joined him and believed, among them Dionysius the Areopagite, a woman named Damaris, and others with them” (Acts 17:32–34).

Even though Paul’s ministry in Athens did not produce large numbers of converts, his labors were not in vain. All believers will face people who reject the gospel. We can draw a parallel between Paul’s experience and that of Jesus, who also encountered rejection, particularly from those who thought themselves wise in the ways of the world. These two sets of experiences serve as a reminder that success in sharing the gospel isn’t always measured in numbers or popularity.

There will always be some who reject the gospel, but we must do everything possible to ensure that before they make that decision, they understand what they are rejecting. Additionally, though we will face rejection, we must not become discouraged. In God’s eyes, even one soul is of immense value. Jesus often crossed lands and seas to reach just one person. One soul saved is a victory that holds eternal significance, and no effort is wasted when done for Christ. Ultimately, we are called to persevere in sharing the gospel, even when the results seem insignificant. Just as Paul remained faithful in Athens despite the challenges, we too must continue to spread the light of truth, trusting that God will reach those whose hearts are open. In the eyes of heaven, the value of one soul is worth all our efforts.

**Questions to consider:**

`How can you remain encouraged in difficult fields (e.g., colleges, workplaces, challenging home situations)?`

`Do you know someone who’s working hard to share the gospel? What could you do to encourage them?`
