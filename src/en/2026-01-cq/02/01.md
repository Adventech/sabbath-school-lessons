**The Altar to the Unknown God**

The graying man in humble garments stepped into the center of the Areopagus, the ancient court and meeting place of the Athenian elite. Around him, philosophers and curious onlookers gathered, eager to hear this foreign preacher who spoke of strange new gods. The sunlight filtered through the columns, casting long shadows on the marble stones as Paul began to speak in a calm and steady voice: “Men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are very religious” (Acts 17:22). He had walked through their city, observing the many altars and statues dedicated to a myriad of gods. One altar in particular had caught his eye: an altar inscribed “TO THE UNKNOWN GOD” (v. 23) Using this as his entry point, Paul sought to connect with the Athenians on a spiritual and intellectual level. He said, in essence, “This God, whom you worship without knowing, is the One I am proclaiming to you.” Paul’s encounter at Mars Hill (the Areopagus) offers a profound example of engaging with different worldviews and presenting the gospel in a contextually relevant manner. Paul’s speech at Mars Hill is a masterful blend of cultural engagement and theological clarity. He began by acknowledging the Athenians’ beliefs and quoting from common sayings in their religion.

To avoid offending any deity they might not know, the Greeks sometimes built altars to unknown gods as a form of religious inclusivity. The Greek traveler and geographer Pausanias mentioned this practice in his work _Description of Greece_.<sup>1</sup> He described how the Athenians, in their religious zeal, erected altars to gods they might not know by name. In Life of Apollonius of Tyana, Philostratus, a Greek philosopher, referenced the existence of altars to unknown gods as well, further confirming the practice in ancient Greek religious life.<sup>2</sup> According to some traditions, the idea of an altar to an unknown god might be connected to Epimenides, a sixth-century-B.C. philosopher and poet from Crete. He is said to have suggested the Athenians build altars to unknown gods to stop a plague that was afflicting the city. The Greeks acknowledged that there could be divine beings beyond their immediate knowledge.

This altar “To The Unknown God” provided a way for Paul to connect with the Athenians’ religious and philosophical mindset, directing their attention to the God he proclaimed. This allowed Paul to introduce the true God as the Lord of heaven and earth. Paul’s message emphasized God’s greatness and immanence, His role as Creator, and His call for all people to seek and find Him.

Understanding the Athenian background is crucial to appreciating Paul’s method. Athens was home to various schools of thought, including Epicureanism, which taught that the gods were distant and uninvolved in human affairs, and Stoicism, which believed in a divine principle that permeated everything but was not a personal deity. Paul’s declaration of a personal, involved Creator God directly challenged these prevailing views.

Charles Malik, a prominent Lebanese philosopher and Christian thinker, said, “saving the soul and saving the mind” is Christianity’s role in education and culture.<sup>3</sup> Malik asserts that universities were established with theology at their core. Indeed, many of the first Western universities, such as Oxford, Cambridge, and Harvard, began with theology as the central discipline, reflecting their Christian origins. Theology was considered the foundational discipline because it addressed the ultimate questions about God, human existence, and the nature of reality.

This week, we will study Paul’s Mars Hill encounter as a framework for how to effectively communicate Christian philosophy in a pluralistic society. We will explore God’s omnipotence, His relational character, the contending philosophies of the time, and the importance of apologetics, which involves not only defending the faith but also explaining it in a way that resonates with the audience’s cultural and philosophical context. By examining Paul’s approach, we can learn how to address contemporary challenges to faith and present the gospel in a compelling manner.
