In your Sabbath School class (or Bible study group), use the outline of questions below to study this week’s main passage and supporting verses. Consider these discussion questions with the rest of the group.

The problem of suffering:

1. Rather than blaming blindness on past sins or karma, what perspective does Jesus offer on sickness and suffering? _John 9:1–7_
2. Instead of detaching from relationships and emotions, how does Jesus relate to suffering people?
3. How does the Christian response to human suffering compare and contrast with that of other religions?

`Personal reflection: What examples have you seen of Christians bringing light and hope into situations of terrible suffering? What lessons have you learned?`

Spiritual practices:

1. Siddhartha Gautama searched for spiritual enlightenment through meditation and ethical living. What does the Bible say is the source of spiritual enlightenment? _John 1:9; 9:5; 11:10; 12:46_
2. Why does ethical living and self-reliance fail to give us inner peace? _Eph. 2:8, 9; Rom. 3:23_
3. What are some differences between biblical meditation and Eastern meditation? _Ps. 119:15, 23, 27, 48, 78, 97, 99, 148_
4. Is it important to have moments of quietness and solitude? _Ps. 62:5; Mark 1:35_
5. How did Jesus prioritize quiet alone time for prayer? _Matt. 14:23; Luke 5:16_

`Personal reflection: Which approach feels more freeing to you, striving for peace through your own efforts or receiving peace as a gift through faith in Jesus? Why?`

**Key takeaways to remember:**

- Human suffering is not caused by karma. God can use suffering to reveal His glory.
- Only Jesus can give true peace. Our own striving and self-reliance cannot produce it.
- Rather than emptying the mind, biblical meditation fills the mind with God’s promises and goodness.
