`Read about the celebration in Nehemiah 12:31–42. Why is music an important part of it?`

In Nehemiah’s time, the priests, or religious leaders, start two big singing groups. These two groups, or choirs, walk around Jerusalem. They sing praises to God. They thank God for everything He does for them. Some people in the choirs play music while other people sing. Ezra stands at the front of one choir. He leads it through the city. Nehemiah stands at the back of the 2nd choir. He follows the musicians from behind. The two choirs start in the same place. Then they separate. The 1st choir goes around the city walls. The 2nd choir goes around the walls too. But they go in a different direction. The two choirs meet up again at the Valley Gate. Then together they go to the temple. Outside, the priests blow the trumpets. Then the choirs go inside. The two choirs stand in the temple and face each other. 

Let us answer the question at the top of this page: Why is music an important part of the worship in the temple? To answer this question, we must understand worship in the temple. Music in the temple is not a concert! People do not come to the temple only to enjoy the music. Music is a part of worship. As the musicians sing and play, the people pray. The music helps them honor God in the temple.

The animal offerings are the most important part of worship at the temple. The animals are killed. Yes, each animal’s death is sad. But it is a necessary part of the temple worship. The killed animals show the people Jesus’ future death on the cross for their sins. Of course, it must have been hard for the people to watch the animals die. So, the beautiful music helps lift the people’s thoughts to heaven. The music helps make their whole worship experience better. It helps them feel better too. 

`Find examples in the Bible where music is an important part of worship. Look at Exodus 15:1; 2 Chronicles 20:21, 22; and Revelation 15:2–4. What is the singing all about?`

Both on earth and in heaven, music is an important part of worship. In the verses above, the people sing about everything God does for them. That is why they praise Him. 

_The music helps the people honor God in the temple._
