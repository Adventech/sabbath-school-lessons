`Read Nehemiah 13:26, 27. What do these verses show us about why it is important to know Bible history? How can it help us to stay away from danger? How can it also help us to walk on the right road that leads to heaven?`

Nehemiah tells the people to remember what happened to King Solomon. Solomon did not obey God’s law. Solomon married many wives. He also chose to marry women who did not worship God. God’s law warns us: “ ‘The king must not have many wives. If he does, they will lead him astray [away from the Lord]’ ” (Deuteronomy 17:17, NIrV). Solomon made bad choices. His choices led him into more sin. He caused his own ruin. Solomon’s life is an example of what God’s people should not do. 

`Nehemiah tells the Jews that they sinned when they married people who do not worship God. Why is Nehemiah right? For the answers, read Genesis 6:1–4; Genesis 24:3, 4; Genesis 28:1, 2; Deuteronomy 7:3, 4; and 2 Corinthians 6:14.`

Why does God tell His people not to marry non-Jews? Because God does not want His people to start worshiping false gods. Yes, God’s people in the Bible marry non-Israelites. Moses marries Zipporah. She is from Midian. Boaz marries Ruth. She is from Moab. So, God’s command is not against marrying someone from a different country. God’s command is against marrying someone from a different faith. Or no faith at all. That is exactly the problem in Ezra and Nehemiah’s time. The Jews choose to marry women who do not believe in God. These women do not choose to give up their false gods. So, Nehemiah is sad that the Jewish men chose to marry these wives. These men show by their choices that they do not care about serving God.

The Bible gives us rules to follow. These rules help us stay close to God. They cause us to be happy. In the same way, God gives His people, then and now, the rule not to marry people who do not believe in Him. We should only marry people who love Him and share our faith. Then we will lead better lives that will help us grow closer to God.

`What can we learn from today’s study that can help us protect our faith and our families?`
