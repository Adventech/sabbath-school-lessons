**This is Easy Reading Edition of the Sabbath School. For the regular Adult version with Teacher comments and EGW notes please open the top lesson on the main screen** 

The Bible shows us examples of leaders. Some good, some bad. Sometimes a leader can be good for a while and bad later. Bad leaders, at times, do some good things. Good leaders, at times, do bad things. Remember, all leaders are human. They can choose to do good or evil. 

The problem is that leaders have more power than most people to change many lives. So, it is very important that leaders follow Bible truth in their own lives. 

**Look up the verses below. What examples of leaders do these verses show us? Are they good or bad examples? Explain your answers.**

`Rehoboam (1 Kings 12:1–16)`

`Peter (Acts 15:7–11)`

`Josiah (2 Kings 23:1–10)`

`Deborah (Judges 4:1–16)`

`Ahab (1 Kings 21:1–16)`

`These stories are only a few examples of leaders in the Bible. What lessons do you learn from their lives about the things that make a leader good or bad? How can these lessons help us in whatever we do in life?`
