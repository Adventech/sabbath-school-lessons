`What are some ways that you’ve seen people categorized as greater than or less than? What truths do these categorizations miss?`

`How can we overcome ingrained stereotypes or ways of treating people with partiality?`

`Share a time that you were treated unfairly and/or less than. What did you learn from the experience?`

`How can we learn to distrust our judgments of other people and trust God’s view and justice instead?`

`What are a few examples of things God has asked you to do that are relatively easy for you? What are a few that are harder?`

`How can we know if we’re “selectively obeying” Christ?`

`How was Jesus’ ministry countercultural to today’s culture and ways of doing ministry?`
