`How have you experienced “wars and fights” as a result of desires for pleasures?`

`What does it practically mean and look like to desire friendship with the world?`

`How does the world tell you to accomplish and/or gain things? Give some concrete examples. How does God’s Word compare with those instructions? Be specific.`

`How can you pray for things that you want in a biblical, balanced way?`

`Think of a time that mourning was good for you. Describe that experience and what you can learn from it.`

`How does knowing that God “yearns jealously” for you affect your life?`

`How can we want to be friends with God instead of the world and not just look like it?`
