`How can we learn to distrust our own perceptions and trust the way God presents situations?`

`Why is deception required in order for us to fall into sin?`

`Share a situation where you were tested. What happened? How did you respond?`

`How is God currently teaching you to trust Him more? In what areas?`

`Focusing on the inSight section, how are we to respond to others as our perceptions grow in clarity?`

`Is it possible to be content, but still strive for more? Why or why not?`

`How does seeing all good things as a gift alter our everyday life?`
