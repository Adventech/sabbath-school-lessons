`What is a difficult experience you endured and can now see how good came from it? Share.`

`What can be said to those who have not seen any good?`

`How can you ensure that you respond to afflictions in a Christ-like way rather than a worldly way?`

`Why do you think James focused on receiving wisdom in the main passage this week? Why not courage or strength?`

`Why is faith necessary to receive the promises of God?`

`What is the difference between having faith in God’s promises and “supposing” He will give?`

`How does patience “work in us”? Why that attribute specifically?`
