`Share a time that you were meaningfully and positively impacted by someone’s words.`

`Why do you think words affect us so much?`

`How does it affect our relationship with God when we have both “fresh water” and “salty” coming from our mouths?`

`When James says that we should not curse men and bless God at the same time, does this allow for people to grow from immaturity to maturity? Why or why not?`

`How have you seen the way Jesus speaks differently after this week’s study?`

`How can we balance our understanding of the importance of the expressions of our heart and the importance of the condition of our heart itself?`

`How can we have an Ezekiel 36:26 experience?`
