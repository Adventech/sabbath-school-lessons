`When do you pray to God easily, and when is it harder for you? Why?`

`Share an experience of God answering a prayer of yours in a memorable way.`

`Share an experience of how community has helped you in your spiritual walk.`

`What experience have you had with praying for healing? What did you learn from the experience?`

`How have you seen James 5:19, 20 played out in real life?`

`How would you like to enhance your prayer life?`

`What usually prevents us from pouring out our thoughts to God in prayer?`
