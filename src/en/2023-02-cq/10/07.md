`Why is it so critically important to understand the truth about death? What does it protect us from? Why is it so comforting, too?`

`How can we avoid being deceived by the obvious as well as the subtle deceptions of the devil?`

`How do we explain that some who do evil believe they are following the will of God? What role should the law of God play in this explanation?`

`Think through examples of people who have done evil things even though they were acting based on what they believed was right or even what they believed was God’s will. What can we learn from these tragic events?`

`Look around at how prevalent Sunday worship is in Christian churches. What should this fact teach us about how pervasive Satan’s deceptions are? Again, as with the state of the dead, what is our only safeguard?`

`What is God’s appeal to the multitudes still in fallen religious organizations?`

`How are Satan’s final deceptions different from any of his other ones?How are they exactly the same?`

`How do we avoid fanaticism as well as naïveté? Which ditch are you more prone to fall into?`
