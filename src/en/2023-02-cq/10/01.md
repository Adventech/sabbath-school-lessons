**Read This Week’s Passage: Revelation 16:13, 14 and
18:2, 3**

**Poison Control**

It was one of those gorgeous September mornings in Chicago. As the sun rose over Lake Michigan and commuters battled traffic jams on the Kennedy and Eisenhower expressways and children made their way to school, a chilling story began to emerge that struck fear into the hearts of all Chicagoans: people were becoming tragically sick, and some were dying just a few hours after taking Tylenol capsules. Upon testing, each of the capsules proved to be laced with potassium cyanide, a deadly poison. A deranged individual had tampered with the medication. To this day, authorities don’t know who did this.

As we have seen, Revelation warns us that the “inhabitants of the earth” will drink a deadly poison called the “wine” of Babylon. There are false doctrines and teachings that, in the end, will lead only to death. However, the world is not left without the antidote, the protection against this spiritual poison: the three angels’ messages.

In this week’s lesson we will continue to look at Babylon’s deceptions, Jesus’ plan to save us from them, and the death they would otherwise bring.
