**Read This Week’s Passage: Revelation 4:11**

**Taken for Granted**

It’s easy to take things for granted, particularly things we have always known or experienced. How easy, for instance, for young children to take their parents for granted, whom they have known all their short lives? How easy for us, too, to take for granted the sun, the sky, the air, and the ground beneath our feet.

However, have you ever stopped to think just how much we take existence itself for granted? How often do we stop and ask the famous philosophical question “Why is there something instead of nothing?”

Why does our universe and all the majesty and grandeur and astonishing things in it exist to begin with? According to the latest scientific theory (they tend to change), our universe once did not exist. In other words, ours is a contingent existence; it’s a miracle that we are here at all. And despite all sorts of myths about the universe arising from absolutely nothing or from some kind of mathematical equation, our universe exists because God, the Creator, has made it and everything in it.
