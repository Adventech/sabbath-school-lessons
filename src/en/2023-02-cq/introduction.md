### Introduction to Three Cosmic Messages

On October 15, 1844, one week before the Great Disappointment, a boy was born into a pious Lutheran family in Germany. His name was Friedrich Nietzsche, and he would become one of modernity’s most influential atheists. Believing that the Christian God was dying in the West, Nietzsche railed against the Christian religion’s continued moral influence, deriding it as a “slave morality”—the morality of the weak, who, in an attempt to protect themselves from the stronger, concocted silly notions such as “love your enemies.” For Nietzsche, modernity needed to get beyond antiquated notions of “good and evil,” exemplified by a character in one of his books (Thus Spake Zarathustra) who declared, “Smash the old law tablets!” (meaning, of course, the Ten Commandments).

The year 1844 was also important for Karl Marx, the founder of communism. That year, Marx wrote a work called the “Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844,” published posthumously by the Soviet Union in 1932. The manuscripts show the early development of Marx’s ideology in which he argued for a totally materialist reality that moved through various economic stages until the workers of the world united, overthrew their capitalist oppressors, and created a utopia on earth.

The year 1844 was an important one for Charles Darwin, too. In what has become known as the “Essay of 1844,” Darwin produced one of the earliest expressions of his evolutionary theory, even if it was not then made public. Only in 1859, with the publication of the book On the Origin of Species, did Darwin publicly promulgate his view that all life on earth originated from a common ancestor by natural and chance processes alone.

The year 1844 was also, however, the fulfillment of the 2,300-day prophecy of Daniel 8:14 and the same year that, out of the leftovers of the Great Disappointment, seeds were planted that would burgeon in a worldwide movement whose core message repudiates the core of Nietzschean, Marxist, and Darwinian ideology.

Contrary to Nietzsche, the Seventh-day Adventist movement proclaimed that not only does God exist, but His universal code of morality (the “Old Law tablets”), the Ten Commandments, remains His ultimate standard of judgment and binding over all humanity.

Contrary to Marx, the Seventh-day Adventist movement proclaimed that the great controversy between Christ and Satan, not a materialist flow of history, explained both our world’s history up to that point and how our history will end in the future: not in a human-made communist utopia, but in the supernatural establishment of God’s eternal kingdom.

And contrary to Darwin, the Seventh-day Adventist movement taught that life originated not in the natural and chance process of random mutation and natural selection, but by the power of the Creator God, who in six days created life on earth and rested on the seventh.

Could it be a coincidence that all these events happened in 1844? One should not think so.

Nietzsche, Marx, Darwin—three influential figures whose work has caused humanity irreparable harm. But amid all these errors, God did not leave the world without a witness to His truth, which is why, among these destructive ideologies, He raised up a movement that would, over time, morph into the Seventh-day Adventist Church and that would proclaim His last-day truth to the world: the three angels’ messages. These messages refute the errors and misconceptions promoted by those three terribly deceived men.

In a sense, the three angels’ messages are the marching orders of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. At their core, they are the gospel, pure and simple, but the gospel declared in the context of “present truth” (2 Pet. 1:12). And this, the three angels’ messages, is our study for the quarter.
