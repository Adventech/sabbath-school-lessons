  title: "Three Cosmic Messages"
  description: "On October 15, 1844, one week before the Great Disappointment, a boy was born into a pious Lutheran family in Germany. His name was Friedrich Nietzsche, and he would become one of modernity’s most influential atheists. Believing that the Christian God was dying in the West, Nietzsche railed against the Christian religion’s continued moral influence, deriding it as a “slave morality”—the morality of the weak, who, in an attempt to protect themselves from the stronger, concocted silly notions such as “love your enemies.” For Nietzsche, modernity needed to get beyond antiquated notions of “good and evil,” exemplified by a character in one of his books (Thus Spake Zarathustra) who declared, “Smash the old law tablets!” (meaning, of course, the Ten Commandments)."
