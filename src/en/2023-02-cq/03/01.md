**Read This Week’s Passage: Revelation 14:6**

**Our Identifying Statement of Faith**

Israel’s clear, identifiable, and powerful statement of faith, found in Deuteronomy 6:4, set them firmly apart from the polytheistic heathens around them: “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.”

Throughout the centuries the chanting of the Shema, which is the name of the prayer in Deuteronomy 6 (based on the Hebrew word for “hear”), reminded the Jews of the spiritual vision that united them as a people and strengthened their resolve to maintain their unique identity as worshipers of the one true God.

For Seventh-day Adventists the three angels’ messages in Revelation 14 are our Shema. They are our identifying statement of faith. They define who we are as a people and describe our mission to the world. In short, our unique prophetic identity is outlined in Revelation 14:6–12, and it is here that we find our passion to proclaim the gospel to the world.

In this week’s lesson we will begin a detailed study of Revelation 14:6–12 through the eyes of grace as we listen to God speaking to our hearts.
