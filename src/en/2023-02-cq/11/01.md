**Read This Week’s Passage: Revelation 13**

**The Greatest Force**

As we study end-time events related to the mark of the beast, one crucial point that comes through is the difference between how God operates and how the enemy does.

As we have been studying, the central issues in the great controversy between Christ and Satan focus on authority, loyalty, and worship. The prophecies describing the beast in Revelation 13, the little horn in Daniel 7, and the “son of perdition” in 2 Thessalonians 2 all speak of a power that usurps God’s authority, commands loyalty, and introduces a counterfeit system of worship. They do so using force, coercion, and at times bribes and rewards—all to control worship.

In contrast, love is the great motivating force of the kingdom of God. Rather than worshiping the beast, God’s people find their greatest joy and highest delight in worshiping Him. They are committed to Him because they know how committed He is to them. There is only one thing that will keep any of us from receiving the mark of the beast in the end-time: a love for Jesus so deep that nothing can break our hold upon Him.

In this lesson we will explore these themes further.
