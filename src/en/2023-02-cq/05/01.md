**Read This Week’s Passage: Deuteronomy Daniel 7**

**Looking Forward to Judgment**

If the Bible is ever clear about anything, it’s clear on the fact that God is a God of judgment and that sooner or later, in one way or another, the judgment so lacking here and now is going to come and be administered by God Himself, “the Judge of all the earth” (Gen. 18:25; see also Ps. 58:11; 94:2; 98:9). As Paul himself wrote: “So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God” (Rom. 14:12).

Scary thought, isn’t it? Having to give an account of ourselves before the God who knows the deepest things, the God who will “bring every work into judgment, including every secret thing, whether good or evil” (Eccles. 12:14).

Yet the judgment ultimately reveals the goodness and grace of God and that He is both just and merciful in how He deals with both the saved and the lost.

This week we will explore the deeper themes of the judgment in relation to the great controversy raging in the universe, and we will look especially at what happens when God’s faithful people face the inevitable “judgment to come” (Acts 24:25).
