`Why is the idea of fallen humans being able to add anything to what Christ did on the cross such a heretical idea?`

`How does the Sabbath commandment reveal the link between Creation and Redemption?`

`How is the Sabbath commandment hinted at in Revelation 14:6, 7, and why is it important to our end-time message?`

`How does our understanding of Creation influence our behavior?`

`What relationship do heredity and environment have with the daily choices we make?`

`How can we, by God’s grace, overcome character defects that we didn’t choose to have?`

`How does the message of the Sabbath answer the great questions of life, such as where we came from, why we’re here, and what our eternal destiny is?`

`Without exception, the prime memorial of the Creation, the Sabbath, comes to us (as opposed to us going to it) every week. What should that tell us about how important the doctrine of Creation is?`

`How do we show someone who believes in millions or even billions of years of evolution as the means of creation the irrationality of keeping the seventh-day Sabbath as a memorial to that creation?`
