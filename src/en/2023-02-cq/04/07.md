`How do we balance the gravity of last-day events with the necessity to live life abundantly?`

`What has your own experience of fearing God been?`

`What hinders us today from encountering the real Jesus Christ of Scripture?`

`Think about the incredible power of the One who created and sustains the entire cosmos. Think about how much greater and more powerful He is than we are. How do these facts help us understand the idea of the “fear of God” and what it means?`

`How can we avoid legalism when we discuss the biblical concepts of holiness, overcoming, and victory?`

`Why must we understand that it was Christ’s victory for us at the cross that alone remains the foundation of our hope of salvation, regardless of our victories (or even failures) here and now?`

`With all the promises of victory over sin, why do we often find ourselves failing to live up to the standard Jesus modeled for us and promised could be our experience as well?`

`What mistakes are we making that don’t allow Christ to do His work? What does that look like in everyday life?`

`How can we translate our spiritual desires into action?`

`What practical steps can we take to be one of Revelation’s “overcomers”?`
