**Read This Week’s Passage: Revelation 14:7, 12**

**Applauding the Apocalypse**

Danish author Søren Kierkegaard once told a parable about the end-time that went something like this: A fire broke out backstage in a big theater. A clown, who had been part of the performance, came out to warn the audience: Get out; the place is on fire! The audience thought it was just a big joke, part of the show, that’s all, and just applauded. He repeated the warning: Get out! Get out! But the more emphatically he warned them, the greater the applause. For Kierkegaard, that was how the world is going to end: to the general applause of people who believe it’s a joke.

The end of the world and the events leading up to it are, as we know, no joke. The world faces the most serious crisis since the Flood. In fact, Peter himself uses the story of the Flood as a symbol of the end, warning that just as the world of old perished by water, in the end-times, “the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat; both the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up” (2 Pet. 3:10). Having been warned about what is coming, we must be prepared for it.
