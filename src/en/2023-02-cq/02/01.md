**Read This Week’s Passage: Revelation 14:14–20**

**A Message of Destiny**

God has always spoken to His people, giving them whatever relevant truths they need to hear at the time. From the warning about the Flood (Gen. 6:7) to the first coming of Jesus (Dan. 9:24–27) to the pre-Advent judgment (Dan. 7:9, 10; 8:14) to final events before Christ’s return (Revelation 12–14), God has spoken to us many times throughout history. In these last days of humanity He has sent a special message to the world and to His people, designed to meet the need of the hour. In Revelation He depicts this message as being carried by three angels flying in midheaven with their urgent, end-time message to all the world.

The three angels’ message is Jesus’ final message of mercy, a call that leads us from trusting in our own righteousness to trusting Jesus’ righteousness to justify, sanctify, and, at the end of time, glorify us.

As always, though, we must choose Christ, choose to surrender to Him and to obey Him, and the choices we make now will indeed impact the choices we make in the final crisis ahead of us. Now is the time to prepare.
