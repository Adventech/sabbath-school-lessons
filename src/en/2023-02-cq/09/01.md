**Read This Week’s Passage: Revelation 17**

**Of Suns and Scarlet**

The great controversy theme is summarized in Revelation using the symbolism of two women, one clothed with the sun (Rev. 12) and one dressed in scarlet (Rev. 17).

The striking symbol of the woman clothed with the sun, the dazzling glory of Christ, is found in Revelation 12. She is faithful to Jesus. She is not defiled by the corruption of false doctrines. Throughout the Bible a pure woman symbolizes the bride of Jesus, or the true church. In Jeremiah 6:2 the prophet says, “I have likened the daughter of Zion to a lovely and delicate woman.” The prophet uses the expression “daughter of Zion,” meaning a faithful woman, to describe God’s people (see also Eph. 5:25–32 and Hos. 2:20).

In contrast, the Bible likens apostasy to harlotry or adultery (James 4:4). Speaking of Israel’s rebellion and unfaithfulness, Ezekiel laments, “You are an adulterous wife, who takes strangers instead of her husband” (Ezek. 16:32).

In this week’s lesson we will study these two women of Revelation and probe deeper into the conflict between truth and error.
