`Why is Revelation 12 a fitting introduction to the three angels’ messages, especially in view of the coming conflict at the time of the end?`

`How is Revelation 12 reassuring to you personally in the daily temptations and trials you face?`

`There are some who believe our actions are determined largely by our heredity and environment. Do you agree or disagree? What role does our choice have in determining our behavior? Discuss the relationship between our choice and God’s power as He operates in our lives.`

`Think about how sacred free will and free choice must be to Jesus, who, though knowing it would lead Him to the cross (see 2 Tim. 1:9), gave us free will anyway. What should this tell us about how carefully we should use this sacred-but-costly gift?`

`Read Revelation 12:11. What assurance of victory does Christ give us in this passage?`

`Describe a time of trial or difficulty in your life when you could have easily become discouraged, but God provided a place of refuge for you and nourished you in your challenges. How did God provide support when you most needed it?`

`Read Revelation 12:17. What characteristics of God’s remnant, His last-day church, are found in this verse?`

`There are some who think our love for our parents, our children, our spouses is nothing but an arrangement of atoms. What do you think? Is there more to it than that?`

`How can what Paul wrote in Philippians 3:9 be our own experience?`
