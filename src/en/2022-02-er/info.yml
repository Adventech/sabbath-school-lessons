  title: "Genesis"
  description: "Genesis is about Jesus. Jesus made us. Jesus keeps us alive. Jesus is also our Savior. Moses wrote the book of Genesis. Thousands of years after Moses, John shows us Jesus as the One who made us, too: “The Word (Christ [Jesus]) was in the beginning. The Word was with God. The Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. He made all things. Nothing was made without Him making it. Life began by Him. His Life was the Light for men” (John 1:1–4, NLV)."
