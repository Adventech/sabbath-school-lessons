> “ ‘Then the man said, “Your name will not be Jacob. Your name will now be Israel. I give you this name because you have fought with God and with men, and you have won’ ” (Genesis 32:28, ERV).

THE STORY OF JACOB continues. Jacob now leaves Laban and is on his way home. Soon Jacob will come face-to-face with Esau. Jacob did an awful wrong to his brother in the past. What will Esau do to Jacob now, after all these years?

For sure, Jacob is afraid about what may happen. So, the Lord God of Abraham and Isaac comes again to Jacob to give him courage and hope. This meeting will become known later as the “time of trouble for the people of Jacob” (read Jeremiah 30:7, ERV; read also verses 5–7). That night, Jacob the cheat becomes “Israel.” This new name shows us a new beginning in life for Jacob. This new beginning will lead to the start of a new people group, who will be named after Israel.

The story of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob shows us that we can depend on God to do everything He promises. God will keep His promises even when His people, at times, work against him or fail to obey His csommands.
