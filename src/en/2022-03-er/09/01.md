> “Always be filled with joy in the Lord. I will say it again. Be filled with joy” (Philippians 4:4, ERV).

WE CAN PRAISE the Lord when we feel joy. We have a hard time praising God when things are bad, right? But that’s when we need to praise God the most. Praise helps us keep our faith strong.

Praise can change the worst experiences in our lives. Maybe we are hurting or suffering when we praise God. But our praising God can change us and change the people around us. Praise can help us not to feel so bad when we suffer, too.

We show our faith when we praise God. Praising God when we are sad or worried may not be easy to do. But we must praise God in hard times. We must make praise a part of our lives. Praising God has the power to change us and to help us win our fight against sin and suffering.
