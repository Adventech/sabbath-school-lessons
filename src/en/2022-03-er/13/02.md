The Bible gives us little information about Jesus’ childhood. But a few verses do tell us something about how things were when He came to this earth as one of us.

`Read Luke 2:7, 22–24 (read also Leviticus 12:6–8) and Matthew 2:1–18. What do these verses show us about Jesus’ life as a young child? Was His life easy or hard?`

Jesus was born poor. People wanted to kill Jesus even when He was a baby. The Bible helps us understand the troubles that Jesus had from an early age.

`Read John 1:46. How does this verse help us understand more about the troubles that the young Jesus suffered?`

Jesus is the only Person who lived on this earth who never sinned. But He lived with sinners. Jesus must have suffered deeply as a child. He was perfect. So, the sin all around Him must have bothered Him very much. We are far from perfect. We are sinners, for sure. At the same time, there are some sins that we will not ever do. We don’t even want to hear about anyone who does them. When we do, we feel sad and upset. Can you think about how Jesus felt when He saw sin? He must have felt a lot of pain, for sure.

`Ask: “Do the sins all around me bother me? Or don’t I care?” If you’re not bothered by sin, can it be because of the things you read, watch, or do? Think about it.`
