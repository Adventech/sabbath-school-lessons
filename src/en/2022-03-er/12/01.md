> “ ‘For sure, I tell you, unless a seed falls into the ground and dies, it will only be a seed. If it dies, it will give much grain [food crop]’ ” (John 12:24, NLV).

JESUS GIVES US A WORD PICTURE about a wheat seed that dies. The dying wheat seed shows us what it means to give our lives fully to God. First, the wheat seed falls from the wheat plant. The seed has no control over where it falls or how it falls to the ground. The seed also has no control over the ground that covers it.

Second, the seed waits to grow. The wheat seed lies in the earth. But the seed doesn’t know what will happen in the future. (It is only a seed of wheat, and of course, a seed can’t think!)

Third, the seed dies. The seed must die to become a wheat plant. The seed gives up its safe place in the earth as a seed. The seed must “die.” That is, the seed must give up the past to become something new. Then the seed may change into a plant that makes more food for us to eat.
