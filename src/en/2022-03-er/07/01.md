> “We will not be disappointed by this hope. God has given us the Holy Spirit. And the Holy Spirit has put God’s love in our hearts” (Romans 5:5, WE).

WHEN WE ARE AROUND SMILING PEOPLE at church, we feel that talking and singing about hope is easy. But when we suffer, then singing and talking aren’t so easy, right? As things get bad, we start to question everything, including God’s wisdom.

In one of his books, C. S. Lewis writes about a make-believe lion. Someone who wants to meet the lion asks another person if the lion is safe. The person says that the lion is not safe, “but he’s good.”

We don’t always understand God. Often, He does things that confuse us or that we don’t expect. But these things don’t mean that God is against us. We just don’t have the full picture yet. Often, we have the false idea that we can’t have peace or hope if we can’t understand God and everything He’s going to do. We want God to be “safe.” This wish causes us to be disappointed or to lose hope.
