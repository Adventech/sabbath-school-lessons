  title: "The Suffering Savior"
  description: "The Bible tells us that Jesus made everything: “God made everything by the Word [Jesus]. Nothing has been made without him” (John 1:3, WE). At the same time, the Bible also tells us that the One who made everything also is the One who “cried” (John 11:35) when His friend Lazarus died. Jesus cried? Yes. What is more, “people looked down on him. They didn’t accept him. He knew all about pain and suffering. He was like [the same as] someone people turn their faces away from” (Isaiah 53:3, NIrV). Jesus was hated and rejected? Yes. When Jesus died, He cried, “ ‘My God, my God, why have you left me alone?’ ” (Matthew 27:46, ERV)."
