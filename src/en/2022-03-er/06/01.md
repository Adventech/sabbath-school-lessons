> “I work hard with all the strength of Christ. His strength works powerfully in me” (Colossians 1:29, NIrV).

TWO PEOPLE WERE INVITED to be guests on a talk show. One of the guests was a man. The other guest was a woman. Each one of them had a child who had been killed. 20 years before, the woman’s son was killed. The woman continued to feel angry at her son’s killer after all these years. The man had a daughter who was killed only a few years earlier. But the man was not angry at his daughter’s killers. The man said that he forgave the killers. The man also said that God changed his hurt into a blessing. Yes, the man’s pain was terrible. But the man became an example of how God can bring healing to the worst times in our lives.

How can two people who had the same experience act in different ways? How does spiritual change happen in the life of a Christian? How does spiritual change help a person grow stronger during tests so that he or she is not destroyed by them?
