### Outline #11 Sharing the Story of Jesus

*  Jesus: the Center of your personal testimony
	* Every Christian testimony should include three important parts: your life before you met Jesus, how you met Jesus, and your life after you accepted Jesus as Savior and Lord.
	* How does Paul describe the lives of Christians in Ephesus before they met Jesus? Ephesians 2:1-3
	* How did these Christians in Ephesus hear the story of Jesus? Acts 19:1a, 8-10, Ephesians 2:4-9
	* How were the lives of these citizens of Ephesus changed after they heard the truth about Jesus and accepted Him as their Savior and Lord? Acts 19:18-20, Ephesians 1:15-16, 2:10
	* What is your personal testimony—life before Jesus, how you met Jesus, and your life after you accepted Jesus as your personal Savior and Lord?

*  The powerful witness of a transformed life
	* Is transformation immediate or it is a process?
	* Acts 9:1-22 Describe Saul’s transformation.
	* Mark 5:1-20 Describe the transformation of the demoniac on the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee.
	* What do these two transformations (Saul and the demoniac) have in common?
	* 2 Peter 3:17-18, Philippians 3:10-12 What important lesson can we learn from the testimony of Peter and Paul?
	* Describe the behavior of James and John early in their relationship with Jesus. Luke 9:51-56, Mark 10:35-37
	* What remarkable change is evident in the life of the apostle John as a result of his growing relationship with Jesus? 1 John 3:1, 1 John 4:7-11
	* Let’s go back to our earlier question: Is transformation immediate or is it a process?
		* A transformed life can be clearly seen even when no words are spoken.  Who is a powerful example to you of a transformed life?

*  Testifying about Jesus with confidence
	* 1 John 1:1-4, 1 John 5:11-13
	* 2 Timothy 1:3-12
	* Hebrews 10:19-23
	* Jesus lived, died, rose again, and ascended to heaven almost 2,000 years ago.  How can we testify with confidence about Jesus even though we have never met Him in person? (Galatians 2:20)
	* When did you come to the blessed assurance that Jesus was not only Savior of the world but also your personal Savior? How did that realization impact your testimony about Jesus to others?
