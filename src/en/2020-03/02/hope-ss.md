*  Unlikely witnesses
	* Mark 5:1-5, 6-13, 14-17, 18-20 (see also Luke 8:38-39). Why did Jesus send this former demoniac back to his people rather than allowing him to join the band of disciples who traveled with Jesus?
	* How did the personal testimony of this former demoniac impact those who heard his story?
	* Name some other unlikely witnesses whose stories are recorded in the New Testament.
	* Share a time when you heard a remarkable testimony from an unlikely witness.

*  Proclaiming the Risen Christ
	* Mark 16:9-11 (see also John 20:11-18) What was Mary Magdalene’s reaction after she encountered Jesus risen from the dead?
	* What important lesson can we learn from Peter and John when instructed by the Sanhedrin to stop sharing their testimony about Jesus? Acts 5:26-29
	* Share a time when you felt compelled to give your testimony about Jesus, even when some didn’t want to listen or actively opposed you.
	* What is an appropriate response when someone tells you, “I don’t want to hear your testimony about Jesus”?

*  The testimony of a transformed life
	* Acts 4:5-13 Why was the testimony about Jesus given by Peter and John so compelling?

	* What elements of Paul story, recorded in Acts 9:1-25, are omitted in his testimony before Herod Agrippa? Why?
	* How is the apostle John’s testimony different from that of the apostle Paul? What do they have in common? 1 John 1:1-4
	* Share a testimony of a transformed life that made a profound impression on you.

*  Sharing your personal testimony
	* What key elements should be included every time we share our testimony as a follower of Jesus?
	* Think of a time when you shared your testimony, either with an individual or a group.  How did this experience impact your life?  How did your testimony impact your hearers?
	* Who would be willing to share a testimony today of how knowing Jesus has impacted your life?
	* How has your attitude about sharing your testimony changed as a result of this study?
