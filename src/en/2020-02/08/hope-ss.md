### Outline #8 Creation: Genesis as Foundation – Part 1

*  In the Beginning
	* Genesis 1:1 What important questions are answered in the first sentence of the Bible?
	* What other portions of Scripture make the same bold assertion? John 1:1-3, Hebrew 1:1-2, etc.
	* What difference does it make to know that we are created by God rather than here by chance?

*  The Days of Creation
	* Genesis 1:3-5 According to the inspired account of Genesis, are the days of creation literal days?
	* How does the information contained in the 4th commandment reaffirm the literal days of creation week? Exodus 20:8
	* How should we relate to atheistic or anti-theistic evolutionists who see no place for a Creator God in the origin of life on planet earth?

*  The Sabbath and Creation
	* Genesis 2:1-3 How did the Creator expect those created in His image to relate to this blessed day?
	* Exodus 20:8-11 Why did our Creator command us to remember the Sabbath day? (see also Ezekiel 20:12)
	* How did Jesus reinforce the Bible teaching regarding the Sabbath day? Luke 4:16, Mark 2:27, Matthew 12:11-12
	* Why is the Sabbath an important part of the end-time message to the world? Revelation 14:7

	* How does the instruction in the 5th commandment reinforce God’s plan for the human family? Exodus 20:12
	* How did Jesus affirm the teaching of Scripture regarding God’s plan for marriage? Matthew 19:3-6
	* How should we relate to people who view traditional marriage as an out-of-date tradition that limits personal freedom?

*  Creation, the Entrance of Sin, and God’s Salvation Plan
	* Genesis 1:31 God’s creative work is described as “very good”. What question remains unanswered in this opening portion of Genesis?
	* Genesis 2:15-17 Why would such instruction from God be necessary in a perfect environment? (see Revelation 12:7-12)
	* Genesis 3:1-8, 9-21 What happened when Adam and Eve disregarded the instructions of their Creator?
	* What message of hope is found in this narrative?
