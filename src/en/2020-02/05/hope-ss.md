### Outline #5  Sola Scriptura— the Bible Alone

*  The Bible as the ultimate authority for faith and practice
	* Why was the principle of Sola Scriptura so important for the Protestant reformers? (“Scripture alone is the true lord and master of all writings and doctrine on earth.” Martin Luther)
	* John 17:17 – the testimony of Jesus
	* 2 Peter 1:19-21 – the testimony of Peter
	* Acts 17:10-11 – the example of the Berean Christians, testing Paul’s teaching by the Scriptures

*  The Unity of the Bible
	* Jesus and the apostles viewed the Bible as a whole.
	* Romans 3:10-18 How many portions of the Hebrew Scriptures does Paul reference in this portion of his letter to Christians in Rome?
	* 2 Peter 3:1-16 What can we learn from Peter about his view of the Bible as an inspired whole?
	* 2 Timothy 3:16-17 How does this testimony of Paul to Timothy imply the unity of all portions of the Bible?
	* What should we do when we come across Bible texts or ideas that appear to contradict each other?

*  The Clarity of Scripture
	* Matthew 21:42, 12:3,5, 19:4, 22:31, 24:15
	* Mark 12:10, 13:14
	* Luke 6:3-4
	* While we may not comprehend every thought expressed in the Bible, why is it important to realize that a clear message is evident in the Word of God?
	* Share a time when you struggled to understand a passage of Scripture and finally came to a clearer comprehension of the truth expressed in the text.

*  Scripture interprets Scripture
	* Luke 24:27,44,45
	* Romans 15:4
	* Example: Mark 9:2, Romans 12:2, 2 Corinthians 3:18
	* Example: Ecclesiastes 12:7, 9:5, Genesis 2:7
	* Why is it important to ask, “What other light does the Bible shed on this topic?”

*  Sola Scriptura and non-canonical prophets
	* Name some true prophets of God who did not make any written contributions to the Bible.
	* How should we relate to new discoveries of documents that claim to be written by non-canonical prophets of God? (The Gospel of Thomas, etc.) Isaiah 8:20
	* Seventh-day Adventists accept Ellen G. White as a genuine prophet of God. How did she view her writings in relation to the Bible? Why is it always appropriate to test her writings by the Bible?
