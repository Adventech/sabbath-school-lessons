### Outline #4 The Bible—the authoritative source of our theology

*  Danger #1: Exalting religious tradition over the Bible
	* All Christian churches accept the Bible to some degree.  Unfortunately, some pick and choose what to believe and follow.  Others accept church tradition over the authority of the Bible.
	* Mark 7:1-13 How did Jesus react to those who placed human traditions above the Word of God?
	* Not all religious traditions are bad. Notice Paul’s counsel to Christians in Corinth and Thessalonica:  1 Corinthians 11:2, 2 Thessalonians 3:6
	* What traditions in your church are meaningful and in harmony with the Word of God?
	* How can we discern when we need to let go of long-held religious traditions?

*  Danger #2: Trusting too much in our own experience
	* Sometimes our personal experience can be helpful on our spiritual journey. Romans 2:4, Titus 3:4-5
	* Share a time when the Holy Spirit used a personal experience to draw you closer to Jesus.
	* What warnings do we find in the Bible about trusting in our human experience over the Word of God?  Genesis 3:6 (see Genesis 2:16-17), Judges 14:1-3, 2 Corinthians 11:3, etc.

*  Danger #3: Being influenced negatively by our culture
	* What are some positive aspects of your culture?
	* What does the apostle John mean when he says, “Do not love the world or the things in the world”? 1 John 2:15
	* What aspects of your culture are in complete opposition to the Word of God?
	* How can we live in this sin-damaged world and yet avoid a worldly mindset? 1 John 2:16-17, Philippians 4:8, Psalm 16:8, Hebrews 12:1-2

*  Danger #4: Depending solely on human reason
	* Proverbs 14:12
	* Romans 1:18-23
	* How can we avoid an unhealthy dependence on human reason? 2 Corinthians 10:3-5, Proverbs 9:10
	* How would you respond to a friend who says, “Believing in miracles like those recorded in the Bible is unreasonable”?

*  Safe source for our theology and practice: The Bible
	* Psalm 19:7-11
	* 2 Peter 1:19-21
	* John 5:39, 46-47
	* 2 Timothy 3:15-17
	* How should we respond to a person who comes with a spiritual revelation that is out of harmony with the Bible? Isaiah 8:20, 1 John 5:14-15 (pray)
