### Outline #9 Creation: Genesis as Foundation – Part 2

*  An antiquated unscientific cosmology?
	* Revelation 7:1, 20:7-8 Some suggest these portions of Scripture teach a flat earth, a view that is clearly unscientific.  How would you respond?
	* Who was Job and what truth was revealed to him by the Creator? Job 1:1, 26:7-10
	* What revelation was given to the prophet Isaiah regarding the created cosmos? Isaiah 40:21-22, 26

*  A borrowed creation account?
	* Some suggest the Genesis account of creation was borrowed from or dependent on other ancient Near East accounts.
	* Genesis 1:1-4.  How does the Genesis creation account differ from other non-biblical stories?
	* What other plausible explanation can we give for certain parallels between the Genesis account of creation and other non-biblical creation accounts?
	* How does the wording of Genesis 1:14-19 correct erroneous pagan views regarding creation?
	* What unique perspective on the creation of our first parents is provided in the inspired biblical account? Genesis 2:7, 18-24
	* No non-biblical creation account includes the creation of the Sabbath as a blessed time set apart to fellowship with our Creator.  Why is the Sabbath such an important part of the biblical account of creation?

*  An accurate chronology?
	* Genesis 5:1-20, 21-24, 25-32 Why do you think Moses was inspired to include this genealogy from Adam to Noah in the Book of Genesis?
	* What questions do you have after hearing this genealogy from Adam to Noah?
	* What else do we know from Scripture about Enoch besides the fascinating description found in Genesis 5:21-24? Hebrews 11:5, Jude 14-15

*  Affirmation of Biblical Creation account
	* By Jesus – Matthew 19:4-5, Matthew 24:37-39
	* By the early Christians
		* Peter – 1 Peter 3:20
		* James – James 3:9
		* Paul – Acts 14:15, Romans 1:20, 2 Corinthians 4:6, Ephesians 3:9
	* When did you become convicted that the first chapters of the Bible are a reliable account of the origin of life and early history on earth?
	* How would you respond to a friend who says, “How can so many of my teachers be mistaken regarding the origin of life on this planet?
