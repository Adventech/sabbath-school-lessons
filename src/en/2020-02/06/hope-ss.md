### Outline #6 Why is Interpretation Needed?

*  Presuppositions
	* Luke 24:36-45 What hindered the disciples from seeing the true meaning of the passages in the Hebrew Scriptures referring to the Messiah?
	* Our presuppositions can cloud our thinking.  For example, if a person rejects the possibility of any supernatural invention, what portions of Scripture would be set aside as unreasonable?
	* What are some other presuppositions that are common today when people read the Bible?
	* What promises in the Bible give us hope that we can go beyond any faulty presuppositions and receive a clear word from God? John 16:13, Psalm 32:8, etc.

*  Translation as interpretation
	* What languages were used in the original texts of the Bible?
	* Since most of us do not read ancient Hebrew, Aramaic, or Koine Greek, how can we be sure we have a reliable translation of the text?
	* Psalm 131:1-2 (different translations) Why is the translation different? How can we be certain which translation is correct?
	* What Bible translations have you found helpful in your study of the Bible?

*  The Bible and Culture
	* Acts 17:16-32 What is the cultural context here?
	* Ephesians 6:5-9 Why is it important to understand the cultural context in which the Scriptures were written? (in contrast see Philemon 10-16)
	* How can we better understand biblical times and culture?
	* What universal principles of truth transcend all cultures?

*  Our fallen and sinful nature
	* John 12:42-43 What hindered many religious leaders during the earthly ministry of Jesus from accepting the truths He taught and lived?
	* Psalm 32:8-9 What appeal does the LORD make through the Psalmist David?
	* How is it possible for sinful humans to receive the Word of God with an open and receptive heart?

*  Why interpretation is important (hermeneutics)
	* 2 Peter 3:15-16
	* Nehemiah 8:1-3, 8
	* John 1:41, 9:7
	* Luke 24:27
	* Who has helped you understand the Bible?
	* Consider Revelation 12:7-12. What interpretation is needed to understand this passage?
