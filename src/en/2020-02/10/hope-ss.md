### Outline #10 The Bible as History

*  King David
	* Some would like to rewrite biblical history and claim David, King of Israel, never existed.  However, 12 chapters of 1 Samuel, all of 2 Samuel, and many psalms record the early life, reign, and inspired testimony of David as King of Israel. (2 Sam. 23:2).
	* 1 Samuel 16:1-13 – young David is anointed
	* 1 Samuel 17:41-47 – David confronts Goliath
	* 2 Samuel 11:1-5, 12:1-10 – David’s massive moral failure and the LORD’s rebuke through Nathan.
	* In spite of his failures, why did the LORD call David “a man after my own heart? (Acts 13:22) 2 Samuel 12:13, Psalm 51:1-4,10-13
	* How would biblical history be different if David never existed?

*  Isaiah, King Hezekiah, and Sennacherib
	* Isaiah 36:1-20 Sennacherib’s arrogant threat (archeological evidence of his many conquests)
	* King Hezekiah’s response – Isaiah 37:15-20
	* The LORD’s deliverance – Isaiah 37:33-36
	* Sennacherib’s end – Isaiah 37:37-38
	* What important lessons can we learn from this historical account for our lives today?

*  Daniel, King Nebuchadnezzar, and Babylon
	* Summarize Daniel 1. How do Daniel’s early decisions to honor God impact his own destiny and bless the lives of future generations? (Daniel 1:8)
	* Share a time when you purposed in your heart to honor God rather than follow the ungodly crowd.
	* Prophecies in Daniel 2, and 7-12 clearly outline the history of this world until the glorious climax of earth’s history (Daniel 2:44, 12:1-3).  How can we have confidence that each prophecy will be fulfilled in every detail?
	* How is your life impacted by the revelation that the Most High rules over history? Daniel 4:17

*  The Historical Jesus
	* The Gospels recount the life, death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus.  What evidence in the Gospels point to the historicity of these accounts?
	* What story in the life and ministry of Jesus has impacted you the most?

*  Faith and History
	* Hebrews 11 recounts a brief history of God’s people living “by faith” down through the ages. Why is faith in God always an essential part of our journey toward the Kingdom of Heaven? Hebrews 11:4-6
	* Share a time when you learned the importance of living by faith and not by sight.
