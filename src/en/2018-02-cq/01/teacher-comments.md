### The Cosmic Controversy 
 
#### Surveying the Source 

Isa. 14:12–14; Rom. 8:35–39; Heb. 12:2; Rev. 7:1–7; 12:17 

#### Plotting the Course

The students will: 

- Look at the subject of the end-time with hope, not fear.  
- Allow the hope they have to inform their view of the seeming chaos of the present world. 
- Put Christ and His work on our behalf at the center of their end-time beliefs. 

#### Preparing to Lead 

What we call the Great Controversy started with a disagreement between the God who created everything and one of His creatures. Perhaps that is why it is difficult for us to see how the opposing view had merit.  

God knew why Lucifer was wrong, what would happen as a result, and how it would all end. Yet He still chose to allow events to run their course. We do not fully understand why, but we can know that God has not left us with no hope or agency. He has given us the opportunity to witness His mighty works, and choose Him of our own free will. 

#### Getting Started 

A. Ask your students to describe how they picture themselves in the end times. Are they excited? Are they fearful? Do they regret the things they might not get to do as adults if the world ends “too soon?” To what extent might all of these perceptions, anticipations, and apprehensions be based upon our own limited human comprehension of the situation? Emphasize that love is the motivating factor for God’s actions in these coming events, and that we must focus on our own love for God in order to correctly understand the end times and related issues at a deeper level.  

B. Ask the class: How was the topic of the “end times” presented to them as children if they grew up in the church? Do they feel that this presentation enabled them to grow in their understanding as they got older and more mature? How has their understanding grown or changed over time? What emphases would help their understanding to improve further? 

#### Delving Into the Word 

A. Often, we are told to prepare ourselves for Jesus’ Second Coming. What does the Bible tell us about being prepared for this event? Pass out the Re-producible Activity and have the students look up the passages and succinctly para-phrase each one. This can be done individually with discussion later, or it can be a group discussion/activity. 
 
Emphasize preparation for the Second Coming as a way of life. Make clear that living in the light of the Second Coming is basically to live a good life. It is not to be confused with survivalism or “prepping.” It is about being ready to meet Jesus.  
      
B. The Second Coming is referred to as “the Blessed Hope.” This is important, because we live in a world where many people have lost hope, or perhaps have never had it. As Christians, we can be confident that good things await us. Ask the class to look up the passages in the Reproducible Activity about the future that awaits the people of God in the world to come. What can we say with reasonable certainty about the world after Christ’s return?  Refer the students to the passages in the Reproducible Activity concerning hope. Paraphrase and discuss them. 

#### Discussing the Ideas 

1. How can our human imagination be our enemy when we picture the end times, especially when thinking about our own role in them? How can we keep it under control? 
2. What can we learn from the falls of both Lucifer and our first parents in regard to our relationship with God? 
3. Anxiety is a somewhat natural response to the chaos of the present age. How can we, as Christians, avoid the temptation to succumb to fear and panic? 
4. What are some ways we can display the peace, love, and hope we have in Christ to others who may not have them? 
5. How can we prevent the chaos and conflict of the world from manifesting itself in the Christian community? 
6. How does the Great Controversy theme help us to make sense of our own lives and world events? 

#### Closing the Activity

As Seventh-day Adventist Christians, we have been given a message that allows us to see beyond the appearances of the world and the situations in which we find ourselves. We can have meaning, hope, and purpose to our existence. It is our privilege to not only have these things, but to share them with others. Let us keep this in mind as we go out into a world of work and relationships where others may not have what we have.
