  title: "Preparation for the End Time"
  description: "In the final hours of Jesus’ earthly sojourn in human flesh, He spoke these words of comfort to the disciples:“ ‘Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me. In My Father’s house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I am, there you may be also. And where I go you know, and the way you know.’ ” (John 14:1–4, NKJV)."
