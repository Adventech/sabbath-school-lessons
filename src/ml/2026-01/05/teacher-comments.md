#### Part I: Overview

Key Text: Philippians 2:14, 15

Study Focus: Phil. 2:12–30, James 2

Christians are called to be lights in a dark world. Jesus said, “ ‘You are the light of the world’ ” (Matt. 5:14, NKJV). Similarly, Paul also revealed his desire for Christians to shine as light bearers in a world engulfed in darkness. His words to the Philippians, “You shine as lights in the world” (Phil. 2:15, NKJV), are very similar to the message sent to the Ephesians, “For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light” (Eph. 5:8, NKJV).

The metaphor of light is a powerful missionary symbol, used both in the Old and New Testaments. In Isaiah, God declares to His Servant, the Messiah, “ ‘ “I will also give You as a light to the Gentiles, that You should be My salvation to the ends of the earth” ’ ” (Isa. 49:6, NKJV; compare also with Isa. 42:6). This passage is applied to Jesus in the New Testament (see, for instance, Luke 2:32, John 8:12, John 9:5, Acts 26:23), but it is also applied to the church (Acts 13:47) because it continues Jesus’ mission of being Light to the world.

This week’s lesson emphasizes three major themes:

1.	We will consider the relationship between faith and works (Phil. 2:12, 13).

2.	As Christians, we are called to be lights to the world, following in Jesus’ footprints and sharing our lives with others.

3.	The trials and hardships that we face in our Christian walk strengthen us for greater challenges in God’s work. They are God’s tools for developing essential qualities that are indispensable for fruitful ministry.

#### Part II: Commentary

**Illustration**

Dwight L. Moody tells the story of two men “who had charge of a revolving light in a lighthouse on a storm-bound and rocky coast. Somehow the machinery went wrong, and the light did not revolve. They were so afraid that those at sea should mistake it for some other light, that they worked all the night through to keep the light moving around.” Moody concludes, “Let us keep our lights in the proper place, so that the world may see that the religion of Christ is not a sham but a reality.”—Moody, Anecdotes, Incidents, and Illustrations (Chicago: Moody Publishers, 1990), p. 36. Jesus used the metaphor of light in order to illustrate that faith becomes “visible” through good works (Matt. 5:16).

**Faith and Works**

C. S. Lewis makes this intriguing statement about the relationship between faith and works: “Christians have often disputed as to whether what leads the Christian home is good actions, or Faith in Christ. . . . The Bible really seems to clinch the matter when it puts the two things together into one amazing sentence. The first half is, ‘Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling’—which looks as if everything depended on us and our good actions: but the second half goes on, ‘For it is God who worketh in you’—which looks as if God did everything and we nothing. I am afraid that is the sort of thing we come up against in Christianity. I am puzzled, but I am not surprised.”—Lewis, Mere Christianity (New York: HarperCollins, 2001), pp. 148, 149.

In fact, Paul clarifies the relationship between faith and works in Philippians 2:12, 13. While we must work out our salvation, works do not have a salvific role. As James teaches, works are the evidence of a genuine and saving faith (James 2:18; compare with James 2:14). A faith without works is not faith whatsoever. In James’s words, this type of faith is dead (James 2:17, 26) and useless (James 2:20).

When saying “work out your own salvation with fear and trembling,” Paul is likely referring to the accountability that falls upon each Christian concerning the salvation they already have embraced through faith, which must be done “with fear and trembling” (Phil. 2:12, NKJV). In the original text in Greek, the phrase “with fear and trembling” is placed in the beginning of the sentence for emphasis: “With fear and trembling, work out your own salvation.”

Scholars debate the meaning of the phrase “with fear and trembling,” offering several interpretations, asserting it entails (1) concern over the possible risk of failure, (2) an attitude of submission to God, (3) humble devotion to God, or (4) a combination of all these things. Paul also applies this language in other parts of his writings. In 1 Corinthians 2:3, “fear” and “trembling” seem to reflect Paul’s anxiety about potentially failing in his mission in Corinth. In 2 Corinthians 7:15, these words point to the confidence Paul had that the Corinthians would accomplish what was expected of them (see 2 Cor. 7:16). In Ephesians 6:5, these words emphasize the importance of having a sense of duty. An analysis of these passages suggests that, by and large, the phrase “with fear and trembling” in Philippians 2:12 points to the high sense of responsibility believers are supposed to develop with regard to their salvation. Their works are an indication that they are taking this matter seriously.

**Lights to the World**

The imagery of light is consistently applied in the Bible as a metaphor for mission. In the Old Testament, God Himself is described as the ultimate Source from whom light emanates. The psalmist says, “The Lord is my light” (Ps 27:1, NKJV; see also Ps. 4:6, Ps. 89:15, Ps. 118:27, Isa. 2:5). Similarly, speaking on behalf of his people, the prophet Micah utters, “The Lord will be a light to me . . . . He will bring me forth to the light” (Mic. 7:8, 9, NKJV; see also Isa. 60:1, 2, 19, 20).

In Isaiah 42:6 and Isaiah 49:6, the Servant of the Lord is referred to as “ ‘a light to the Gentiles’ ” (NKJV). In Isaiah 49:6, the reader is provided with this further explanation: “ ‘ “That You should be My salvation to the ends of the earth.” ’ ” New Testament authors understood the metaphor and applied it consistently (Luke 2:32, John 8:12, John 9:5, Acts 13:47, Acts 26:23).

It is interesting that the most significant metaphor for the church in the early chapters of Revelation is the lampstands. In that regard, various scholars agree that the abandonment of the first love by some in the church of Ephesus has to do with the waning of their missionary zeal (Rev. 2:4). Thus, Jesus warns that, unless they repent, He would remove their “lampstand from its place” (Rev. 2:5, NKJV).

As mentioned previously, the phrase “the ends of the earth” occurs in Isaiah 49:6 in connection with the metaphor of light. It shows up twice in the book of Acts to portray the scope of the church’s mis­sionary task (Acts 1:8, Acts 13:47). Although the metaphor of light does not occur in Acts 1:8, it may be implied, based on Acts 13:47. These data shed light on Paul’s exhortation to the Philippians to shine “as lights in the world” (Phil. 2:15, NKJV). It’s important to note that Paul suggests that believers are truly lights in the world (Phil. 2:15) when they demonstrate unity among themselves (Phil. 2:14). After all, “the calling to be light is also a calling into the fellowship of light. Paul saw Christians as being joined together in a community by which they could encourage and strengthen one another as children of light (Eph. 5:8, 15–20).”—John M. Terry, Ebbie C. Smith, and Justice Anderson, eds., Missiology: An Introduction to the Foundations, History, and Strategies of World Missions (Nashville, TN: Broadman & Holman Publishers, 1998), p. 26.

**Qualities for a Successful Ministry**

From the description of Timothy and Epaphroditus in Philippians 2:19–30, one can infer several qualities essential for a successful ministry. Paul portrays Timothy as one who (1) is “like-minded” (Phil. 2:20, NKJV), (2) sincerely cares for others (Phil. 2:20), (3) seeks “the things which are of Christ Jesus” (Phil. 2:21, NKJV), (4) has a proven character (Phil. 2:22), and (5) demonstrates an attitude of service (Phil. 2:22). The Greek word rendered as “like-minded” is isopsichon, which occurs only here in the New Testament. It also appears once in the Septuagint (the Greek version of the Old Testament), in Psalm 55:13, where it is translated as “my equal” (NKJV).

Regarding Epaphroditus, Paul first portrays him in relation to himself: he is a brother, a fellow worker, and a fellow soldier. He is also a messenger (from Greek, apostolos) sent from Paul to the Philippians, and someone who ministered to Paul’s need (Phil. 2:25). This indicates that Epaphroditus was a very faithful and loyal companion. Afterward, Paul portrays him in relation to the Philippians. In that regard, Paul states, “He was longing for you all” (Phil. 2:26, NKJV). In other words, Paul is saying, “He misses you.” This suggests that, as a Christian leader, Epaphroditus deeply loved and cared for those whom he served. Epaphroditus was such a committed Christian leader that “for the work of Christ he came close to death, not regarding his life” (Phil. 2:30, NKJV). These men gave their all for the work of Christ. God also expects us to give our best, too!

#### Part III: Life Application

Meditate upon the following themes. Then ask your students to answer the questions at the end of this section.

We are completely dependent on God for salvation, which we receive through faith. Paul couldn’t have made it clearer when he said, “For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God” (Eph. 2:8, NKJV). It is through faith we journey from this life to the life to come. The letter to the Hebrews made this point very clear by consistently repeating the phrase “by faith” (see Hebrews 11). By faith, Abraham “dwelt in the land of promise as in a foreign country, . . . for he waited for the city which has foundations” (Heb. 11:9, 10, NKJV).

The experience of salvation unavoidably leads us to good works. Because good works are designed to benefit others (Gal. 6:9, 10), they are not natural for sinners (Jer. 13:23). That is why it is God who enables us to perform them (Phil. 2:13).

Jesus said to the disciples, “ ‘Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works’ ” (Matt. 5:16, NKJV). This command underscores the close relationship between letting our light shine and performing good works. By performing good works, believers are shining their light in this dark world. Darkness is a symbol of sin (see, for instance, John 3:19, 20; Luke 22:53) and its effects (see, for instance, Ps. 82:5, Eph. 4:18). Christians are called to enlighten this world with “the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ” (2 Cor. 4:4, NKJV), so as to shine on those “whose minds the god of this age has blinded” (2 Cor. 4:4, NKJV).

**Questions:**

1.	How are good works and the experience of salvation connected?

2.	What are ways you can let your light shine in this dark world?
