#### Part I: Overview

Key Text: Philippians 4:4

Study Focus: Rom. 8:12–39

Paul faced many trials and tribulations while spreading God’s message of salvation. Aside from Jesus, few have endured as much suffering as Paul did for the sake of the gospel. His list of hardships deserves our careful consideration and reflection. These hardships include, but are not limited to, tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, hunger, thirst, nakedness, the sword, beatings, homelessness, insults, slander, perplexities, privation, stripes, tumults, travail, sleeplessness, fastings, chastenings, pain, poverty, humiliation, stonings, shipwrecks, frequent journeys, life-threatening situations in various forms—whether from rivers, from robbers (both from among his own people and the Gentiles), or in the city, in the wilderness, at sea, and so on. Paul’s sufferings also come from his dealing with infirmities and weaknesses, along with the challenge of taking care of the churches. Obviously, his imprisonments cannot be ignored, either (compare with Rom. 8:35; 1 Cor. 4:11–13; 2 Cor. 4:8, 9; 2 Cor. 6:4, 5, 9, 10; 2 Cor. 11:23–29; 2 Cor. 12:10; Eph. 4:1). Paul’s life was far from easy!

One must take a deep breath to recite the entire preceding list without a pause. Not infrequently, many of us find ourselves discouraged about far less. Nevertheless, if Paul’s list of sufferings is impressive, his unwavering confidence is even more astonishing. He says, “Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us” (Rom. 8:37, NKJV).

This week’s lesson emphasizes two major themes:

1.	Paul’s sufferings for the sake of the gospel, most particularly his imprisonments.

2.	Paul’s strategies for preaching the gospel as effectively as possible, even under the most challenging circumstances.

#### Part II: Commentary

**Illustration**

G. Curtis Jones recounts a tale about medical missionary Wilfred Grenfell (1865–1940). When asked why he committed himself so wholeheartedly to Christian missions, Grenfell responded with the following story:

“Into a hospital where I was a resident physician, a woman was brought one night terribly burned. . . . Her husband had come home drunk and had thrown a paraffin lamp over her. The police were summoned and at last they brought in the half-sobered husband. The magistrate leaned over the bed and insisted that the patient tell the police exactly what happened. He impressed upon her the importance of telling the whole truth as she only had a little while to live.

“The poor soul turned her face from side to side, avoiding facing her husband, who stood at the foot of the bed. Finally her eyes rested on his strong hands, following them up his arms and shoulders and then across to his face. Their eyes met. Her expression of suffering momentarily disappeared, as tenderness and love colored her countenance. She looked at the magistrate and calmly said, ‘Sir, it was just an accident,’ and fell back on her pillow, dead. Grenfell added, ‘This was like God, and God is like that. His love sees through our sins.’ ” —Jones, 1000 Illustrations for Preaching and Teaching (Nashville, TN: Broadman & Holman Publishers, 1986), p. 55.

Curtis Jones describes this kind of love as a “suffering love.” Whether or not one agrees with what the woman did, and a very strong case could be made that she did wrong, still the point is powerful. Much like the love demonstrated by the woman in Grenfell’s story, Paul’s love also embraced suffering.

**Suffering Love**

In Romans 8:35, Paul expresses his deep assurance of Christ’s love for him—and for all of us—through a rhetorical question, “Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?” The expected answer is a resounding “No one!” If God “did not spare His own Son” (Rom. 8:32, NKJV), why would any hardship be able to separate us from the love of Christ? God proved His love by giving us His only Son, and with Him all things (Rom. 8:32). Paul did not need further evidence of God’s love. Neither do we.

Paul is so confident in God’s love that he mentions it repeatedly (Rom. 8:37, 39). Because of love, Jesus willingly endured suffering and death for us (John 13:1, 34; John 15:9, 12). In turn, Paul was willing to endure suffering and death for Him. As a matter of fact, only the love of Christ for us can sustain our faith in times of trial.

In Romans 8:35, Paul catalogs his hardships in a sevenfold list: tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, peril, and sword. Perhaps, this series of seven trials suggests completeness in the sense that it represents the totality of all the hardships Paul endured. As previously noted, Paul’s list of sufferings is much more extensive than this catalog. Up to this point, he had endured all the tribulations in this passage except for the seventh element, the sword. The sword would become his last trial, and he faced it with remarkable courage. His unwavering assurance in Christ enabled him to confront death with inner peace. At the moment of his death, Paul “was looking into the great beyond, not with uncertainty or in dread, but with joyful hope and longing expectation. As he stood at the place of martyrdom he saw not the gleaming sword of the executioner or the green earth so soon to receive his blood; he looked up through the calm blue heaven of that summer’s day to the throne of the Eternal. His language was, O Lord, Thou art my comfort and my portion. When shall I embrace Thee? When shall I behold Thee for myself, without a dimming veil between?”—Ellen G. White, The Story of Redemption, pp. 317, 318.

Paul was confident that if we share in Jesus’ sufferings, we will also “be glorified with Him” (Rom. 8:17, NASB). He fought the good fight, finished the race, and kept the faith. He knew a crown of righteousness would be given to him at the resurrection, when Christ returns (see 1 Cor. 15:51–55; 2 Tim 4:7, 8).

**Paul’s Strategies for Preaching the Gospel**

Given the arduous circumstances under which Paul preached the gospel, he needed to employ wise strategies to ensure the success of his work.

First, Paul intentionally selected important cities of the ancient world from which he could more easily spread the gospel message. Thus, for instance, Corinth was chosen for its privileged geographic location. “An opportunity was thus presented for the spread of the gospel. Once established at Corinth, it would be readily communicated to all parts of the world.”—Ellen G. White, Sketches From the Life of Paul, p. 99. Paul also focused on Philippi because it was one of “the most influential urban centers on his route. . . . Its strategic significance in the history of the empire made it a natural evangelistic step for one being prepared to reach Rome.”—Craig S. Keener, Acts: An Exegetical Commentary, vol. 3 (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2014), pp. 2380, 2381. Likewise, Ephesus was one of the largest cities in the Roman Empire, boasting a population of approximately 250,000 people in Paul’s time.

Second, Paul invested time in training people for evangelistic ministry. Indeed, he “made it a part of his work to educate young men for the gospel ministry. He took them with him on his missionary journeys, and thus they gained an experience that later enabled them to fill positions of responsibility. When separated from them, he still kept in touch with their work, and his letters to Timothy and Titus are an evidence of how deep was his desire for their success.”—Ellen G. White, Gospel Workers, p. 102. As far as Timothy is concerned, Paul took him to be not only his coworker but also a coauthor (see 2 Cor. 1:1, Phil. 1:1, Col. 1:1, 1 Thess. 1:1, 2 Thess. 1:1, and Philem. 1:1).

Third, Paul followed the “to-the-Jew-first” approach (Acts 13:46, Rom. 1:16) as Jesus explicitly commanded (Luke 24:47; Acts 1:8; Acts 3:25, 26). This approach explains why Paul began his missionary endeavors in a new city at the synagogue (Acts 9:20; Acts 13:5, 14, 46; Acts 14:1; Acts 17:1, 2, 17; Acts 18:4). Reflecting on the instruction that the disciples’ work should start in Jerusalem, Ellen G. White says, “Wherever the people of God are placed, in the crowded cities, in the villages, or among the country by-ways, there is a home mission field. . . . First of all is the work in the family; next they should seek to win their neighbors to Christ, and to bring before them the great truths of this time.”—Advent Review and Sabbath Herald, May 22, 1888.

Fourth, Paul maintained regular communication with the churches by sending letters to them. Because of his “deep concern for all the churches” (2 Cor. 11:28, NKJV), he often couldn’t remain long with the new converts in the cities where he preached. Thus, he utilized letters as a means of keeping in touch with the churches and providing instructions to them. The letters also served as a way of filling the void caused by his physical absence (1 Cor. 5:3, Phil. 2:12).

#### Part III: Life Application

Meditate upon the following themes. Then ask your students to answer the following questions.

Preaching the gospel can be challenging for many Christians, especially when societal norms conflict with the Word of God. Across the centuries, countless people have faced suffering, and even death, in the fulfillment of their missionary work. This reality was true in the early days of the Christian mission, and it will be no different at its conclusion (Rev. 14:13). As we continue in missionary work and endure the sufferings that attend it, there is only one force that can sustain us: the love of Christ.

Most Christians realize the risks involved in following Christ, but we also must understand the paramount importance of fulfilling the commission, “ ‘Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations’ ” (Matt. 28:19, NKJV). The task is arduous, but we trust in God’s guidance every step of the way. Though it may become life-threatening in various forms, the task is rewarding. Jesus says, “ ‘Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life’ ” (Rev. 2:10, NKJV).

In his missionary work, Paul employed various strategies to ensure its effectiveness: (1) He selected important cities as supporting outposts from which he could more easily spread the gospel message. (2) He invested time in training others. (3) He prioritized reaching those closest to him first. (4) He constantly kept in touch with those to whom he ministered. We should integrate all these strategies into our own missionary endeavors. Paul knew, however, that although strategies are important, they can never replace the role of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 12:1–11, Eph. 4:1–6). We must never forget this vital point.

**Questions:**

1.	What are some of the challenges that you have faced in preaching the gospel?

2.	How have you employed Paul’s four missionary strategies previously listed, and what were the results?
