### Part #13 Choose This Day Whom You Will Serve

Welcome to Hope Sabbath School—an in-depth interactive study of the Word of God. We are concluding a series of studies on Lessons of Faith from Joshua. Today’s topic: CHOOSE THIS DAY WHOM YOU WILL SERVE.

**Scripture Song:** Be strong and of good courage – Deut. 31:6

- **Gathering at Shechem**
	- Joshua 24:1 Why was Shechem an appropriate location to renew their covenant with the LORD? (see Genesis 12:6-7)
	- Joshua 24:2-13 How was Joshua able to recount such a detailed message from the LORD? (see 2 Peter 1:19-21)
	- How would you summarize this message from the LORD in your own words?
	- Why is it important to remember the way the LORD has led us in the past?
- **The appeal of Joshua**
	- Joshua 24:14-15 What appeal did Joshua make to the children of Israel?
	- What does it mean to “fear the LORD”? Support your answer from the Scriptures. (Psalm 34:2-8, Proverbs 9:10, 10:27, etc.)
	- Why did Joshua need to ask the children of Israel to throw away the gods of their ancestors? (the example of their ancestor Rachel--Genesis 31:34)
	- What are some idols of our ancestors we might be clinging to that need to be thrown away?
	- What does it mean to serve the LORD “in sincerity and truth”?
	- Read Joshua 24:15 again. Why is it important for a leader to set a godly example for those under his or her care?
	- How can you be a godly example to those around you, especially to those who look to you as their leader? Galatians 2:20, 1 Corinthians 11:1, Philippians 4:13, etc.
- **Israel’s response**
	- Joshua 24:16-18 How did the children of Israel respond to Joshua’s appeal?
	- Joshua 24:19-21 What are your thoughts about Joshua’s reaction to their response?
	- What reason did Joshua have to respond as he did? Exodus 19:8, 24:3,7, etc.
	- Joshua 24:22-24 Why did Joshua need to repeat the exhortation to throw away their idols and what are your thoughts about the response of the people?
	- Compare their response to that of new Christians in Ephesus. Acts 19:18-19
	- Why is yielding our hearts to the LORD our God the only sure defense against idolatry? James 4:7-8
	- What is your response to the lessons you have learned from the story of Joshua?
